31947::$$$message_0256_0000_0000$$$::The gigantic figure flies through the air.[lr]::
31948::$$$message_0256_0000_0001$$$::This "Berserker" comes tearing down from the top of the hill almost faster than I can follow!::
31949::$$$message_0256_0001_0000$$$::"Shirou, stay back...!"[lr]::
31950::$$$message_0256_0001_0001$$$::In the moonlight...[lr]::
31951::$$$message_0256_0001_0002$$$::...a shower of...bullet-things rain onto the onrushing giant like shooting stars...!::
31952::$$$message_0256_0002_0000$$$::"[wacky len=15]"[lr]::
31953::$$$message_0256_0002_0001$$$::So, this is supernatural accuracy at work.[lr]::
31954::$$$message_0256_0002_0002$$$::The silver lights peppering the giant are arrows.::
31955::$$$message_0256_0003_0000$$$::That's probably underselling it, though.[lr]::
31956::$$$message_0256_0003_0001$$$::It's more like strafing fire from a machine gun; each blow is powerful enough to pierce bedrock.[lr]::
31957::$$$message_0256_0003_0002$$$::   Eight shots of that.[lr]::
31958::$$$message_0256_0003_0003$$$::The barrage is more than powerful enough to reduce a house to smoking rubble.::
31959::$$$message_0256_0004_0000$$$::"Are you kidding me!? It did nothing!!!"[lr]::
31960::$$$message_0256_0004_0001$$$::The giant is completely unaffected.::
31961::$$$message_0256_0005_0000$$$::The two swords clash.[lr]::
31962::$$$message_0256_0005_0001$$$::The massive sword wielded by the Berserker amid a hail of arrows... [lr]::
31963::$$$message_0256_0005_0002$$$::...and the sword of Saber, who rushes to meet him, collide with a deafening clang, sending sparks flying.::
31964::$$$message_0256_0005_0003$$$::"Hnng...!"[lr]::
31965::$$$message_0256_0005_0004$$$::"[wacky len=6]"[lr]::
31966::$$$message_0256_0005_0005$$$::The two blades strain against each other.[lr]::
31967::$$$message_0256_0005_0006$$$::In spite of Berserker's overwhelming strength, Saber does not give ground.::
31968::$$$message_0256_0005_0007$$$::   Silver lights flash through the darkness.[lr]::
31969::$$$message_0256_0005_0008$$$::Just how much magical energy is stored inside that small body of hers?[lr]::
31970::$$$message_0256_0005_0009$$$::She's clearly weaker, but she doesn't budge an inch.[lr]::
31971::$$$message_0256_0005_0010$$$::She blocks, parries, and cuts through the whirlwind of attacks from the giant's massive sword.::
31972::$$$message_0256_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31973::$$$message_0256_0006_0001$$$::The spectacle takes my breath away, and I'm not alone in that.[lr]::
31974::$$$message_0256_0006_0002$$$::Toshaka and the giant's Master stand beside me, watching in fascination as the fight unfolds.::
31975::$$$message_0256_0007_0000$$$::"...! Archer, back her up...!"[lr]::
31976::$$$message_0256_0007_0001$$$::Another silver light flashes across the battlefield in response to Tohsaka's command.::
31977::$$$message_0256_0008_0000$$$::It drives viciously into the giant's temple.[lr]::
31978::$$$message_0256_0008_0001$$$::Archer's arrow impacts the giant with all the force of an artillery shell.[lr]::
31979::$$$message_0256_0008_0002$$$::No matter how strong that giant might be, there's no way that won't do some real damage.::
31980::$$$message_0256_0009_0000$$$::"Got him...!"[lr]::
31981::$$$message_0256_0009_0001$$$::Saber follows up with a slash from her invisible sword.[lr]::
31982::$$$message_0256_0009_0002$$$::However...[lr]::
31983::$$$message_0256_0009_0003$$$::A savage counterattack strikes with such force that Saber is sent flying.::
31984::$$$message_0256_0010_0000$$$::"Hrrk...!?"[lr]::
31985::$$$message_0256_0010_0001$$$::Saber slides across the asphalt.::
31986::$$$message_0256_0011_0000$$$::The black whirlwind surges after her.[lr]::
31987::$$$message_0256_0011_0001$$$::Silver lights burst all around in attempts to obstruct the whirlwind.[lr]::
31988::$$$message_0256_0011_0002$$$::It does...nothing.[lr]::
31989::$$$message_0256_0011_0003$$$::Three arrows strike the giant's forehead with perfect precision, only to disappear.::
31990::$$$message_0256_0012_0000$$$::"[wacky len=9]!!!"[lr]::
31991::$$$message_0256_0012_0001$$$::The giant does not stop.[lr]::
31992::$$$message_0256_0012_0002$$$::Saber catches his attack on her blade...::
31993::$$$message_0256_0013_0000$$$::"Saber...!"[lr]::
31994::$$$message_0256_0013_0001$$$::My scream does nothing.[lr]::
31995::$$$message_0256_0013_0002$$$::The sheer force of Berserker's blow is such that, even though Saber blocks it, she's slammed to the ground with a tremendous thud.::
31996::$$$message_0256_0014_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
31997::$$$message_0256_0014_0001$$$::Is she feeling dizzy?[lr]::
31998::$$$message_0256_0014_0002$$$::Saber is on her knees, not moving.[lr]::
31999::$$$message_0256_0014_0003$$$::"This is it. Crush her, Berserker."[lr]::
32000::$$$message_0256_0014_0004$$$::The girl's voice echoes across the battlefield.[lr]::
32001::$$$message_0256_0014_0005$$$::The black giant charges towards Saber with terrifying speed.::
32002::$$$message_0256_0015_0000$$$::"Archer, keep shooting...!"[lr]::
32003::$$$message_0256_0015_0001$$$::Tohsaka yells as she starts running.[lr]::
32004::$$$message_0256_0015_0002$$$::She must be intending to help Saber.[lr]::
32005::$$$message_0256_0015_0003$$$::Tohsaka runs up the hill and takes what looks like a rock in hand.::
32006::$$$message_0256_0016_0000$$$::"Gewicht, um zu Verdoppelung! (Pressure, shackles of obsidian!)"[lr]::
32007::$$$message_0256_0016_0001$$$::She throws obsidian stones into the air and...[lr]::
32008::$$$message_0256_0016_0002$$$::...a storm of silver light rains from the sky.[lr]::
32009::$$$message_0256_0016_0003$$$::The attack doesn't even slow Berserker's charge.::
32010::$$$message_0256_0016_0004$$$::"What a..."[lr]::
32011::$$$message_0256_0016_0005$$$::[font italic=true]...Monster.[font italic=false][lr]::
32012::$$$message_0256_0016_0006$$$::Even I can see how absurdly strong he is now.[lr]::
32013::$$$message_0256_0016_0007$$$::"Strong" isn't even a big enough word for that monster.[lr]::
32014::$$$message_0256_0016_0008$$$::It must be protected by some kind of law of immortality woven with an insane amount of magical energy.::
32015::$$$message_0256_0017_0000$$$::"It's fine, just ignore the noise.[lr]::
32016::$$$message_0256_0017_0001$$$::Archer and Rin's attacks can't get past your Noble Phantasm anyway."[lr]::
32017::$$$message_0256_0017_0002$$$::The girl's voice carries clearly to me.[lr]::
32018::$$$message_0256_0017_0003$$$::The giant swings his huge sword...::
32019::$$$message_0256_0018_0000$$$::...and...[lr]::
32020::$$$message_0256_0018_0001$$$::Saber blocks bravely, but the force of the blow flings her away once again.::
32021::$$$message_0256_0018_0002$$$::   She is blown away dozens of meters up the hill.[lr]::
32022::$$$message_0256_0018_0003$$$::Saber is sent in a perfectly straight line, like a pitcher's fastball before smashing into the barren road.::
32023::$$$message_0256_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32024::$$$message_0256_0019_0001$$$::She must be dead.[lr]::
32025::$$$message_0256_0019_0002$$$::She might have survived one blow.[lr]::
32026::$$$message_0256_0019_0003$$$::But there's no way she's okay after receiving two blows from that giant's large sword. No chance.::
32027::$$$message_0256_0020_0000$$$::The dark whirlwind surges toward her.[lr]::
32028::$$$message_0256_0020_0001$$$::It's already over. Hasn't that thing had enough?[lr]::
32029::$$$message_0256_0020_0002$$$::Still, the monstrous thing charges across the barren road.::
32030::$$$message_0256_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32031::$$$message_0256_0021_0001$$$::She's going to die.[lr]::
32032::$$$message_0256_0021_0002$$$::Even if, somehow, Saber is still alive, she'll die here and now.[lr]::
32033::$$$message_0256_0021_0003$$$::And...[lr]::
32034::$$$message_0256_0021_0004$$$::...so long as I'm here, I'm dead too.::
32035::$$$message_0256_0022_0000$$$::"Run, if you can!"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
32036::$$$message_0256_0022_0001$$$::I can't see Tohsaka, but I can hear her.[lr]::
32037::$$$message_0256_0022_0002$$$::She went after Berserker.[lr]::
32038::$$$message_0256_0022_0003$$$::Even after this monster is unscathed from so many powerful attacks, she means to keep fighting it?::
32039::$$$message_0256_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32040::$$$message_0256_0023_0001$$$::I...[lr]::
