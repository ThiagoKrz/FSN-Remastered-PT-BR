13576::$$$message_0132_0000_0000$$$::Once we pass through the exceptionally tall trees, something unexpected comes into our view.::
13577::$$$message_0132_0001_0000$$$::"A...ruin...?"[lr]::
13578::$$$message_0132_0001_0001$$$::"We should be able to hide out here for a while.[lr]::
13579::$$$message_0132_0001_0002$$$::Archer found this place on our way up here. He said we could use it as a hideout just in case."::
13580::$$$message_0132_0002_0000$$$::Trees choke the ruins.[lr]::
13581::$$$message_0132_0002_0001$$$::Only one of the rooms on the second floor remains more or less intact.[lr]::
13582::$$$message_0132_0002_0002$$$::The windows are miraculously undamaged, and the brilliant moonlight casts the room in its pale glow.::
13583::$$$message_0132_0003_0000$$$::"Huh. It's pretty clean in here. Maybe someone was staying here recently."::
13584::$$$message_0132_0004_0000$$$::Nothing fazes this girl.[lr]::
13585::$$$message_0132_0004_0001$$$::Tohsaka steps over the rubble and pats the bed near the wall with both hands.[lr]::
13586::$$$message_0132_0004_0002$$$::"Shirou, over here. We should lay Saber here. Getting carried can actually be pretty tiring, you know."::
13587::$$$message_0132_0005_0000$$$::"Oh. Yeah. I'll be right there."[lr]::
13588::$$$message_0132_0005_0001$$$::I lay Saber on the old, beat-up bed.::
13589::$$$message_0132_0006_0000$$$::"How are you holding up, Saber? Can you still move?"[lr]::
13590::$$$message_0132_0006_0001$$$::"Yes, I am fine since Shirou carried me here. It seems I can still maintain my body."::
13591::$$$message_0132_0007_0000$$$::"Okay. Then there's only one issue left.[lr]::
13592::$$$message_0132_0007_0001$$$::It's been an hour... It might take a little longer even if Illyasviel's going to pursue us. No, we might be able to hide here until morning if they have trouble finding us."::
13593::$$$message_0132_0008_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
13594::$$$message_0132_0008_0001$$$::She's just reminded me of something.[lr]::
13595::$$$message_0132_0008_0002$$$::We've run as far as this ruins, but what happened with Berserker and Archer?[lr]::
13596::$$$message_0132_0008_0003$$$::He stayed in the castle to hold Berserker off.[lr]::
13597::$$$message_0132_0008_0004$$$::It's already been an hour... Archer should have retreated from the castle by now.::
13598::$$$message_0132_0009_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, he[line2]"[lr]::
13599::$$$message_0132_0009_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
13600::$$$message_0132_0009_0002$$$::Tohsaka doesn't respond.[lr]::
13601::$$$message_0132_0009_0003$$$::She only presses her right hand to her heart, like she's clutching something precious.::
13602::$$$message_0132_0010_0000$$$::...And that's enough to tell me what happened to Archer.[lr]::
13603::$$$message_0132_0010_0001$$$::Tohsaka's Command Spell is on her right arm.[lr]::
13604::$$$message_0132_0010_0002$$$::A Master and their Servant are connected.[lr]::
13605::$$$message_0132_0010_0003$$$::In the same way Saber was able to detect when I was in danger, a Master can sense whether their Servant is alive or dead...::
13606::$$$message_0132_0011_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, he..."::
13607::$$$message_0132_0012_0000$$$::"Yeah... And I told him to just buy us some time.[lr]::
13608::$$$message_0132_0012_0001$$$::That guy...he was pretentious till the very end."[lr]::
13609::$$$message_0132_0012_0002$$$::...Silence falls between us.[lr]::
13610::$$$message_0132_0012_0003$$$::It feels like the silence will last forever, but then...::
13611::$$$message_0132_0013_0000$$$::"But I won't let it be meaningless. Since I've lost Archer, I'm going to defeat Berserker here."[lr]::
13612::$$$message_0132_0013_0001$$$::The sound of Tohsaka punching her hand into her fist breaks the silence.::
13613::$$$message_0132_0014_0000$$$::"No more mourning. My rule is that I should take action if I have time to worry. We've come this far, so now I'm going to have you make a decision too."[lr]::
13614::$$$message_0132_0014_0001$$$::"Huh? What kind of decision?"::
13615::$$$message_0132_0015_0000$$$::"You should know very well. The decision to defeat Illyasviel...by killing Berserker.[lr]::
13616::$$$message_0132_0015_0001$$$::If we have Saber with us, we can't get out of this forest, and having her recover naturally would take too long. Whichever we try, Illya catches us."::
13617::$$$message_0132_0016_0000$$$::"Don't you get it? If the three of us are ever going to leave this forest, we need to defeat Berserker.[lr]::
13618::$$$message_0132_0016_0001$$$::If we can't do that, we're just going to follow Archer."::
13619::$$$message_0132_0017_0000$$$::"Defeat...Berserker...?"[lr]::
13620::$$$message_0132_0017_0001$$$::That monster?[lr]::
13621::$$$message_0132_0017_0002$$$::Defeat that invincible whirlwind of death?::
13622::$$$message_0132_0018_0000$$$::...[lr]::
13623::$$$message_0132_0018_0001$$$::I can't imagine that being possible.[lr]::
13624::$$$message_0132_0018_0002$$$::If we fight, we die.[lr]::
13625::$$$message_0132_0018_0003$$$::Tohsaka should understand that perfectly herself.[lr]::
13626::$$$message_0132_0018_0004$$$::Is her plan still to defeat him, even knowing that?::
13627::$$$message_0132_0019_0000$$$::"No, that's wrong."[lr]::
13628::$$$message_0132_0019_0001$$$::What am I saying?[lr]::
13629::$$$message_0132_0019_0002$$$::Tohsaka's not saying we can beat it.[lr]::
13630::$$$message_0132_0019_0003$$$::She's not so blindly optimistic.::
13631::$$$message_0132_0020_0000$$$::"Yeah...got it..."[lr]::
13632::$$$message_0132_0020_0001$$$::We're not going to beat him to win.[lr]::
13633::$$$message_0132_0020_0002$$$::...I should've realized that from the very beginning.[lr]::
13634::$$$message_0132_0020_0003$$$::"We HAVE to beat him, don't we?"[lr]::
13635::$$$message_0132_0020_0004$$$::That's all there is to it.[lr]::
13636::$$$message_0132_0020_0005$$$::   If we don't want to die here.[lr]::
13637::$$$message_0132_0020_0006$$$::We [font italic=true]have[font italic=false] to defeat that monster.::
13638::$$$message_0132_0021_0000$$$::"Exactly. Things aren't as dire as you might think, either.[lr]::
13639::$$$message_0132_0021_0001$$$::Yeah, it's Berserker, but he should be wounded after fighting Archer. I've brought my entire jewel collection, and if Saber can recover, then we can come up with a plan or two."::
13640::$$$message_0132_0022_0000$$$::"In fact...[lr]::
13641::$$$message_0132_0022_0001$$$::Don't you think this is our best opportunity to defeat Illyasviel since Berserker's wounded?"::
13642::$$$message_0132_0023_0000$$$::"But is there a way to heal Saber? This isn't the best place to treat her."::
13643::$$$message_0132_0024_0000$$$::"No. Location isn't the important thing for treating Saber.[lr]::
13644::$$$message_0132_0024_0001$$$::Saber is only weak because she's out of magical energy. If we can replenish enough of that magical energy, she should be able to use her abilities like before."::
13645::$$$message_0132_0025_0000$$$::Tohsaka's explanation reminds me of late last night.[lr]::
13646::$$$message_0132_0025_0001$$$::She said that Saber's magical energy was mostly gone.[lr]::
13647::$$$message_0132_0025_0002$$$::Which is why, to restore Saber's magical energy...::
13648::$$$message_0132_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"If you want to save Saber, you'll need to tell her to attack people, and eat their souls."[font italic=false]::
13649::$$$message_0132_0027_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"Then there's only one answer."[font italic=false][lr]::
13650::$$$message_0132_0027_0001$$$::[font italic=true]"Use a Command Spell, Emiya. That should at least let you avoid the worst case here."[font italic=false]::
13651::$$$message_0132_0028_0000$$$::I have two Command Spells left.[lr]::
13652::$$$message_0132_0028_0001$$$::I'll use one to make Saber attack people so she can devour their souls to replenish her magical energy.[lr]::
13653::$$$message_0132_0028_0002$$$::If Saber won't recover, we can't defeat Berserker. If we can't defeat Berserker, then he'll kill us.::
13654::$$$message_0132_0029_0000$$$::I look at Saber where she lies.[lr]::
13655::$$$message_0132_0029_0001$$$::...We're just letting her suffer at this point. But...::
13656::$$$message_0132_0030_0000$$$::"No. I still can't agree to let Saber attack innocent people."[lr]::
13657::$$$message_0132_0030_0001$$$::"Yes. I actually agree this time."[lr]::
13658::$$$message_0132_0030_0002$$$::"Huh?"::
13659::$$$message_0132_0031_0000$$$::"If we were somewhere else, I might have suggested it.[lr]::
13660::$$$message_0132_0031_0001$$$::But we're in Illyasviel's forest. There's not a single human soul around. There might be some people besides Illya and Berserker in the castle, but going back there is a suicide mission."[lr]::
13661::$$$message_0132_0031_0002$$$::"For Saber to eat souls, we'd have to be out of this place, so that's not going to happen right now."::
13662::$$$message_0132_0032_0000$$$::Tohsaka nods.[lr]::
13663::$$$message_0132_0032_0001$$$::I'm relieved not to have to make Saber attack people, but then how are we supposed to replenish Saber's magical energy?::
13664::$$$message_0132_0033_0000$$$::"So what do we need to do, Tohsaka? This whole problem comes from me not being able to provide Saber with magical energy."::
13665::$$$message_0132_0034_0000$$$::"There are other ways. I thought I explained that to you yesterday...er, I guess it's the day before yesterday now.[lr]::
13666::$$$message_0132_0034_0001$$$::Sharing magical energy with a Servant can be accomplished by sharing magecraft and a handful of other methods. Back then...well, I didn't say anything because I never thought we would end up in a situation like this."::
13667::$$$message_0132_0035_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
13668::$$$message_0132_0035_0001$$$::I try to think back to our conversation that night.[lr]::
13669::$$$message_0132_0035_0002$$$::Now that she mentions it, she said something like...::
13670::$$$message_0132_0036_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"Well, a path should have been created between you and Saber during her summoning, so there might be a different way, but..."[font italic=false]::
13671::$$$message_0132_0037_0000$$$::I think that's what Tohsaka said.::
13672::$$$message_0132_0038_0000$$$::"I remember now. You said something about a path, and that there's some other method besides magecraft."[lr]::
13673::$$$message_0132_0038_0001$$$::Right...?[lr]::
13674::$$$message_0132_0038_0002$$$::Or did I get it wrong?[lr]::
13675::$$$message_0132_0038_0003$$$::At the time, I was shocked to learn that I had to make Saber attack people, so I might have misheard her.::
13676::$$$message_0132_0039_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. Is there another way?"[lr]::
13677::$$$message_0132_0039_0001$$$::"Yeah. There are two options I can help you with, but this isn't exactly an ideal situation for either."::
13678::$$$message_0132_0040_0000$$$::"Listen. Saber lacks magical energy because the path between you two is incomplete. In order for her to recover, we need to reform the path between you to make it work properly."[lr]::
13679::$$$message_0132_0040_0001$$$::"That's probably the best solution, but I don't know how to do it."[lr]::
13680::$$$message_0132_0040_0002$$$::Saber's summoning was messed up from the start. If I had been able to make a connection to supply her with magical energy, we wouldn't be in this mess.::
13681::$$$message_0132_0041_0000$$$::"It's quite simple. We need you and Saber to bond properly and reconnect your spiritual path. That's the only way to fix a path without breaking the contract or resummoning her.[lr]::
13682::$$$message_0132_0041_0001$$$::And to do that, we need to transplant your Magic Circuits to Saber."[lr]::
13683::$$$message_0132_0041_0002$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
13684::$$$message_0132_0041_0003$$$::...Transplant my Magic Circuits to Saber?::
13685::$$$message_0132_0042_0000$$$::"To establish the path between you and Saber, we need to transplant spiritually important organs.[lr]::
13686::$$$message_0132_0042_0001$$$::If the Servant and Master are borrowing the Holy Grail's power, we need to create a connection just as strong or else the path won't be formed.[lr]::
13687::$$$message_0132_0042_0002$$$::And to accomplish that, we need to transplant the Master's Magic Circuits to their Servant. It's going to require something that extreme, or your powers won't reach Saber."::
13688::$$$message_0132_0043_0000$$$::Magic Circuits.[lr]::
13689::$$$message_0132_0043_0001$$$::An indispensable mechanism for mages that uses od to activate mana. It's the core of a mage's existence, and without it, the magical energy that serves as the source of a mage's power can't be created.[lr]::
13690::$$$message_0132_0043_0002$$$::To a mage, their Magic Circuits are more important than life itself. They see them as the thing that gives their existence value.::
13691::$$$message_0132_0044_0000$$$::"It's too dangerous to transplant a Servant's circuit to a Master. Transplanting the circuits of Ghost Liners, especially Heroic Spirits, into a dying person pretty much only leads to severe rejection.[lr]::
13692::$$$message_0132_0044_0001$$$::So, our only remaining option is to transplant your circuits to Saber."::
13693::$$$message_0132_0045_0000$$$::"But it amounts to ripping nerves out of your body. Which means the burden here will be..."[lr]::
13694::$$$message_0132_0045_0001$$$::Entirely on the one offering the transplant.[lr]::
13695::$$$message_0132_0045_0002$$$::Ripping out nerves is the same as amputating fingers or even arms.::
13696::$$$message_0132_0046_0000$$$::"Please wait, Rin.[lr]::
13697::$$$message_0132_0046_0001$$$::That would be too much for Shirou..."[lr]::
13698::$$$message_0132_0046_0002$$$::"And if we don't do it, none of us will survive. You should know that, Saber."[lr]::
13699::$$$message_0132_0046_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
13700::$$$message_0132_0046_0004$$$::I gulp as quietly as I can.[lr]::
13701::$$$message_0132_0046_0005$$$::I have to get my priorities straight.[lr]::
13702::$$$message_0132_0046_0006$$$::We don't have time for me to hesitate when what needs to be done is clear.::
13703::$$$message_0132_0047_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. Can you make this work?"[lr]::
13704::$$$message_0132_0047_0001$$$::"...I'll make it work, yes. But even if it works, it's not going to be safe or easy.[lr]::
13705::$$$message_0132_0047_0002$$$::I have no intention of failing, but even if I succeed, your Magic Circuits will go to Saber. You will experience such an intense sense of loss and pain, you'll wish I failed."[lr]::
13706::$$$message_0132_0047_0003$$$::...[lr]::
13707::$$$message_0132_0047_0004$$$::"If your Magic Circuits are taken from you, that means you..."::
13708::$$$message_0132_0048_0000$$$::It would mean that my secondary nerve[line2]my missing Magic Circuits[line2]would be like a piece torn from my psyche, and would damage the spiritual body's integrity, creating a fatal flaw in me as a mage.[lr]::
13709::$$$message_0132_0048_0001$$$::I will never regain that missing piece for as long as I live. My hope of becoming a full-fledged mage from experience alone will die.[lr]::
13710::$$$message_0132_0048_0002$$$::Once I lose my foundation[line2]my Magic Circuits[line2]I will always be incomplete, no matter what.::
13711::$$$message_0132_0049_0000$$$::...[lr]::
13712::$$$message_0132_0049_0001$$$::I nod, for my own sake.[lr]::
13713::$$$message_0132_0049_0002$$$::Is that all?[lr]::
13714::$$$message_0132_0049_0003$$$::I'd rather save Saber.::
13715::$$$message_0132_0050_0000$$$::"Okay. Let's do it, Tohsaka."[lr]::
13716::$$$message_0132_0050_0001$$$::"That was fast! [wait canskip=0 time=600][chgfg textoff=0 time=300 storage=凛私服09e(中)] Oh well, I guess it's fine you decided so fast, but do you really understand what you're getting into!?"[lr]::
13717::$$$message_0132_0050_0002$$$::"I do. You already told me."[lr]::
13718::$$$message_0132_0050_0003$$$::"Of course you don't![lr]::
13719::$$$message_0132_0050_0004$$$::Listen. I've basically just told you that you're going to have to die as a mage to save Saber. How can you just agree without any questions or objections!?"::
13720::$$$message_0132_0051_0000$$$::"Because I don't have any objections.[lr]::
13721::$$$message_0132_0051_0001$$$::I'm agreeing because it's the best plan we have. You should be more confident in your own plan. Seeing you panic like that is making me worry.[lr]::
13722::$$$message_0132_0051_0002$$$::And if we don't do this, Saber can't fight Berserker, right?"::
13723::$$$message_0132_0052_0000$$$::"Right. That's what I've been saying."[lr]::
13724::$$$message_0132_0052_0001$$$::"See? And it's not like we haven't made any sacrifices. We have to fight and win, since he bought us time."[lr]::
13725::$$$message_0132_0052_0002$$$::His stance told me to go.[lr]::
13726::$$$message_0132_0052_0003$$$::I didn't like him, but if he was willing to risk his life to protect his Master, Tohsaka, I can't back out now.::
13727::$$$message_0132_0053_0000$$$::"Fine. Let's begin, Shirou."[lr]::
13728::$$$message_0132_0053_0001$$$::"Yeah. Are you ready, Saber?[lr]::
13729::$$$message_0132_0053_0002$$$::We're going to transplant my Magic Circuits to you."[lr]::
13730::$$$message_0132_0053_0003$$$::"Yes. If that is your decision, Master."[lr]::
13731::$$$message_0132_0053_0004$$$::I hear neither affirmation nor denial in her voice.[lr]::
13732::$$$message_0132_0053_0005$$$::...But her eyes seem filled with regret.::
13733::$$$message_0132_0054_0000$$$::I guess Tohsaka is going to prepare us for the transplant.[lr]::
13734::$$$message_0132_0054_0001$$$::I don't know the procedure, so I just have to leave it all to Tohsaka.::
13735::$$$message_0132_0055_0000$$$::"We'll start with Saber. Shirou, keep your Magic Circuits on and just try to keep your mind clear."[lr]::
13736::$$$message_0132_0055_0001$$$::...I close my eyes and switch over the artificial nerve in my body.[lr]::
13737::$$$message_0132_0055_0002$$$::Thanks to Tohsaka's instruction, I've been able to turn my circuits on and off effortlessly...::
13738::$$$message_0132_0056_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
13739::$$$message_0132_0056_0001$$$::A red flower entangles the white flower.[lr]::
13740::$$$message_0132_0056_0002$$$::Tohsaka climbs up to straddle Saber, who lies still. Then, she begins to run her fingers freely along the curves of Saber's slender form.::
13741::$$$message_0132_0057_0000$$$::"Tohsaka... What are you doing to Saber?"[lr]::
13742::$$$message_0132_0057_0001$$$::"What do you mean? I'm doing this to help Saber relax. We won't have as good a chance of success if Saber can't relax."[lr]::
13743::$$$message_0132_0057_0002$$$::"Oh...uh...okay. Sorry. Continue."::
13744::$$$message_0132_0058_0000$$$::"Okay.[lr]::

13928::$$$message_0132_0106_0002$$$::The pinnacle of all beasts...appearing at times as a demon, at times a god.[lr]::
13929::$$$message_0132_0106_0003$$$::This is what lies in Saber's subconscious. [lr]::
13930::$$$message_0132_0106_0004$$$::Its otherworldly form suits the Servant said to be the best.::
13931::$$$message_0132_0107_0000$$$::The cauldron opens.[lr]::
13932::$$$message_0132_0107_0001$$$::Vicious fangs are all I see.[lr]::
13933::$$$message_0132_0107_0002$$$::There can be no resistance.[lr]::
13934::$$$message_0132_0107_0003$$$::Humans, which pale to insignificance before this, could never defend against it.[lr]::

13937::$$$message_0132_0108_0001$$$::It must be famished.[lr]::
13938::$$$message_0132_0108_0002$$$::It devours its prey, which would normally seem as inconsequential as motes of dust, with its bloodshot eyes.::
13939::$$$message_0132_0109_0000$$$::                              And I...am at a complete loss for words...::
13940::$$$message_0132_0110_0000$$$::   I wonder...[lr]::
13941::$$$message_0132_0110_0001$$$::Why do we not eat living meals?[lr]::
13942::$$$message_0132_0110_0002$$$::It's obvious.[lr]::
13943::$$$message_0132_0110_0003$$$::We cannot bear to see our food alive.[lr]::
13944::$$$message_0132_0110_0004$$$::We prefer fresh food, but rarely do we eat anything alive, because we feel it's cruel for our food to suffer.[lr]::
13945::$$$message_0132_0110_0005$$$::In other words...[lr]::
13946::$$$message_0132_0110_0006$$$::Killing the meat we consume before we eat it is our way of preserving its dignity.::
13947::$$$message_0132_0111_0000$$$::A scream of rage tears its way from my throat.[lr]::
13948::$$$message_0132_0111_0001$$$::I forget who I am and roar like a beast.[lr]::
13949::$$$message_0132_0111_0002$$$::I try to appeal to the beast. [flicker time=200 count=1][lr]::
13950::$$$message_0132_0111_0003$$$::The hatred builds within me.[lr]::
13951::$$$message_0132_0111_0004$$$::My only resistance is baring my emotions.[lr]::
13952::$$$message_0132_0111_0005$$$::I beg for mercy like a crucified sinner as I'm ground to meal.::
13953::$$$message_0132_0112_0000$$$::My consciousness grows hazy, muddled.[lr]::
13954::$$$message_0132_0112_0001$$$::Every purpose and meaning in my life falls away.[lr]::
13955::$$$message_0132_0112_0002$$$::Any hope of retaining my sanity is as long gone as creation itself.[lr]::
13956::$$$message_0132_0112_0003$$$::...[rf][lr]::
13957::$$$message_0132_0112_0004$$$::The pain, the pressure... They're far, far too much.[lr]::
13958::$$$message_0132_0112_0005$$$::And then...[lr]::
13959::$$$message_0132_0112_0006$$$::...when I came to see it only as a monster...::
13960::$$$message_0132_0113_0000$$$::Even once I'd learned of this hell...[lr]::
13961::$$$message_0132_0113_0001$$$::I believed I could endure it. The image of Saber, her head hanging low, comes back to me.::
13962::$$$message_0132_0114_0000$$$::...[lr]::
13963::$$$message_0132_0114_0001$$$::I recall the meaning of this pain.[lr]::
13964::$$$message_0132_0114_0002$$$::That meaning drives me forward.[lr]::
13965::$$$message_0132_0114_0003$$$::It is a literal painful reminder of what I came here to do.::
13966::$$$message_0132_0115_0000$$$::...[lr]::
13967::$$$message_0132_0115_0001$$$::I draw in a deep breath, and let go of my resistance.[lr]::
13968::$$$message_0132_0115_0002$$$::It's not the dragon's fangs I should be fighting, but the pain twisting through me.[lr]::
13969::$$$message_0132_0115_0003$$$::I'm not here to run from the pain.[lr]::
13970::$$$message_0132_0115_0004$$$::I'm here to save her pain...to live up to the trust she's placed in me time and time again.[lr]::
13971::$$$message_0132_0115_0005$$$::   And so...[lr]::
13972::$$$message_0132_0115_0006$$$::I'm here to give her the best thing that I, who has no hope of fighting, can give.::
13973::$$$message_0132_0116_0000$$$::The pain is indescribable.[lr]::
13974::$$$message_0132_0116_0001$$$::I can't reach out to my ground down consciousness.[lr]::
13975::$$$message_0132_0116_0002$$$::I hone my awareness like a blade, silently, as if I were asleep.[lr]::
13976::$$$message_0132_0116_0003$$$::Here, eternity is but an instant.[lr]::
13977::$$$message_0132_0116_0004$$$::As long as I can endure this pain, even for an instant, my consciousness will remain.[lr]::
13978::$$$message_0132_0116_0005$$$::All right...then...::
13979::$$$message_0132_0117_0000$$$::                                     I won't let myself feel an ounce of fear.[lr]::
13980::$$$message_0132_0117_0001$$$::                     I shall dedicate this pain to you, who will be the one to fight.::
13981::$$$message_0132_0118_0000$$$::   The pain instantly fades.[lr]::
13982::$$$message_0132_0118_0001$$$::The red dragon is gone, and my consciousness gradually floats back to the surface.[lr]::
13983::$$$message_0132_0118_0002$$$::Am I weightless because I lost something?[lr]::
13984::$$$message_0132_0118_0003$$$::As if I'm floating back up to the water's surface, I feel myself begin rising up, above the reactor.[lr]::
13985::$$$message_0132_0118_0004$$$::But wait...[lr]::
13986::$$$message_0132_0118_0005$$$::There's something I want to check before...::
13987::$$$message_0132_0119_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
13988::$$$message_0132_0119_0001$$$::It's so warm.[lr]::
13989::$$$message_0132_0119_0002$$$::A dull, throbbing hum issues from the reactor as it burns with golden light.[lr]::
13990::$$$message_0132_0119_0003$$$::The elaborate Magic Circuits shine with a rainbow hue, and begin their circulation.[lr]::
13991::$$$message_0132_0119_0004$$$::The fire is lit.[lr]::
13992::$$$message_0132_0119_0005$$$::I may be an untrained amateur of a mage, but today I've filled my role as her lord.::
13993::$$$message_0132_0120_0000$$$::I surrender my body to the wind and float upward.[lr]::
13994::$$$message_0132_0120_0001$$$::I catch a glimpse of a distant memory.[lr]::
13995::$$$message_0132_0120_0002$$$::A figure holding a sword, and a figure standing in a grassy field as it dances in the wind.[lr]::
13996::$$$message_0132_0120_0003$$$::Which one did I find reminiscent?[line len=4]::
13997::$$$message_0132_0121_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
13998::$$$message_0132_0121_0001$$$::I feel sunlight on my eyelids, and slowly open them.::
13999::$$$message_0132_0122_0000$$$::...[lr]::
14000::$$$message_0132_0122_0001$$$::Dazed and confused, I check over my own body.[lr]::
14001::$$$message_0132_0122_0002$$$::My arms and legs are fine. I don't see any wounds.[lr]::
14002::$$$message_0132_0122_0003$$$::Maybe the pain faded the moment I was able to endure it.[lr]::
14003::$$$message_0132_0122_0004$$$::My physical wounds, and even the mental scars seem to have been healed.::
14004::$$$message_0132_0123_0000$$$::"...Oh...Shirou."[lr]::
14005::$$$message_0132_0123_0001$$$::I hear a weak voice from under me.[lr]::
14006::$$$message_0132_0123_0002$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
14007::$$$message_0132_0123_0003$$$::The feeling of her soft skin immediately makes me realize who's speaking, and the position we're in.::
14008::$$$message_0132_0124_0000$$$::"Ah...! [shock time=300 vmax=30 count=-2]Ouch!"[lr]::
14009::$$$message_0132_0124_0001$$$::Saber is lying on the bed with her blouse in disarray, while Tohsaka is sleeping, cradling her knees to her chest.[lr]::
14010::$$$message_0132_0124_0002$$$::Tohsaka may be fine, but Saber's been under me like this...the whole time.::
14011::$$$message_0132_0125_0000$$$::"M-morning, Saber."[lr]::
14012::$$$message_0132_0125_0001$$$::"Yes. Good morning, Shirou."::
14013::$$$message_0132_0126_0000$$$::We exchange awkward pleasantries.[lr]::
14014::$$$message_0132_0126_0001$$$::Saber slowly gets up and rearranges her blouse.[lr]::
14015::$$$message_0132_0126_0002$$$::Crap. We're so embarrassed, we can't look each other in the eye.::
14016::$$$message_0132_0127_0000$$$::"Y-you can already get up, Saber?"[lr]::
14017::$$$message_0132_0127_0001$$$::"Yes. I can receive your supply of magical energy now."[lr]::
14018::$$$message_0132_0127_0002$$$::...She seems to be back to her normal self.[lr]::
14019::$$$message_0132_0127_0003$$$::When I carried her here last night, she was so weak, it seemed she might disappear at any moment. But that weakness is gone now.::
14020::$$$message_0132_0128_0000$$$::"I see. That's a relief. So the Magic Circuit transplant worked."[lr]::
14021::$$$message_0132_0128_0001$$$::"Yes. So, um...would you please put your clothes on, Shirou? I do not know why, but it is difficult speaking to you this way."::
14022::$$$message_0132_0129_0000$$$::I look down at myself.[lr]::
14023::$$$message_0132_0129_0001$$$::"Oh...right. Yeah...you're right!"[lr]::
14024::$$$message_0132_0129_0002$$$::I hastily reach for my neatly folded shirt.[lr]::
14025::$$$message_0132_0129_0003$$$::That was nice of Tohsaka to fold it up like that... Wait, no! I did that![lr]::
14026::$$$message_0132_0129_0004$$$::Why did I fold it so tight...?::
14027::$$$message_0132_0130_0000$$$::"...Argh."[lr]::
14028::$$$message_0132_0130_0001$$$::I vividly recall last night's ritual.[lr]::
14029::$$$message_0132_0130_0002$$$::I connected with Saber, and Tohsaka transplanted my Magic Circuits deep within Saber.[lr]::
14030::$$$message_0132_0130_0003$$$::Saber looks like she's back to normal, but what happened to me?::
14031::$$$message_0132_0131_0000$$$::...[lr]::
14032::$$$message_0132_0131_0001$$$::Tohsaka warned that my body and mind may not be able to handle the loss of Magic Circuits, but I don't feel much damage, nor any huge sense of loss.[lr]::
14033::$$$message_0132_0131_0002$$$::I was a little scared, but I checked on my Magic Circuits myself.[lr]::
14034::$$$message_0132_0131_0003$$$::The idea of seeing for myself just how much I've lost is terrifying, but we're heading into battle against Berserker.[lr]::
14035::$$$message_0132_0131_0004$$$::I need to understand my own condition.::
14036::$$$message_0132_0132_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
14037::$$$message_0132_0132_0001$$$::I don't know how to explain it.[lr]::
14038::$$$message_0132_0132_0002$$$::The overall function of my Magic Circuits feels sluggish, but there doesn't seem to be any obvious damage.[lr]::
14039::$$$message_0132_0132_0003$$$::I was chewed to pieces, but my Magic Circuits are still intact.[lr]::
14040::$$$message_0132_0132_0004$$$::It looks like I'll still be able to do my Strengthening magecraft.::
14041::$$$message_0132_0133_0000$$$::"I see. So that means..."[lr]::
14042::$$$message_0132_0133_0001$$$::I assume the Magic Circuits I rarely use were the ones Tohsaka took.[lr]::
14043::$$$message_0132_0133_0002$$$::I only activate about one to four circuits when I do Strengthening. Since I can't do large-scale magecraft anyway, I've never fully activated all my circuits.[lr]::
14044::$$$message_0132_0133_0003$$$::So she transplanted the circuits I don't use to Saber.::
14045::$$$message_0132_0134_0000$$$::"...Shirou?"[lr]::
14046::$$$message_0132_0134_0001$$$::I close my eyes to assess my situation.[lr]::
14047::$$$message_0132_0134_0002$$$::It seems this won't affect my Strengthening magecraft.[lr]::
14048::$$$message_0132_0134_0003$$$::But this sluggishness, like I'm wading through water, is because my capacity for magecraft has decreased.::
14049::$$$message_0132_0135_0000$$$::In exchange, though, I feel that I'm connected to something important deep inside myself.[lr]::
14050::$$$message_0132_0135_0001$$$::I can't tell exactly where it's coming from, but there's a faint line that connects me and Saber.[lr]::
14051::$$$message_0132_0135_0002$$$::I've gained something truly important in exchange for my lost circuits.::
14052::$$$message_0132_0136_0000$$$::"I must apologize, Shirou."[lr]::
14053::$$$message_0132_0136_0001$$$::Saber speaks up from somewhere behind me.::
14054::$$$message_0132_0137_0000$$$::"I did my best to take as few of your circuits as possible.[lr]::
14055::$$$message_0132_0137_0001$$$::But even that bare minimum was too much to take from any one person. I have left a scar on you that will never fade, and I cannot apologize enough for that.[lr]::
14056::$$$message_0132_0137_0002$$$::It is my failure. If only I were stronger, more disciplined, I would not have[line2]"::
14057::$$$message_0132_0138_0000$$$::"That's not true. You have nothing to apologize for, Saber.[lr]::
14058::$$$message_0132_0138_0001$$$::This all happened because I couldn't supply you with magical energy in the first place.[lr]::
14059::$$$message_0132_0138_0002$$$::That's solved now, though. Now, I can give you the magical energy you need without a problem.[lr]::
14060::$$$message_0132_0138_0003$$$::Yep. Now I can finally, proudly say that I am Saber's Master."::
14061::$$$message_0132_0139_0000$$$::"But Shirou..."[lr]::
14062::$$$message_0132_0139_0001$$$::"Don't worry about my Magic Circuits. I didn't use them all anyway; I even feel better without them, actually."::
14063::$$$message_0132_0140_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
14064::$$$message_0132_0140_0001$$$::Saber's expression remains clouded.[lr]::
14065::$$$message_0132_0140_0002$$$::Crap. I never know what to say at times like this.::
14066::$$$message_0132_0141_0000$$$::Saber's recovered, and I survived even after the loss of some of my Magic Circuits…[lr]::
14067::$$$message_0132_0141_0001$$$::Saber's Magic Circuits...the dream of light and wind and Saber in her youth. And on top of that, we spent the night touching, skin to skin…::
14068::$$$message_0132_0142_0000$$$::...[lr]::
14069::$$$message_0132_0142_0001$$$::Calm down, calm down.[lr]::
14070::$$$message_0132_0142_0002$$$::That was a ritual for our survival.[lr]::
14071::$$$message_0132_0142_0003$$$::I need to calm my mind. If I don't focus, I could mess up during battle.::
14072::$$$message_0132_0143_0000$$$::"...Hnnn? "[lr]::
14073::$$$message_0132_0143_0001$$$::The sleepy rhythm of Tohsaka's breathing halts, and she grunts.[lr]::
14074::$$$message_0132_0143_0002$$$::Looks like Tohsaka's awake too.::
14075::$$$message_0132_0144_0000$$$::"G-good morning, Rin."[lr]::
14076::$$$message_0132_0144_0001$$$::"Y-yo. Morning, Tohsaka."::
14077::$$$message_0132_0145_0000$$$::I see Tohsaka's hair shift, then her head tilts up.[lr]::
14078::$$$message_0132_0145_0001$$$::She is not a morning person at all, and doesn't look her usual sharp self. At all.::
14079::$$$message_0132_0146_0000$$$::"Thanks, Tohsaka. It worked."[lr]::
14080::$$$message_0132_0146_0001$$$::"Yes. He is able to supply me with magical energy now. But in exchange, Shirou has..."[lr]::
14081::$$$message_0132_0146_0002$$$::"No, I only lost about thirty percent, so don't worry. I can make do with what I still have."::
14082::$$$message_0132_0147_0000$$$::"Th-thirty percent!?[lr]::
14083::$$$message_0132_0147_0001$$$::I did everything I could to minimize what I took, but I still took thirty percent...[chgfg textoff=0 time=300 storage=セイバー私服20b(中)] I cannot believe my own greed..."[lr]::
14084::$$$message_0132_0147_0002$$$::"Greedy, you say? I know you were hungry, but I wish you'd had a little better manners."[lr]::
14085::$$$message_0132_0147_0003$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"::
14086::$$$message_0132_0148_0000$$$::Tohsaka joining us helps dispel the awkwardness between Saber and me.[lr]::

14088::$$$message_0132_0148_0002$$$::"Is that so? Then...let's get going."[lr]::
14089::$$$message_0132_0148_0003$$$::Tohsaka yawns and gets to her feet.::
14090::$$$message_0132_0149_0000$$$::It's almost time for the battle.[lr]::
14091::$$$message_0132_0149_0001$$$::Somewhere in that forest, Berserker and Illyasviel await.[lr]::
14092::$$$message_0132_0149_0002$$$::If we don't defeat that hurricane of death, everything we did last night was for nothing.[lr]::
14093::$$$message_0132_0149_0003$$$::The connection that was created between me and Saber, deep in our hearts...[lr]::
14094::$$$message_0132_0149_0004$$$::To protect what we created, we'll have to defeat the most powerful enemy of all...::
