61707::$$$message_0564_0000_0000$$$::Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
61708::$$$message_0564_0000_0001$$$::Now a barren place since Caster's demise.[lr]::
61709::$$$message_0564_0000_0002$$$::The monks who collapsed due to an unknown illness all left the mountain, leaving the temple completely uninhabited.[lr]::
61710::$$$message_0564_0000_0003$$$::The gates are tightly shut to even residents of the temple, to say nothing of visitors.::
61711::$$$message_0564_0001_0000$$$::"Tch. It reeks something awful. No one told me anything about the stench."[lr]::
61712::$$$message_0564_0001_0001$$$::A voice echoes in the empty temple grounds.[lr]::
61713::$$$message_0564_0001_0002$$$::His lithe blue form is illuminated by the moonlight.[lr]::
61714::$$$message_0564_0001_0003$$$::The muscular body without a gram of excess, and the long scarlet weapon belong to the Servant called Lancer.::
61715::$$$message_0564_0002_0000$$$::"Well, well. The Bounded Field's still up even after its owner kicked the bucket.[lr]::
61716::$$$message_0564_0002_0001$$$::...No, its repulsiveness has increased by half compared to before. Caster's work was impressive, compared to this."::
61717::$$$message_0564_0003_0000$$$::Lancer casually peers out over the temple grounds.[lr]::
61718::$$$message_0564_0003_0001$$$::He grips his crimson spear.[lr]::
61719::$$$message_0564_0003_0002$$$::Intelligence-gathering and observation are his primary tasks.[lr]::
61720::$$$message_0564_0003_0003$$$::He isn't happy about it, but orders are orders.[lr]::
61721::$$$message_0564_0003_0004$$$::It's his policy to follow his lord's commands and deliver the results asked of him.[lr]::
61722::$$$message_0564_0003_0005$$$::Accordingly, he's skirmished with several Servants so far and disengaged each time.::
61723::$$$message_0564_0004_0000$$$::Lancer hasn't fought any battles on his own initiative, per his contract with his Master.[lr]::
61724::$$$message_0564_0004_0001$$$::Tonight's scouting mission to Ryudou Temple is no exception.[lr]::
61725::$$$message_0564_0004_0002$$$::So, he shouldn't need his spear.[lr]::
61726::$$$message_0564_0004_0003$$$::He can conjure his Noble Phantasm any time he wishes.[lr]::
61727::$$$message_0564_0004_0004$$$::One would think it unnecessary to be armed when there's no enemy to fight.::
61728::$$$message_0564_0005_0000$$$::"All this damn chirping. I figured Caster for a wind-user, but maybe she used water, too. This place is crawling with spiders and leeches and so on."::
61729::$$$message_0564_0006_0000$$$::He walks through the temple grounds.[lr]::
61730::$$$message_0564_0006_0001$$$::His manner appears utterly defenseless and unbecoming of a Servant.[lr]::
61731::$$$message_0564_0006_0002$$$::So unguarded is he that on the off chance another Servant is lurking nearby, he would surely perish in an ambush.::
61732::$$$message_0564_0007_0000$$$::"Yeah I suppose, someone might have switched heads with her.[lr]::
61733::$$$message_0564_0007_0001$$$::There's nothing but rotten bugs here. Building a nest in someone's abandoned house is par for the course for you lot."::
61734::$$$message_0564_0008_0000$$$::Lancer's foul mood doesn't lift.[lr]::
61735::$$$message_0564_0008_0001$$$::The blue-clad spearman admonishes someone who isn't present.::
61736::$$$message_0564_0009_0000$$$::"There was one big one, though.[lr]::
61737::$$$message_0564_0009_0001$$$::I don't know where it's from, but it was living amongst the mountain beasts. Plus, is that...sand I smell?[lr]::
61738::$$$message_0564_0009_0002$$$::Ha. Here I was imagining some giant spider, when it was just a filthy sand worm.[lr]::
61739::$$$message_0564_0009_0003$$$::Gods be damned, why do I have to track this gloomy bastard!?"::
61740::$$$message_0564_0010_0000$$$::    He bats aside a silver flash of light.[lr]::
61741::$$$message_0564_0010_0001$$$::With a single flourish of his spear, Lancer deflects three deadly darts from the darkness.::
61742::$$$message_0564_0011_0000$$$::The wicked daggers plunge into the ground.[lr]::
61743::$$$message_0564_0011_0001$$$::They are dirks: short knives made not for slicing, but skewering their unlucky target.[lr]::
61744::$$$message_0564_0011_0002$$$::Each was hurled with unerring accuracy at Lancer's two eyes and windpipe, respectively.::
61745::$$$message_0564_0012_0000$$$::"Nice throw. But don't bother trying again, sand worm.[lr]::
61746::$$$message_0564_0012_0001$$$::It isn't my style to lose my life without even an introduction first. Though, it's yours that's ripe for the taking."::
61747::$$$message_0564_0013_0000$$$::The muscled blue form faces the darkness.[lr]::
61748::$$$message_0564_0013_0001$$$::Something faintly shifts in the gloom of the shrine.[lr]::
61749::$$$message_0564_0013_0002$$$::A skull laughs, its bony facade as white as the moon.::
61750::$$$message_0564_0014_0000$$$::    The battle commences without preamble.[lr]::
61751::$$$message_0564_0014_0001$$$::The white skull shrieks in no human tongue as it attacks Lancer,[lr]::
61752::$$$message_0564_0014_0002$$$::who meets its ambush without so much as twitching an eyebrow.::
61753::$$$message_0564_0015_0000$$$::The skull's thrown dirks are on par with Archer's arrows.[lr]::
61754::$$$message_0564_0015_0001$$$::Thirty in total are loosed from the darkness at very close range.[lr]::
61755::$$$message_0564_0015_0002$$$::And Lancer parries every single one effortlessly.::
61756::$$$message_0564_0016_0000$$$::"Hee?"[lr]::
61757::$$$message_0564_0016_0001$$$::The skull halts.[lr]::
61758::$$$message_0564_0016_0002$$$::That's strange.[lr]::
61759::$$$message_0564_0016_0003$$$::No matter how capable a spearman Lancer is, he surely can't have blocked every single one of the skull's daggers, each aimed precisely enough to thread a needle.[lr]::
61760::$$$message_0564_0016_0004$$$::Moreover, his opponent wields a polearm.[lr]::
61761::$$$message_0564_0016_0005$$$::The dirks were aimed at the spear's blind angles and should have struck his opponent's vital points, so how could Lancer have defeated every last one?::
61762::$$$message_0564_0017_0000$$$::"Hey. Don't tell me that's all there is to your tricks."[lr]::
61763::$$$message_0564_0017_0001$$$::Lancer's demeanor changes.[lr]::
61764::$$$message_0564_0017_0002$$$::He stops, and his merely curious hostility shifts to a determined intent to kill the skull.::
61765::$$$message_0564_0018_0000$$$::"If so, you're finished.[lr]::
61766::$$$message_0564_0018_0001$$$::I don't know who the hell you are...but I can just tear off that mask to find out."::
61767::$$$message_0564_0019_0000$$$::   More daggers surge out of the darkness.[lr]::
61768::$$$message_0564_0019_0001$$$::Just as Lancer is about to advance on the skull, he's intercepted by a frenzied barrage!::
61769::$$$message_0564_0020_0000$$$::And that too, is thwarted.[lr]::
61770::$$$message_0564_0020_0001$$$::With only a subtle movement of his spear, Lancer nullifies attacks he shouldn't even be able to see.::
61771::$$$message_0564_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
61772::$$$message_0564_0021_0001$$$::The skull mask trembles.[lr]::
61773::$$$message_0564_0021_0002$$$::It doesn't speak, but it gulps down its next shriek, staring in disbelief at the enemy coming for its head.[lr]::
61774::$$$message_0564_0021_0003$$$::"Hah, heee!"[lr]::
61775::$$$message_0564_0021_0004$$$::It aims another dagger for Lancer's throat between a gap in his spear's movements!::
61776::$$$message_0564_0022_0000$$$::"Hee...!"[lr]::
61777::$$$message_0564_0022_0001$$$::The skull mask trembles.[lr]::
61778::$$$message_0564_0022_0002$$$::As Lancer's spear deflects the daggers, it spins in a neat circle in Lancer's hands, arching up into the attacking skull's jaw.::
61779::$$$message_0564_0023_0000$$$::Defense and riposte.[lr]::
61780::$$$message_0564_0023_0001$$$::Both maneuvers executed perfectly simultaneously.[lr]::
61781::$$$message_0564_0023_0002$$$::The skull has no way of defending itself in midflight.::
61782::$$$message_0564_0024_0000$$$::    The white mask falls.[lr]::
61783::$$$message_0564_0024_0001$$$::Lancer doesn't press the attack.[lr]::
61784::$$$message_0564_0024_0002$$$::His orders are to merely observe the enemy.[lr]::
61785::$$$message_0564_0024_0003$$$::Even if this is a golden opportunity to execute his opponent, he lacks the authority to make that decision.::
61786::$$$message_0564_0025_0000$$$::"I told you, fool. Projectiles won't work on me. Blame yourself for ignoring my warning."::
61787::$$$message_0564_0026_0000$$$::Lancer reorients his spear toward his enemy which is hiding its face and calmly watches.[lr]::
61788::$$$message_0564_0026_0001$$$::A dark body.[lr]::
61789::$$$message_0564_0026_0002$$$::A right arm contained in bandages.[lr]::
61790::$$$message_0564_0026_0003$$$::Its face, once concealed by a white skull mask, is now shrouded in darkness and difficult to make out clearly.::
61791::$$$message_0564_0027_0000$$$::No...[lr]::
61792::$$$message_0564_0027_0001$$$::It would be closer to call it featureless, lacking obvious protrusions or depressions.::
61793::$$$message_0564_0028_0000$$$::"GeEEe... YoU Saw. MY fAce. LAnCER."[lr]::
61794::$$$message_0564_0028_0001$$$::"Oh, I'm going to get a good look. You're a Servant, no doubt. Now I'll figure out where you're from."[lr]::
61795::$$$message_0564_0028_0002$$$::"HeH. i sEE. soMEtHiNg bindS YoUr POWEr. No wOnDER. YOu faiL TO kiLL ME."::
61796::$$$message_0564_0029_0000$$$::The Servant retreats, cloaked in shadow.[lr]::
61797::$$$message_0564_0029_0001$$$::A dirk is clutched in its hand, its lethal intent towards Lancer undiminished.::
61798::$$$message_0564_0030_0000$$$::"Give it a rest. I just happened to be born this way. Projectiles from an opponent I can see don't work on me. Unless you've got a strong Noble Phantasm up your sleeve, you won't be able to hurt me throwing weapons from that distance."[lr]::
61799::$$$message_0564_0030_0001$$$::"! Ah, YOu HAve A bleSSInG thaT WARds OfF ARROWS. hEH, YOu mUST Be A GReAT hERo, UNliKe ME."::
61800::$$$message_0564_0031_0000$$$::Shadows sway.[lr]::
61801::$$$message_0564_0031_0001$$$::The dark Servant crouches down low like a spider,[lr]::
61802::$$$message_0564_0031_0002$$$::then suddenly flings another dagger while leaping high into the air.::
61803::$$$message_0564_0032_0000$$$::If its high leap can be compared to that of a deer, then one might compare its frantic scurrying to that of a spider, snake, or scorpion.[lr]::
61804::$$$message_0564_0032_0001$$$::The Servant flees, hiding its face. The speed of its flight is on par with Lancer.[lr]::
61805::$$$message_0564_0032_0002$$$::But Lancer's explosive bursts of agility are without peer.[lr]::
61806::$$$message_0564_0032_0003$$$::It would be unthinkable for him to need more than a moment to close in on his prey.::
61807::$$$message_0564_0033_0000$$$::"Tch. I went for the throat, but you're a pesky one. You can't have healed, so you must just be insane."::
61808::$$$message_0564_0034_0000$$$::Lancer gives chase, his enemy skating on the wet surface like a water strider.[lr]::
61809::$$$message_0564_0034_0001$$$::His pursuit churns and splits the water in contrast with his target's elegant escape, but the water strider has no hope of outrunning him.::
61810::$$$message_0564_0035_0000$$$::"...Tsk. Should've crippled his joints if I'd known the pain would drive him into flight. That wouldn't have worked on any of the others, but now I have to clean up this mess."::
61811::$$$message_0564_0036_0000$$$::For a human, the severing of one's limbs or major arteries is a critical injury.[lr]::
61812::$$$message_0564_0036_0001$$$::A laceration to the aorta, for instance, would cause catastrophic blood loss, leading to certain death in combat.[lr]::
61813::$$$message_0564_0036_0002$$$::But this logic only applies to a conventional battle between mortals.[lr]::
61814::$$$message_0564_0036_0003$$$::It is unrealistic to expect a Servant[line2]a mighty Heroic Spirit[line2]to die of exsanguination.::
61815::$$$message_0564_0037_0000$$$::As they are powered not by blood, but magical energy, injuring a major blood vessel would only amount to less effective, secondary means of harm.[lr]::
61816::$$$message_0564_0037_0001$$$::It would be a different story if one were to cripple all four limbs, but no Servant is so easily immobilized.[lr]::
61817::$$$message_0564_0037_0002$$$::Any time wasted on less lethal, immobilizing wounds could expose the attacker to a lethal riposte.::
61818::$$$message_0564_0038_0000$$$::"...Now I get it. You're using some trick to suppress your pain, but that only tells me you have no way to heal yourself. I'll settle this in the next blow."[lr]::
61819::$$$message_0564_0038_0001$$$::Lancer crosses the body of water in a geysering gust.[lr]::
61820::$$$message_0564_0038_0002$$$::In two seconds, his prey will be in hand.[lr]::
61821::$$$message_0564_0038_0003$$$::In a flash, he moves to cleave the fleeing water strider from the left hip...![lr]::
61822::$$$message_0564_0038_0004$$$::"...!"[lr]::
61823::$$$message_0564_0038_0005$$$::Lancer immediately leaps in retreat.::
61824::$$$message_0564_0039_0000$$$::     The water's surface jumps.[lr]::
61825::$$$message_0564_0039_0001$$$::No, something in it bares its fangs.[lr]::
61826::$$$message_0564_0039_0002$$$::Dark, thin tendrils chase Lancer into the air.[lr]::
61827::$$$message_0564_0039_0003$$$::It's as if the water itself attacks him.[lr]::
61828::$$$message_0564_0039_0004$$$::The spectacle brings to mind ancient horrors lurking in the ocean depths.::
61829::$$$message_0564_0040_0000$$$::"This thing is..."[lr]::
61830::$$$message_0564_0040_0001$$$::Lancer has nowhere to run.[lr]::
61831::$$$message_0564_0040_0002$$$::He strikes the water with his spear and uses every rune he possesses to inscribe a Bounded Field into the lakebed, but it is easily consumed by his pursuer.::
61832::$$$message_0564_0041_0000$$$::Dark tentacles surround him, eating up his safe haven second by second.[lr]::
61833::$$$message_0564_0041_0001$$$::Activated fully in concert, his runes are powerful enough to defend against a greater Noble Phantasm, but they barely even manage to slow the thing down.[lr]::
61834::$$$message_0564_0041_0002$$$::Assassin cackles.[lr]::
61835::$$$message_0564_0041_0003$$$::"wHat's WRoNg, lANCEr? It'Ll DevOur yoU uNless YOU MoVE."[lr]::
61836::$$$message_0564_0041_0004$$$::The water strider floats on the water, reveling in the sight.::
61837::$$$message_0564_0042_0000$$$::But it too is no exception from the tentacles' hunger.[lr]::
61838::$$$message_0564_0042_0001$$$::It doesn't dare approach the blackened water for fear of being consumed.[lr]::
61839::$$$message_0564_0042_0002$$$::It knows that the dark tentacles will instantly shift its attention to any new prey.::
61840::$$$message_0564_0043_0000$$$::"BUT ThAT won'T Do. I MUsT BE The onE to kIlL YoU. I STiLL laCK eXPErience. Once I TAKE your Life, I wiLL gAIN THE KNOWlEdGe I lack."::
61841::$$$message_0564_0044_0000$$$::Light glints off the strider's dagger.[lr]::
61842::$$$message_0564_0044_0001$$$::It throws its dagger at the immobilized Lancer.[lr]::
61843::$$$message_0564_0044_0002$$$::Still, it is futile.[lr]::
61844::$$$message_0564_0044_0003$$$::Even while fully engaged with his bizarre foe, Lancer is immune to the projectile attack.::
61845::$$$message_0564_0045_0000$$$::"You still don't learn. I can see why you're so eager, though."[lr]::
61846::$$$message_0564_0045_0001$$$::Lancer observes the tentacles surrounding him.[lr]::
61847::$$$message_0564_0045_0002$$$::Assassin has lured him a considerable distance from shore. It's thirty meters to the nearest bank.[lr]::
61848::$$$message_0564_0045_0003$$$::He can easily cross that piddling distance in a single bound...!::
61849::$$$message_0564_0046_0000$$$::"as soOn aS yoU stopPED mOVINg. yoU LosT. i've waTchED Long EnoUGH. tImE to wrAP this UP."[lr]::
61850::$$$message_0564_0046_0001$$$::Lancer's body sinks, his spear warping.[lr]::
61851::$$$message_0564_0046_0002$$$::He takes a great leap into the air with the aid of his spear.[lr]::
61852::$$$message_0564_0046_0003$$$::But then...[lr]::
61853::$$$message_0564_0046_0004$$$::"What?"[lr]::
61854::$$$message_0564_0046_0005$$$::An utterly simple, straightforward attack is unleashed.::
61855::$$$message_0564_0047_0000$$$::A false heart emerges from Lancer's chest.[lr]::
61856::$$$message_0564_0047_0001$$$::From an impossible distance, still bobbing on the lake surface,[lr]::
61857::$$$message_0564_0047_0002$$$::Assassin gouges out the spearman's chest.::
61858::$$$message_0564_0048_0000$$$::It is one of the purest forms of magecraft, the most simplified of curses.[lr]::
61859::$$$message_0564_0048_0001$$$::A cursed arm specialized in cursing humans, passed down through Middle Eastern magecraft.[lr]::
61860::$$$message_0564_0048_0002$$$::    Assassin's Noble Phantasm: Zabaniya. Delusional Heartbeat.[lr]::
61861::$$$message_0564_0048_0003$$$::It destroys Lancer's heart without fail. The spearman's lifeless body sinks into the dark water.::
61862::$$$message_0564_0049_0000$$$::The water dances.[lr]::
61863::$$$message_0564_0049_0001$$$::It writhes in stimulation; restless, brutal, vulgar.[lr]::
61864::$$$message_0564_0049_0002$$$::The sight of a caged and starved beast thrown fresh meat would pale before this savagery.[lr]::
61865::$$$message_0564_0049_0003$$$::   Countless dark tentacle-like appendages consume the man-shaped Heroic Spirit.[lr]::
61866::$$$message_0564_0049_0004$$$::Floating on the black lake, the faceless Servant drinks something red in delight.::à
