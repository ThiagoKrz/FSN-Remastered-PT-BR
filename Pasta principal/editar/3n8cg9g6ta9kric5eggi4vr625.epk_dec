35332::$$$message_0289_0000_0000$$$::"Three... What's your reply, Emiya?"[lr]::
35333::$$$message_0289_0000_0001$$$::"AHHH!"[lr]::
35334::$$$message_0289_0000_0002$$$::We stare at each other.[lr]::
35335::$$$message_0289_0000_0003$$$::Did I just hear a scream coming from below...!?::
35336::$$$message_0289_0001_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, that was..."[lr]::
35337::$$$message_0289_0001_0001$$$::"...A scream, right?"[lr]::
35338::$$$message_0289_0001_0002$$$::I immediately stand up and start running.[lr]::
35339::$$$message_0289_0001_0003$$$::"Hey, do you know where it came from, Emiya...!?"[lr]::
35340::$$$message_0289_0001_0004$$$::"How would I know! I could only tell it came from below!"[lr]::
35341::$$$message_0289_0001_0005$$$::"Hold on, I'll lift the Bounded Field...!"::
35342::$$$message_0289_0002_0000$$$::I run down the stairs.[lr]::
35343::$$$message_0289_0002_0001$$$::"I said hold on! It's dangerous to go by yourself!"[lr]::
35344::$$$message_0289_0002_0002$$$::"This isn't the time to be worrying! That scream sounded bad!"::
35345::$$$message_0289_0003_0000$$$::"I know that! That's why I'm saying it's dangerous, stupid!"[lr]::
35346::$$$message_0289_0003_0001$$$::I go down to the first floor.[lr]::
35347::$$$message_0289_0003_0002$$$::At first glance, the hall looks empty.[lr]::
35348::$$$message_0289_0003_0003$$$::But then I spot a female student laying on the floor at the far end.::
35349::$$$message_0289_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]No![font italic=false][lr]::
35350::$$$message_0289_0004_0001$$$::The student is in a heap in front of the emergency exit.::
35351::$$$message_0289_0005_0000$$$::"...Good. She only passed out."[lr]::
35352::$$$message_0289_0005_0001$$$::I run to the student to check if she's okay.[lr]::
35353::$$$message_0289_0005_0002$$$::Is she a first year?[lr]::
35354::$$$message_0289_0005_0003$$$::She's unconscious, but I don't see any bleeding or wounds, so she seems all right.::
35355::$$$message_0289_0006_0000$$$::"It's more than that! She's so pale. Can't you tell that she's empty inside!?"[lr]::
35356::$$$message_0289_0006_0001$$$::"Huh...? Empty inside...?"::
35357::$$$message_0289_0007_0000$$$::"She's had her magical energy...her life force drained. It's as bad as[line2]no, worse than those attacked by Caster.[lr]::
35358::$$$message_0289_0007_0001$$$::   This girl is going to die if we leave her like this."[lr]::
35359::$$$message_0289_0007_0002$$$::"Wha... Die without a single wound...!?"::
35360::$$$message_0289_0008_0000$$$::"Even if there's no external wounds, it follows that she'd die if her life force is gone. She doesn't have enough bloodflow... Hold on, in this state, I might be able to do something with the stone I have..." ::
35361::$$$message_0289_0009_0000$$$::She rifles through her pockets.[lr]::
35362::$$$message_0289_0009_0001$$$::...Thank god.[lr]::
35363::$$$message_0289_0009_0002$$$::It seems serious, but Tohsaka seems to know how to cure her.::
35364::$$$message_0289_0010_0000$$$::She kneels over and treats the collapsed student. [lr]::
35365::$$$message_0289_0010_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
35366::$$$message_0289_0010_0002$$$::From her profile, she looks incredibly serious.[lr]::
35367::$$$message_0289_0010_0003$$$::She tends to the student, as sweat forms on her forehead.::
35368::$$$message_0289_0011_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
35369::$$$message_0289_0011_0001$$$::...What is it...[lr]::
35370::$$$message_0289_0011_0002$$$::It's...her expression is so laser-focused it pains me just to look at it.[lr]::
35371::$$$message_0289_0011_0003$$$::I feel like...it isn't the first time I've seen[line2]::
35372::$$$message_0289_0012_0000$$$::"Ugh, that's so annoying...! Emiya, can you close that door? My hair keeps flying into my face."[lr]::
35373::$$$message_0289_0012_0001$$$::"Huh... Oh, that emergency exit?"[lr]::
35374::$$$message_0289_0012_0002$$$::I look at the open door.::
35375::$$$message_0289_0013_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
35376::$$$message_0289_0013_0001$$$::Open...?[lr]::
35377::$$$message_0289_0013_0002$$$::Come to think of it, we haven't even discovered why the girl collapsed in the first place.[lr]::
35378::$$$message_0289_0013_0003$$$::It's not like she did this on her own. Someone obviously attacked her.[lr]::
35379::$$$message_0289_0013_0004$$$::It didn't even take us a minute to get here, so if the culprit fled, it had to be out this door.::
35380::$$$message_0289_0014_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
35381::$$$message_0289_0014_0001$$$::Is it because I was looking in that direction?[lr]::
35382::$$$message_0289_0014_0002$$$::I can just make out something dark flying in our direction[line2]::
35383::$$$message_0289_0014_0003$$$::"Watch out, Tohsaka!"[lr]::
35384::$$$message_0289_0014_0004$$$::I shield Tohsaka with my right arm.::
35385::$$$message_0289_0015_0000$$$::"Huh... W-what is that...! Emiya, y-your arm...!"[lr]::
35386::$$$message_0289_0015_0001$$$::"Hrrk...!"[lr]::
35387::$$$message_0289_0015_0002$$$::A shadowy dagger has pierced right through my arm.::
35388::$$$message_0289_0016_0000$$$::Protruding from between my elbow and wrist is something that resembles a nail.[lr]::
35389::$$$message_0289_0016_0001$$$::No, it's far too large to be just a nail.[lr]::
35390::$$$message_0289_0016_0002$$$::And whatever it is, it has completely skewered my forearm.::
35391::$$$message_0289_0017_0000$$$::"Why did you... I mean, y-you're bleeding so much, but it d-doesn't hurt...?"[lr]::
35392::$$$message_0289_0017_0001$$$::"...It hurts. It hurts like crazy."[lr]::
35393::$$$message_0289_0017_0002$$$::But it hurts so much that I can't panic.[lr]::
35394::$$$message_0289_0017_0003$$$::More importantly...[lr]::
35395::$$$message_0289_0017_0004$$$::It looks like this thing was aimed at Tohsaka's head.::
35396::$$$message_0289_0018_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka, take care of her."[lr]::
35397::$$$message_0289_0018_0001$$$::I get ready to run.[lr]::
35398::$$$message_0289_0018_0002$$$::There's no time to wait for her response.[lr]::
35399::$$$message_0289_0018_0003$$$::With my left hand, I adjust the grip on the metal pipe I'd Strengthened earlier and fly out the emergency exit.::
35400::$$$message_0289_0019_0000$$$::"Haah...haah haah haah..."[lr]::
35401::$$$message_0289_0019_0001$$$::My right arm dangles as I run.[lr]::
35402::$$$message_0289_0019_0002$$$::Everything below the elbow is red from blood.[lr]::
35403::$$$message_0289_0019_0003$$$::...Is it just bad luck with limbs for me today?[lr]::
35404::$$$message_0289_0019_0004$$$::Tohsaka tells me to hand over one hand with the Command Spells on it, and now my other hand is partially severed from the rest of me.::
35405::$$$message_0289_0020_0000$$$::"Ugh... It has to be around here."[lr]::
35406::$$$message_0289_0020_0001$$$::I look around.[lr]::
35407::$$$message_0289_0020_0002$$$::Though I don't know who or what did this, I can feel them drawing me out.[lr]::
35408::$$$message_0289_0020_0003$$$::Whoever attacked that female student...[lr]::
35409::$$$message_0289_0020_0004$$$::Whatever attacked Tohsaka with that dagger is nearby.[lr]::
35410::$$$message_0289_0020_0005$$$::I haven't lost them yet.[lr]::
35411::$$$message_0289_0020_0006$$$::If I close my eyes, I can feel the dark magical energy moving.::
35412::$$$message_0289_0021_0000$$$::"Behind the archery range... In the woods...!"[lr]::
35413::$$$message_0289_0021_0001$$$::I jump over the fence and run across mossy ground.[lr]::
35414::$$$message_0289_0021_0002$$$::    Then...[lr]::
35415::$$$message_0289_0021_0003$$$::Between the trees...[lr]::
35416::$$$message_0289_0021_0004$$$::Concealed amongst the thicket, a familiar face takes one look at me and laughs.::
35417::$$$message_0289_0022_0000$$$::"Shinji...?"[lr]::
35418::$$$message_0289_0022_0001$$$::I stop without thinking.[lr]::
35419::$$$message_0289_0022_0002$$$::Just what is he doing here?[lr]::
35420::$$$message_0289_0022_0003$$$::He's supposed to be missing. Wait, no...[lr]::
35421::$$$message_0289_0022_0004$$$::Mitsuzuri is the one that's missing, Shinji's the last one who saw her, and...::
35422::$$$message_0289_0023_0000$$$::"...Hrrk!!!!!"[lr]::
35423::$$$message_0289_0023_0001$$$::My injured arm throbs.[lr]::
35424::$$$message_0289_0023_0002$$$::The moment I'm about to fall forward...[lr]::
35425::$$$message_0289_0023_0003$$$::A nail-like dagger is thrust at my throat.::
35426::$$$message_0289_0024_0000$$$::"Hnng...!"[lr]::
35427::$$$message_0289_0024_0001$$$::I manage to dodge.[lr]::
35428::$$$message_0289_0024_0002$$$::Instead of going backwards or sideways, I follow my tumbling body and roll forward to avoid the blow.::
35429::$$$message_0289_0025_0000$$$::"Hnng... Guh...!!!"[lr]::
35430::$$$message_0289_0025_0001$$$::My throat.[lr]::
35431::$$$message_0289_0025_0002$$$::It scraped my throat. My skin's cut.[lr]::
35432::$$$message_0289_0025_0003$$$::Even then, I'm lucky.[lr]::
35433::$$$message_0289_0025_0004$$$::If I had been any slower, it would've cut through bone and sinew. ::
35434::$$$message_0289_0026_0000$$$::"You...!"[lr]::
35435::$$$message_0289_0026_0001$$$::I scramble up.[lr]::
35436::$$$message_0289_0026_0002$$$::In front of me...[lr]::
35437::$$$message_0289_0026_0003$$$::Stands a smiling woman clothed in black.::
35438::$$$message_0289_0027_0000$$$::"A Servant...!"[lr]::
35439::$$$message_0289_0027_0001$$$::I don't even have to check.[lr]::
35440::$$$message_0289_0027_0002$$$::A concentration of magical energy far beyond that of a human. Not even Tohsaka compares.[lr]::
35441::$$$message_0289_0027_0003$$$::I don't know what class she is, but her spiritual presence is greater than a human, without a doubt[line2]::
35442::$$$message_0289_0028_0000$$$::"She disappeared...!?"[lr]::
35443::$$$message_0289_0028_0001$$$::The shadow vanishes from my vision.[lr]::
35444::$$$message_0289_0028_0002$$$::    Instinctively, I can feel death's swift approach.[lr]::
35445::$$$message_0289_0028_0003$$$::I desperately swing my weapon above my head.::
35446::$$$message_0289_0029_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
35447::$$$message_0289_0029_0001$$$::The rod is able to repel the nail coming at my head from above.[lr]::
35448::$$$message_0289_0029_0002$$$::I don't know if she's somehow related to a spider or something, but she's leaping and clinging to the trees like one.::
35449::$$$message_0289_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
35450::$$$message_0289_0030_0001$$$::I run.[lr]::
35451::$$$message_0289_0030_0002$$$::It must've been chance that I was able to block that.[lr]::
35452::$$$message_0289_0030_0003$$$::There's no way I'll be able to dodge another, and fleeing is out of the question.::
35453::$$$message_0289_0031_0000$$$::"Ungh, haah...!"[lr]::
35454::$$$message_0289_0031_0001$$$::I make it to a nearby tree and put it to my back.[lr]::
35455::$$$message_0289_0031_0002$$$::That's one direction that I should be safe from. Or so I have to believe if I have any chance at this.::
35456::$$$message_0289_0032_0000$$$::"Damn it... Even though she's wearing something that stands out that much, why can't I..."[lr]::
35457::$$$message_0289_0032_0001$$$::I don't see the Servant in black anywhere.[lr]::
35458::$$$message_0289_0032_0002$$$::She might be jumping from branch to branch, since she hasn't come down to the ground at all.::
35459::$$$message_0289_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
35460::$$$message_0289_0033_0001$$$::Sweat rolls down my forehead.[lr]::
35461::$$$message_0289_0033_0002$$$::I can hear the sound of jangling chains. It's like the rattle of a snake ready to strike.::
35462::$$$message_0289_0034_0000$$$::"Ha... Haha..."[lr]::
35463::$$$message_0289_0034_0001$$$::Under the tree, I try my best to suppress mirthless laughter.[lr]::
35464::$$$message_0289_0034_0002$$$::The sound of chains echo through the woods.[lr]::
35465::$$$message_0289_0034_0003$$$::In this life-and-death situation where the next attack is sure to kill me, my mind is blank.[lr]::
35466::$$$message_0289_0034_0004$$$::I have no sense of time. The guillotine just hangs in the air.::
35467::$$$message_0289_0035_0000$$$::"Ha... Ha ha."[lr]::
35468::$$$message_0289_0035_0001$$$::That's what's strange.[lr]::
35469::$$$message_0289_0035_0002$$$::The battle should be over by now.::
35470::$$$message_0289_0036_0000$$$::But I'm still alive.[lr]::
35471::$$$message_0289_0036_0001$$$::How strange... Maybe that last attack killed me and my mind is now blank from wanting to believe that my fear of a surprise attack is actually a posthumous dream.::
35472::$$$message_0289_0037_0000$$$::"...Saber."[lr]::
35473::$$$message_0289_0037_0001$$$::...I can't compete against a Servant by myself.[lr]::
35474::$$$message_0289_0037_0002$$$::Then I'll have to rely on her.[lr]::
35475::$$$message_0289_0037_0003$$$::Command Spells. If I use a Command Spell and call Saber, I should be able to get out of this predicament.::
35476::$$$message_0289_0038_0000$$$::But...can I?[lr]::
35477::$$$message_0289_0038_0001$$$::I'm the one who got myself into this death trap. Then, I should be the one to handle it. And most of all...::
35478::$$$message_0289_0039_0000$$$::"...I haven't exhausted all of my options."[lr]::
35479::$$$message_0289_0039_0001$$$::That's right.[lr]::
35480::$$$message_0289_0039_0002$$$::I have a weapon in my hand, even if it's a shoddy one.[lr]::
35481::$$$message_0289_0039_0003$$$::And I can still move.[lr]::
35482::$$$message_0289_0039_0004$$$::If the location is bad, I can just move.[lr]::
35483::$$$message_0289_0039_0005$$$::I can call for Saber after that[line2]::
35484::$$$message_0289_0040_0000$$$::"I'm surprised. You're not using your Command Spell?"[lr]::
35485::$$$message_0289_0040_0001$$$::"...!"[lr]::
35486::$$$message_0289_0040_0002$$$::The voice echoes.[lr]::
35487::$$$message_0289_0040_0003$$$::Above... So she was hiding up in the tree.::
35488::$$$message_0289_0041_0000$$$::"...Heh. Unfortunately, I don't have that many left. If I use one over something like this, I don't know what I'd do moving forward."[lr]::
35489::$$$message_0289_0041_0001$$$::And well, to be honest, I don't really know how to use it either.::
35490::$$$message_0289_0042_0000$$$::"...I see. You must be brave, unlike my Master."[lr]::
35491::$$$message_0289_0042_0001$$$::I search for her exact location.[lr]::
35492::$$$message_0289_0042_0002$$$::Where is her voice coming from...?::
35493::$$$message_0289_0043_0000$$$::"Then, I shall also change my strategy. I cannot go all out against a Master without a Servant... I shall gently kill you."[lr]::
35494::$$$message_0289_0043_0001$$$::...The voice goes silent.[lr]::
35495::$$$message_0289_0043_0002$$$::Only the sound of chains echoes through the woods.::
35496::$$$message_0289_0044_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
35497::$$$message_0289_0044_0001$$$::...She's coming.[lr]::
35498::$$$message_0289_0044_0002$$$::What I have to do is get out of these woods.[lr]::
35499::$$$message_0289_0044_0003$$$::But to do so, I would have to block this Servant's nail weapon multiple times.::
35500::$$$message_0289_0045_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
35501::$$$message_0289_0045_0001$$$::The fact that I only have the leg of a chair that I Strengthened to defend myself is so pathetic that it's funny.[lr]::
35502::$$$message_0289_0045_0002$$$::If at least...[lr]::
35503::$$$message_0289_0045_0003$$$::If only this thing was impressive like his blades, then I could not only block but even counterattack...::
35504::$$$message_0289_0046_0000$$$::"...[r]::
35505::$$$message_0289_0046_0001$$$::...[r]::
35506::$$$message_0289_0046_0002$$$::                  [say storage=rin0509_shi_0300]Let's go."[lr]::
35507::$$$message_0289_0046_0003$$$::...I don't have the time to be thinking about what-ifs.[lr]::
35508::$$$message_0289_0046_0004$$$::It's about thirty meters to get out of the woods.[lr]::
35509::$$$message_0289_0046_0005$$$::This isn't much compared to the chase I had with Tohsaka...!::
35510::$$$message_0289_0047_0000$$$::    I run.[lr]::
35511::$$$message_0289_0047_0001$$$::I ignore the harsh sound of chains and run frantically towards the exit...!::
35512::$$$message_0289_0048_0000$$$::"Hup...!"[lr]::
35513::$$$message_0289_0048_0001$$$::I repel the attack from above.[lr]::
35514::$$$message_0289_0048_0002$$$::Then I block the roundhouse kick from the Servant that landed on the ground to my left.[lr]::
35515::$$$message_0289_0048_0003$$$::She's in front of me now.[lr]::
35516::$$$message_0289_0048_0004$$$::I think she's getting irritated from having her blows blocked, but I manage to deflect another onslaught...!::
35517::$$$message_0289_0049_0000$$$::"Ugh... This just isn't...!?"[lr]::
35518::$$$message_0289_0049_0001$$$::The Servant in black retreats.::

35520::$$$message_0289_0050_0001$$$::It's just chance.[lr]::
35521::$$$message_0289_0050_0002$$$::Just like the first attack, blocking everything else has been because of fortunate happenstance.[lr]::
35522::$$$message_0289_0050_0003$$$::I can't even see the enemy.[lr]::
35523::$$$message_0289_0050_0004$$$::For someone like that to be able to survive, it is nothing but pure luck.::
35524::$$$message_0289_0051_0000$$$::    But...[lr]::
35525::$$$message_0289_0051_0001$$$::Is it really [font italic=true]that[font italic=false] common?[lr]::
35526::$$$message_0289_0051_0002$$$::No, what if my assumptions were wrong in the first place?[lr]::
35527::$$$message_0289_0051_0003$$$::The first attack.[lr]::
35528::$$$message_0289_0051_0004$$$::A surprise attack to my head.[lr]::
35529::$$$message_0289_0051_0005$$$::Such attacks that would be impossible for Shirou Emiya to dodge...[lr]::
35530::$$$message_0289_0051_0006$$$::There's no way that coincidence is lining up this much...::
35531::$$$message_0289_0052_0000$$$::"...You..."[lr]::
35532::$$$message_0289_0052_0001$$$::The Servant in black mutters to herself.[lr]::
35533::$$$message_0289_0052_0002$$$::A surprisingly beautiful, sensual voice, despite the irritation evident in it.::
35534::$$$message_0289_0053_0000$$$::"Hah, you suck. You lack power compared to the other Servants...!"[lr]::
35535::$$$message_0289_0053_0001$$$::I swing at the Servant standing in my way.[lr]::
35536::$$$message_0289_0053_0002$$$::"Khh...!"[lr]::
35537::$$$message_0289_0053_0003$$$::The Servant in black blocks my blow and jumps back, her hair flowing in her wake.::
35538::$$$message_0289_0054_0000$$$::"I can do it...!"[lr]::
35539::$$$message_0289_0054_0001$$$::There's nothing in my way now.[lr]::
35540::$$$message_0289_0054_0002$$$::The Servant in black retreated.[lr]::
35541::$$$message_0289_0054_0003$$$::If I just keep going just a few more meters like this...::
35542::$$$message_0289_0055_0000$$$::"...This is the end.[lr]::
35543::$$$message_0289_0055_0001$$$::From the very beginning, you've been dancing to my tune."::
35544::$$$message_0289_0056_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
35545::$$$message_0289_0056_0001$$$::My body falls.[lr]::
35546::$$$message_0289_0056_0002$$$::Rather, I'm being pulled backwards.[lr]::
35547::$$$message_0289_0056_0003$$$::My right arm hurts.[lr]::
35548::$$$message_0289_0056_0004$$$::Some unknown force is dragging my skewered arm back...!?::
35549::$$$message_0289_0057_0000$$$::"Do you still not understand? The object stabbing your arm is my nail."[lr]::
35550::$$$message_0289_0057_0001$$$::"Your nail...!?"::
35551::$$$message_0289_0058_0000$$$::That makes me realize.[lr]::
35552::$$$message_0289_0058_0001$$$::Extending from her weapon...[lr]::
35553::$$$message_0289_0058_0002$$$::The grating sound of metal against metal...[lr]::
35554::$$$message_0289_0058_0003$$$::The sound of chains...[lr]::
35555::$$$message_0289_0058_0004$$$::I've been hearing them ever since leaving that doorway and[line2]::
35556::$$$message_0289_0059_0000$$$::"Shi[line2]!"[lr]::
35557::$$$message_0289_0059_0001$$$::I reach out for my right arm with my left hand, but it's too late.[lr]::
35558::$$$message_0289_0059_0002$$$::Dragged by some invisible force, my arm flies up and out of reach.::
35559::$$$message_0289_0060_0000$$$::"Guh...!!! Agh...!"[lr]::
35560::$$$message_0289_0060_0001$$$::With no mercy to my agony, it lifts me into the air...[lr]::
35561::$$$message_0289_0060_0002$$$::The nail piercing my arm is attached to a chain.[lr]::
35562::$$$message_0289_0060_0003$$$::The chain extends up into the canopy, using a branch as a fulcrum, and leaving me strung up by it.::
35563::$$$message_0289_0061_0000$$$::"Agh... Guh...!"[lr]::
35564::$$$message_0289_0061_0001$$$::"...Well then. You said something interesting earlier."[lr]::
35565::$$$message_0289_0061_0002$$$::...The Servant in black approaches.[lr]::
35566::$$$message_0289_0061_0003$$$::I can't run away or fight now that I'm suspended in the air.::
35567::$$$message_0289_0062_0000$$$::"You said that I am inferior to other Servants.[lr]::
35568::$$$message_0289_0062_0001$$$::This is most troubling. I must correct this mistaken perception before I can slay you."[lr]::
35569::$$$message_0289_0062_0002$$$::...I'm like a sacrifice.[lr]::
35570::$$$message_0289_0062_0003$$$::It's like I've been sent to the gallows in a Western.::
35571::$$$message_0289_0063_0000$$$::The nail-like dagger is raised.[lr]::
35572::$$$message_0289_0063_0001$$$::The Servant in black licks the tip of it.[lr]::
35573::$$$message_0289_0063_0002$$$::"Let me see. First, I shall take those mistaken eyes.[lr]::
35574::$$$message_0289_0063_0003$$$::Then your remaining limbs afterwards."[lr]::
35575::$$$message_0289_0063_0004$$$::She makes a nimble jump and appears right before me, suspended three meters in the air.::
35576::$$$message_0289_0064_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
35577::$$$message_0289_0064_0001$$$::The nail is swung downwards.[lr]::
35578::$$$message_0289_0064_0002$$$::My body can still move.[lr]::
35579::$$$message_0289_0064_0003$$$::I...[lr]::
