22402::$$$message_0201_0000_0000$$$::It's only nine in the morning, but the area around the station is already busy.::
22403::$$$message_0201_0001_0000$$$::Most of the shops don't open until around ten o'clock, but cafes and smaller bookshops are starting to open up.[lr]::
22404::$$$message_0201_0001_0001$$$::There are already more people here than you'd expect in Miyama, even if it were a weekend.::
22405::$$$message_0201_0002_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
22406::$$$message_0201_0002_0001$$$::We get off the bus, and Saber looks around the area, displeased.[lr]::
22407::$$$message_0201_0002_0002$$$::I don't blame her.[lr]::
22408::$$$message_0201_0002_0003$$$::She hasn't really agreed to the whole date thing, and everyone is staring at her now.[lr]::
22409::$$$message_0201_0002_0004$$$::I doubt she loves that.::
22410::$$$message_0201_0003_0000$$$::"Crap. I should've figured this might happen if I brought Saber here in the morning."[lr]::
22411::$$$message_0201_0003_0001$$$::But this discomfort is bound to follow us around all day.[lr]::
22412::$$$message_0201_0003_0002$$$::The only cure for this I can think of is Saber enjoying herself so much she forgets all the awkwardness.::
22413::$$$message_0201_0004_0000$$$::"...All right."[lr]::
22414::$$$message_0201_0004_0001$$$::I smack my fist into my hand and look over to Saber.::
22415::$$$message_0201_0005_0000$$$::"Saber, before we start, is there anywhere you'd like to go? We came all the way out here, so we can do whatever you want today."::
22416::$$$message_0201_0006_0000$$$::"No, there is nothing. This place holds no particular interest to me, and I have little knowledge about it with which to make any other decisions."::
22417::$$$message_0201_0007_0000$$$::"Are you sure? Well this is going to be tough. Then I really do just have to wing it. If you don't want to go anywhere, and I don't know where to go, things are looking kinda grim."::
22418::$$$message_0201_0008_0000$$$::"I hope you are not saying you have made no plans for today, Shirou."[lr]::
22419::$$$message_0201_0008_0001$$$::"Hm? Well, I have some plans, but they're a little light on details. For the time being, let's just hit up as many shops as we can."::
22420::$$$message_0201_0009_0000$$$::That's...kinda hard too.[lr]::
22421::$$$message_0201_0009_0001$$$::I know some stores I'd enjoy, but I have no idea what girls like.[lr]::
22422::$$$message_0201_0009_0002$$$::Honestly, if I'd known this would happen to me someday, it'd have been smart to go out with a girl from class at least once.::
22423::$$$message_0201_0010_0000$$$::"I do not intend to object, but there is something wrong with you, Shirou. I would not have thought much had you suggested to take a break. But that you have no plan for this interlude is completely ridiculous."::
22424::$$$message_0201_0011_0000$$$::Crap, now Saber's in lecturing mode.[lr]::
22425::$$$message_0201_0011_0001$$$::This is the first time she's ever given me such an earful outside the dojo.[lr]::
22426::$$$message_0201_0011_0002$$$::She wasn't into this from the start, and I figured all the people staring at her wouldn't help, but I didn't realize it'd be this bad.::
22427::$$$message_0201_0012_0000$$$::"I have been waiting for the opportunity to bring up your lack of planning. You may be keenly aware of the people around you, but you care little for yourself.[lr]::
22428::$$$message_0201_0012_0001$$$::Consequently, you end up paying the price for your lack of self-regard."[lr]::
22429::$$$message_0201_0012_0002$$$::"Hey! Are you listening, Shirou!?"::
22430::$$$message_0201_0013_0000$$$::"I am. Bottom line is that you don't understand why you're here. Right, Saber?[lr]::
22431::$$$message_0201_0013_0001$$$::I know the places I'm going to take you will bore you, so I don't blame you for not liking it."::
22432::$$$message_0201_0014_0000$$$::"Er...um, it is not that, but I...I am only saying that now is not the time for this kind of thing."::
22433::$$$message_0201_0015_0000$$$::"I know that. But I'm also ignoring that since I've already decided to spend all day with you on a date, Saber.[lr]::
22434::$$$message_0201_0015_0001$$$::I'm not going to change my mind, no matter what you say. That's that."[lr]::
22435::$$$message_0201_0015_0002$$$::I look straight at Saber.[lr]::
22436::$$$message_0201_0015_0003$$$::The only thing Saber can do is look back at me in shock.::
22437::$$$message_0201_0016_0000$$$::"But if you have something to say, I'll at least hear you out.[lr]::
22438::$$$message_0201_0016_0001$$$::I'm sure you have things to say, and I'd appreciate it if you told me now. That way we won't have to worry about holding back later on.[lr]::
22439::$$$message_0201_0016_0002$$$::If you say you don't want to go on a date with me, I'll think of something else we can do."::
22440::$$$message_0201_0017_0000$$$::"Uh...no, you do not need to go through all that trouble. I just...ah..."[lr]::
22441::$$$message_0201_0017_0001$$$::It's odd, seeing Saber at a loss for words.::
22442::$$$message_0201_0018_0000$$$::"Well, if you have nothing to say, then let's go.[lr]::
22443::$$$message_0201_0018_0001$$$::You don't get to get mad about where we go since you don't have any requests."[lr]::
22444::$$$message_0201_0018_0002$$$::Maybe we should go to an aquarium. I hear those are popular.[lr]::
22445::$$$message_0201_0018_0003$$$::That sounds good, so I grab Saber's hand.::
22446::$$$message_0201_0019_0000$$$::"U-um, Shirou!? I-I am not complaining, but I do not think it is necessary to hold hands!"[lr]::
22447::$$$message_0201_0019_0001$$$::"Huh? Well we're wasting time here, so we're going to run a bit. And I'll guide you to where we're going, so follow me and don't let go."::
22448::$$$message_0201_0020_0000$$$::"Ah...um, but not like this...!"[lr]::
22449::$$$message_0201_0020_0001$$$::I start running without waiting for Saber's reply.[lr]::
22450::$$$message_0201_0020_0002$$$::I've been pretty clear with Saber, so no more being pathetic in front of her.[lr]::
22451::$$$message_0201_0020_0003$$$::For now, I just need to escort her to every place I can think of.::
22452::$$$message_0201_0021_0000$$$::Saber's hand in mine, I run through the crowd.[lr]::
22453::$$$message_0201_0021_0001$$$::Apparently, Saber's given up resisting, as she just follows obediently.::
22454::$$$message_0201_0022_0000$$$::It's a little before ten o'clock.[lr]::
22455::$$$message_0201_0022_0001$$$::We have two hours until lunchtime, so I'm going to make the most of that and really knock Saber's socks off.::
22456::$$$message_0201_0023_0000$$$::Those two hours were like a storm.::
22457::$$$message_0201_0024_0000$$$::First, we tried a boutique I'd normally never go to. Then we tried our hand at bowling while I taught her the rules.[lr]::
22458::$$$message_0201_0024_0001$$$::I could't find the aquarium, but we fed birds at the park.[lr]::
22459::$$$message_0201_0024_0002$$$::We visited an interesting antique shop that ended up being a lot of fun, and I maintain that not going to the movie theater was the right choice.[lr]::
22460::$$$message_0201_0024_0003$$$::Anyway, I spent the whole time taking her places I figured a girl might like, and it was two hours of failure and defeat.::
22461::$$$message_0201_0025_0000$$$::However I tried to spin it, the day wasn't really shaping up to be a date.[lr]::
22462::$$$message_0201_0025_0001$$$::It felt more like a battle to the death, in which the first person to give up loses.::
22463::$$$message_0201_0026_0000$$$::Wherever I took Saber, she acted exactly like she always has done. Once in a while, she would fall so quiet I would start to worry if she was truly angry.[lr]::
22464::$$$message_0201_0026_0001$$$::Her lack of reaction made it clear she was not having fun, which pushed me to try even harder each time.::
22465::$$$message_0201_0027_0000$$$::And so, I ran all around the city, desperate to make Saber smile, but noon came before I actually accomplished anything.::
22466::$$$message_0201_0028_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
22467::$$$message_0201_0028_0001$$$::...with Saber's reminder that it's lunchtime, I decide to take a short break. However...::
22468::$$$message_0201_0029_0000$$$::"What is this place...?"[lr]::
22469::$$$message_0201_0029_0001$$$::I can't help but blurt it out as we sit down.::
22470::$$$message_0201_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"I suggest going to the coffee shop near the river for lunch." [font italic=false][lr]::
22471::$$$message_0201_0030_0001$$$::That was the only advice Tohsaka gave me last night.[lr]::
22472::$$$message_0201_0030_0002$$$::So I did as she suggested and picked this restaurant, but I never imagined it would be so pretentious.::
22473::$$$message_0201_0031_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
22474::$$$message_0201_0031_0001$$$::I take a look at the menu.[lr]::
22475::$$$message_0201_0031_0002$$$::Luckily, the menu has Japanese translations next to all its foreign text, so I can at least figure out what all the dishes are.[lr]::
22476::$$$message_0201_0031_0003$$$::The problem is that I've never even heard of any of these dishes, and the prices are outrageous.::
22477::$$$message_0201_0032_0000$$$::"Where are we? On Mars or something? I have no idea what to order."[lr]::
22478::$$$message_0201_0032_0001$$$::I stare at the menu and growl.::
22479::$$$message_0201_0033_0000$$$::"Shirou? I thought we came here to eat lunch."[lr]::
22480::$$$message_0201_0033_0001$$$::Saber looks and sounds a little concerned.[lr]::
22481::$$$message_0201_0033_0002$$$::"Yeah, but this is really not what I expected."::
22482::$$$message_0201_0034_0000$$$::I look up.[lr]::
22483::$$$message_0201_0034_0001$$$::And what I see...[lr]::
22484::$$$message_0201_0034_0002$$$::...is Saber, looking like a cornered rabbit.::
22485::$$$message_0201_0035_0000$$$::"Saber...?"[lr]::
22486::$$$message_0201_0035_0001$$$::"If you are uneasy, we can head back to the mansion. I actually prefer the food you prepare, Shirou."::
22487::$$$message_0201_0036_0000$$$::"Eh...? Does that mean you want to go home?"[lr]::
22488::$$$message_0201_0036_0001$$$::"No. It is not that I want to go back, but I have been nervous all day, and am more tired than usual."::
22489::$$$message_0201_0037_0000$$$::"Really? Oh...I thought about going back out after we had lunch and a bit of a break, but if you're tired, maybe we should take a longer break here."::
22490::$$$message_0201_0038_0000$$$::"No...that is not what I mean! Tired is not quite the right word. It is more like...well..."::
22491::$$$message_0201_0039_0000$$$::Saber stops.[lr]::
22492::$$$message_0201_0039_0001$$$::Fortunately, I'm the only one who hears the faint squeak from her stomach.[lr]::
22493::$$$message_0201_0039_0002$$$::Oh. She could've just told me she was hungry.::
22494::$$$message_0201_0040_0000$$$::"I am sorry. What I am trying to say is that I would appreciate it if we could eat lunch as soon as possible."[lr]::
22495::$$$message_0201_0040_0001$$$::"Got it. Yeah, it may not be interesting, but let's order whatever looks okay here so we can get our food quick."::
22496::$$$message_0201_0041_0000$$$::It should be easy if a light snack is all we need.[lr]::
22497::$$$message_0201_0041_0001$$$::I order two things that seem like lunch dishes, and we quickly eat.::
22498::$$$message_0201_0042_0000$$$::While I'm drinking my after meal coffee, I start thinking about what to do in the afternoon.[lr]::
22499::$$$message_0201_0042_0001$$$::What I learned this morning is that physical stuff like bowling is no good.::
22500::$$$message_0201_0043_0000$$$::Saber is...[font italic=true]extremely[font italic=false] competitive.[lr]::
22501::$$$message_0201_0043_0001$$$::That in itself is good. But Saber's looks already draw enough attention, and when she gets like that, well, she stands out even more.[lr]::
22502::$$$message_0201_0043_0002$$$::After we finished a game, Saber got sulky because of all the attention she drew.::
22503::$$$message_0201_0044_0000$$$::"So we're going to avoid physical activities...[lr]::
22504::$$$message_0201_0044_0001$$$::Hey Saber. I'm going to ask you again: Is there anywhere you want to go?"::
22505::$$$message_0201_0045_0000$$$::"Me? No, nowhere in particular. I do not know my way around, so I will keep following you."::
22506::$$$message_0201_0046_0000$$$::Saber lifts her teacup as she speaks.[lr]::
22507::$$$message_0201_0046_0001$$$::She ordered black tea to have after her meal, and it seems she enjoys its flavor.[lr]::
22508::$$$message_0201_0046_0002$$$::I hardly serve black tea at home, and even if I did, it'd just be cheap tea bags.[lr]::
22509::$$$message_0201_0046_0003$$$::Saber must not have been satisfied with the drinks I've been serving at home, since it looks like she prefers black tea.[lr]::
22510::$$$message_0201_0046_0004$$$::Well, I should be more mindful about that starting tonight.::
22511::$$$message_0201_0047_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22512::$$$message_0201_0047_0001$$$::Saber isn't doing much...she's just drinking her tea.[lr]::
22513::$$$message_0201_0047_0002$$$::She doesn't seem particularly happy, but she doesn't exactly look bored either.::
22514::$$$message_0201_0048_0000$$$::I guess she's just...being Saber.[lr]::
22515::$$$message_0201_0048_0001$$$::As sunlight pours in through the window, Saber sits up straight, gracefully sipping from her teacup.[lr]::
22516::$$$message_0201_0048_0002$$$::It's the first time I've seen her do this, but it seems so natural it's like I've seen it a million times before.[lr]::
22517::$$$message_0201_0048_0003$$$::I don't know why I'm thinking that.[lr]::
22518::$$$message_0201_0048_0004$$$::Saber, at least as I know her, is always serious, only focused on wielding her sword, on fighting.::
22519::$$$message_0201_0049_0000$$$::"Oh, I get it."[lr]::
22520::$$$message_0201_0049_0001$$$::It's only natural.[lr]::
22521::$$$message_0201_0049_0002$$$::I only think of her as the girl who takes up her sword.[lr]::
22522::$$$message_0201_0049_0003$$$::The moment she sets her sword aside, Saber is always calm and gentle.::
22523::$$$message_0201_0050_0000$$$::This scene doesn't feel new or unnatural me because it's just...her being who she is.[lr]::
22524::$$$message_0201_0050_0001$$$::No matter how skilled a swordsman she is, this is Saber just being normal.[lr]::
22525::$$$message_0201_0050_0002$$$::Or...wielding her sword isn't what makes her exceptional.::
22526::$$$message_0201_0051_0000$$$::I once thought while I was dreaming that she was suited for fighting.[lr]::
22527::$$$message_0201_0051_0001$$$::I don't think I'm wrong there.[lr]::
22528::$$$message_0201_0051_0002$$$::No matter how great her sword skills are...no matter how many battlefields she's been on...[lr]::
22529::$$$message_0201_0051_0003$$$::...as long as she was really herself, she couldn't have found the battlefield a comfortable place to be.::
22530::$$$message_0201_0052_0000$$$::That's why this is how it's supposed to be.[lr]::
22531::$$$message_0201_0052_0001$$$::Saber is not wielding a sword... She is just resting and unwinding.[lr]::
22532::$$$message_0201_0052_0002$$$::She belongs in this serene setting.::
