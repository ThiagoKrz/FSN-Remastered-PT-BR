76779::$$$message_0712_0000_0000$$$::"All right, let's split up for now. I'm going home to get my things. You can go on ahead, Shirou."[lr]::
76780::$$$message_0712_0000_0001$$$::"Your things? Are you coming over, too?"::
76781::$$$message_0712_0001_0000$$$::"Obviously. We're going to be fighting together, so we need to actually be together. Illya doesn't like my house, and Sakura's already at your place, so that makes your house our base of operations."::
76782::$$$message_0712_0002_0000$$$::"Oh. It does, now that you mention it."[lr]::
76783::$$$message_0712_0002_0001$$$::"...Good grief. Just when I think you're getting the hang of this, you space out. Maybe I made a mistake after all..."[lr]::
76784::$$$message_0712_0002_0002$$$::Tohsaka sighs dramatically and heads down the opposite path.::
76785::$$$message_0712_0003_0000$$$::"Illya, my house is this way. Why are you going with Tohsaka?"[lr]::
76786::$$$message_0712_0003_0001$$$::"I'll just be a bit. Rin said she needed my help with something. I'll come over as soon as we're finished, so go on home first, Shirou."[lr]::
76787::$$$message_0712_0003_0002$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
76788::$$$message_0712_0003_0003$$$::Illya's going to help Tohsaka?::
76789::$$$message_0712_0004_0000$$$::"Really, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
76790::$$$message_0712_0004_0001$$$::"Really. We could use a secret weapon or two with things as they are. There's also some lids I can't open that an Einzbern mage might be able to.[lr]::
76791::$$$message_0712_0004_0002$$$::...Though, I'd like to avoid digging up any Tohsaka heirlooms if we can help it. If Grandmaster Kischur's souvenirs are what I think they are, I can't handle them by myself."::
76792::$$$message_0712_0005_0000$$$::"Then I should come, too. I'm not interested in Kischur's relics, but Zel Schweinorg sounds pretty nice."[lr]::
76793::$$$message_0712_0005_0001$$$::Illya pivots and runs after Tohsaka, her skirt fluttering.::
76794::$$$message_0712_0006_0000$$$::"...Kissher? Zel? Shavineorg?"[lr]::
76795::$$$message_0712_0006_0001$$$::I stand there, confused.[lr]::
76796::$$$message_0712_0006_0002$$$::I've never heard the name before. Maybe it's a famous term that only real mages know.::3
