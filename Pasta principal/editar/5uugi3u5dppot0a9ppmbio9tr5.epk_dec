76940::$$$message_0714_0000_0000$$$::"Oh, right. Sakura, this is Illya.[lr]::
76941::$$$message_0714_0000_0001$$$::Her Berserker got taken out, but we managed to save her. She's going to be staying with us like Tohsaka, so try to get along."[lr]::
76942::$$$message_0714_0000_0002$$$::I introduce Sakura and Illya to each other.::
76943::$$$message_0714_0001_0000$$$::"Hi, Sakura. I heard you're a daughter of the Makiris, but I won't hold that against you. You seem like you know Shirou, so I'll give you special treatment."[lr]::
76944::$$$message_0714_0001_0001$$$::"...Okay. Then I'll treat you the same way."::
76945::$$$message_0714_0002_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
76946::$$$message_0714_0002_0001$$$::That's the extent of their greetings.[lr]::
76947::$$$message_0714_0002_0002$$$::Illya leaves Tohsaka and walks to the living room.[lr]::
76948::$$$message_0714_0002_0003$$$::As she does...[lr]::
76949::$$$message_0714_0002_0004$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76950::$$$message_0714_0002_0005$$$::I see Sakura watching her with somewhat cold eyes.::
76951::$$$message_0714_0003_0000$$$::Dinner comes and goes like a sudden storm.[lr]::
76952::$$$message_0714_0003_0001$$$::...Okay, to call it a storm would be misleading.[lr]::
76953::$$$message_0714_0003_0002$$$::It was more like a doldrum where you lose track of time because there's no wind, and then it ends before you know it.[lr]::
76954::$$$message_0714_0003_0003$$$::Anyway, it was a dinner fraught with tension.::
76955::$$$message_0714_0004_0000$$$::"Should I make dinner, then? It'll be like having soba noodles for housewarming."[lr]::
76956::$$$message_0714_0004_0001$$$::With that, Tohsaka starts cooking on her own, and I'm forced to admit that she's better at it than me. Sakura's Western-style cooking might barely measure up.::
76957::$$$message_0714_0005_0000$$$::"T-Tohsaka-senpai, you're good at cooking."[lr]::
76958::$$$message_0714_0005_0001$$$::Sakura was stunned, but she still ended up eating the food too.[lr]::
76959::$$$message_0714_0005_0002$$$::I was so stressed out by everything happening, like Tohsaka's home cooking, eating together with Tohsaka, and Sakura looking downtrodden, not to mention the awkward vibe between her and Illya, that I couldn't really move much.::
76960::$$$message_0714_0006_0000$$$::As a result, I couldn't enjoy Tohsaka's excellent cooking, and spent the hour being reminded of what a flawless overachiever Rin Tohsaka is.::
76961::$$$message_0714_0007_0000$$$::    And then...[lr]::
76962::$$$message_0714_0007_0001$$$::"I've got some stuff to prep in my room, so I'll turn in for the night.[lr]::
76963::$$$message_0714_0007_0002$$$::We can hash out the details tomorrow morning. Get some rest, everyone."[lr]::
76964::$$$message_0714_0007_0003$$$::She even washes all the dishes until they're spotless before she excuses herself.::
76965::$$$message_0714_0008_0000$$$::"I'm going to my room, too. Everyone's tired after the forest today, so we'd better sleep early."[lr]::
76966::$$$message_0714_0008_0001$$$::I don't know if that was a dig at Sakura, but Illya leaves without looking at her.::
76967::$$$message_0714_0009_0000$$$::"...Haah. Seriously, what is going on..."[lr]::
76968::$$$message_0714_0009_0001$$$::In a sense, everything's going just as Tohsaka predicted, although Illya's attitude has been weird.[lr]::
76969::$$$message_0714_0009_0002$$$::The way she's treating Sakura is similar to the icy demeanor she had when we first met.::
76970::$$$message_0714_0010_0000$$$::"Why is Illya being so gruff with her when it's their first time meeting? The Einzberns and Makiris must not get along."::
76971::$$$message_0714_0011_0000$$$::According to Kotomine, the Einzberns, Makiris, and Tohsakas were prestigious mage families that founded the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
76972::$$$message_0714_0011_0001$$$::Apparently, the Einzberns had the most authority, so maybe Illya thinks of Tohsaka and Sakura as beneath her.::
76973::$$$message_0714_0012_0000$$$::"...Haah. I hope she doesn't give you the wrong impression, Sakura. Illya can be difficult when she's in a bad mood, but I'm sure you'll get along once you talk to her.[lr]::
76974::$$$message_0714_0012_0001$$$::She's just shy towards strangers[line2]hey, Sakura?"[lr]::
76975::$$$message_0714_0012_0002$$$::Sakura doesn't answer.[lr]::
76976::$$$message_0714_0012_0003$$$::I watch her head waver, until she falls limply backward[line2]::
76977::$$$message_0714_0013_0000$$$::"Sakura...!"[lr]::
76978::$$$message_0714_0013_0001$$$::I catch her by the shoulders.::
76979::$$$message_0714_0014_0000$$$::"...Huh, Senpai? What's wrong? Why are you making such a scary face?"[lr]::
76980::$$$message_0714_0014_0001$$$::...Sakura didn't even realize it.[lr]::
76981::$$$message_0714_0014_0002$$$::She's asking me what's happening, as if she wasn't about to faint.::
76982::$$$message_0714_0015_0000$$$::"...No, it's nothing."[lr]::
76983::$$$message_0714_0015_0001$$$::I let go of her shoulders.[lr]::
76984::$$$message_0714_0015_0002$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
76985::$$$message_0714_0015_0003$$$::Looks like that was enough to make her notice.::
76986::$$$message_0714_0016_0000$$$::"...I'm sorry. I was a little tired, so I fell asleep."[lr]::
76987::$$$message_0714_0016_0001$$$::She apologizes for something she doesn't even understand.::
76988::$$$message_0714_0017_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I bet you haven't had much rest for the last two days. You heard Tohsaka. Let's just go to sleep. You don't need to make yourself stay awake."::
76989::$$$message_0714_0018_0000$$$::"R-right. I'll take you up on that, then. I should feel better tomorrow if I get a good night's sleep.[lr]::
76990::$$$message_0714_0018_0001$$$::Since Tohsaka-senpai took care of us tonight, I'll make breakfast tomorrow morning. I'll cook the things you like for breakfast."::
76991::$$$message_0714_0019_0000$$$::She stands up with a mischievous grin.[lr]::
76992::$$$message_0714_0019_0001$$$::...Her gait is steady.[lr]::
76993::$$$message_0714_0019_0002$$$::Accompanying her to her bedroom would backfire right now.[lr]::
76994::$$$message_0714_0019_0003$$$::If Sakura's trying to convince me that she's okay, then I should believe her.::
76995::$$$message_0714_0020_0000$$$::"All right. Go ahead and show her who's boss.[lr]::
76996::$$$message_0714_0020_0001$$$::You're our last line of defense, Sakura. To be honest, we need to hit back at Tohsaka, or we're done for."[lr]::
76997::$$$message_0714_0020_0002$$$::"You can count on me. I'll knock her out in one punch!"::
76998::$$$message_0714_0021_0000$$$::That sounds promising... Mm, I'll do what little I can to help, too.[lr]::
76999::$$$message_0714_0021_0001$$$::Let's sleep early tonight, then meet up in the kitchen at six in the morning?"[lr]::
77000::$$$message_0714_0021_0002$$$::"Yes. I'll be waiting, Senpai."::
77001::$$$message_0714_0022_0000$$$::Sakura gives me a polite bow, and then leaves for the side hallway.[lr]::
77002::$$$message_0714_0022_0001$$$::Just before she's gone...[lr]::
77003::$$$message_0714_0022_0002$$$::"...Um, Senpai. Please don't tell my sister what happened just earlier."[lr]::
77004::$$$message_0714_0022_0003$$$::She says in a strained voice, without turning around.::
77005::$$$message_0714_0023_0000$$$::"Yeah. You just dozed off. It isn't worth mentioning."[lr]::
77006::$$$message_0714_0023_0001$$$::"...Right. Good night, Senpai."[lr]::
77007::$$$message_0714_0023_0002$$$::She slides the door shut.[lr]::
77008::$$$message_0714_0023_0003$$$::Sakura goes off to the guesthouse without looking back.::
77009::$$$message_0714_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77010::$$$message_0714_0024_0001$$$::She must mean her fainting spell.[lr]::
77011::$$$message_0714_0024_0002$$$::Sakura isn't recovering as well as she hopes.[lr]::
77012::$$$message_0714_0024_0003$$$::Kotomine said that she only has days left.[lr]::
77013::$$$message_0714_0024_0004$$$::Regardless of what Zouken wants to do with her, she isn't stable.::
77014::$$$message_0714_0025_0000$$$::That's why she's been trying to put on a strong front.[lr]::
77015::$$$message_0714_0025_0001$$$::She'll be fine.[lr]::
77016::$$$message_0714_0025_0002$$$::That's what she insists on telling us because she doesn't want us to worry.::
77017::$$$message_0714_0026_0000$$$::"Her sister, huh?"[lr]::
77018::$$$message_0714_0026_0001$$$::Sakura never refers to Tohsaka that way except when we're alone.[lr]::
77019::$$$message_0714_0026_0002$$$::And then only when something's weighing on her mind.[lr]::
77020::$$$message_0714_0026_0003$$$::...When she can't stop herself from wishing for help, she calls Tohsaka her big sister.[lr]::
77021::$$$message_0714_0026_0004$$$::Their complicated family background is what led to a wall being built between sisters.::
77022::$$$message_0714_0027_0000$$$::If we can destroy that wall, then they can go back to being regular siblings.[lr]::
77023::$$$message_0714_0027_0001$$$::I think that might be the best thing I can do for Sakura.::
77024::$$$message_0714_0028_0000$$$::"...Yeah. They're off to a rocky start, but there's still hope."[lr]::
77025::$$$message_0714_0028_0001$$$::No one saw this situation coming, but it might turn out to be a good chance to tear down that wall.::
