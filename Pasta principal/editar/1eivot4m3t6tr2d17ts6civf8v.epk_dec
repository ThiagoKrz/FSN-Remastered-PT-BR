60945::$$$message_0555_0000_0000$$$::Time passes. It's now 10:00 AM.[lr]::
60946::$$$message_0555_0000_0001$$$::I feel much better since eating Sakura's porridge.[lr]::
60947::$$$message_0555_0000_0002$$$::The sluggishness I felt this morning is gone.[lr]::
60948::$$$message_0555_0000_0003$$$::It doesn't impede my movement, and I think I could go to school if I wanted.::
60949::$$$message_0555_0001_0000$$$::However...[lr]::
60950::$$$message_0555_0001_0001$$$::I wonder if this wasn't a cold after all, but maybe the result of serious malnutrition. Just as I make to get out of bed...[lr]::
60951::$$$message_0555_0001_0002$$$::"No, don't! You need to rest until your fever goes down, Senpai!"[lr]::
60952::$$$message_0555_0001_0003$$$::Sakura rushes over and pushes me down.::
60953::$$$message_0555_0002_0000$$$::"Whew."[lr]::
60954::$$$message_0555_0002_0001$$$::And...[lr]::
60955::$$$message_0555_0002_0002$$$::Sakura seems so enthusiastic, she made me breakfast, and I still feel pretty slow, so I decide to stay lying down.::
60956::$$$message_0555_0003_0000$$$::After feeding me okayu, she leaves, saying she has something else to do.[lr]::
60957::$$$message_0555_0003_0001$$$::Saber's resting in the living room.[lr]::
60958::$$$message_0555_0003_0002$$$::She was kneeling in a corner of my room until just earlier, but it was making me nervous, so I asked her to move to the living room.[lr]::
60959::$$$message_0555_0003_0003$$$::She protested, naturally, but I convinced her to take up a different guard post just for today.::
60960::$$$message_0555_0004_0000$$$::"Pardon me. How are you feeling, Senpai?"[lr]::
60961::$$$message_0555_0004_0001$$$::"A lot better, thanks to you. I still feel slow, but my fever's coming down."::
60962::$$$message_0555_0005_0000$$$::"I'm glad to hear that. You don't need medicine anymore, then. I'll make you something good to eat, so just take it easy."[lr]::
60963::$$$message_0555_0005_0001$$$::Sakura goes into the room next door and brings out a new futon.::
60964::$$$message_0555_0006_0000$$$::"What are you doing, Sakura?"[lr]::
60965::$$$message_0555_0006_0001$$$::"Giving you a new futon. You were sweating all night, so I thought you'd need a change of bedding."[lr]::
60966::$$$message_0555_0006_0002$$$::She lays out the futon next to mine, patting it flat in a practiced motion.[lr]::
60967::$$$message_0555_0006_0003$$$::To my surprise, there isn't any dust at all. ::
60968::$$$message_0555_0007_0000$$$:: "Here it is. Go ahead and change beds, Senpai. Oh, but you should change clothes first. I'll hang your futon out to dry, so please change into these fresh pajamas."[lr]::
60969::$$$message_0555_0007_0001$$$::After the futon, Sakura brings out a stack of clean sleepwear.::
60970::$$$message_0555_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60971::$$$message_0555_0008_0001$$$::Such...flawless nursing.[lr]::
60972::$$$message_0555_0008_0002$$$::This goes beyond mere experience or thoughtfulness.::
60973::$$$message_0555_0009_0000$$$::"It's a genetic skill. It's gotta be baked into your DNA."[lr]::
60974::$$$message_0555_0009_0001$$$::"What did you say, Senpai?"[lr]::
60975::$$$message_0555_0009_0002$$$::"It's inappropriate, I know, but I'm glad you stayed home from school today.[lr]::
60976::$$$message_0555_0009_0003$$$::It's like I'm seeing a brand new side of you, to be honest."::
60977::$$$message_0555_0010_0000$$$::"But of course! It's already been a year and a half, so I know everything about your house."[lr]::
60978::$$$message_0555_0010_0001$$$::Sakura proudly puffs out her chest.[lr]::
60979::$$$message_0555_0010_0002$$$::Her confidence and positivity feels infectious.::
60980::$$$message_0555_0011_0000$$$::"All right. Then take care of the bed. I'll be a good patient and follow orders."[lr]::
60981::$$$message_0555_0011_0001$$$::"You can count on me! I'll peel some apples for you once I hang up the futon, so look forward to it!"[lr]::
60982::$$$message_0555_0011_0002$$$::Sakura goes into the hallway, carrying the futon I've been sleeping in.::
60983::$$$message_0555_0012_0000$$$::"Wow. She took everything with her."[lr]::
60984::$$$message_0555_0012_0001$$$::Impressed by her high spirits, I change into the pajamas she brought me.::
60985::$$$message_0555_0013_0000$$$::Now, then...[lr]::
60986::$$$message_0555_0013_0001$$$::I dry myself off with a towel, change into clean pajamas, and obediently get back into bed to wait for Sakura.::
60987::$$$message_0555_0014_0000$$$::How long is this all taking, I wonder?[lr]::
60988::$$$message_0555_0014_0001$$$::Sakura peels me an apple as promised, I enjoy snacking on it, and...[lr]::
60989::$$$message_0555_0014_0002$$$::"Oh, Senpai. I said not to push yourself."[lr]::
60990::$$$message_0555_0014_0003$$$::...she scolds me even though I feel better now, so I lie back down.::
60991::$$$message_0555_0015_0000$$$::"So Saber helped you?"[lr]::
60992::$$$message_0555_0015_0001$$$::"Yes. She said she was tired of doing nothing, so she saved me the trouble of cleaning the guestroom."[lr]::
60993::$$$message_0555_0015_0002$$$::"Huh. I'd like to see Saber wringing out some washcloths.[lr]::
60994::$$$message_0555_0015_0003$$$::So she pushed a washcloth up and down the hallway?"::
60995::$$$message_0555_0016_0000$$$::"Yes, we both worked hard. Saber said that she learned a lot."[lr]::
60996::$$$message_0555_0016_0001$$$::Sakura smiles, looking slightly troubled.[lr]::
60997::$$$message_0555_0016_0002$$$::She might have gotten used to Saber, but she still seems to be getting used to dealing with her.::
60998::$$$message_0555_0017_0000$$$::"...Okay. Anyway, good work. But don't work too hard. You're still recovering, too. It's already a lot of effort just to take care of me, so you don't need to worry about cleaning, too."[lr]::
60999::$$$message_0555_0017_0001$$$::"That isn't true. I spent the morning here, and I'm going to feed you dinner, too. It only makes sense that I'd clean while taking care of you. After all, I..."::
61000::$$$message_0555_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]I'm part of this family, too.[font italic=false][lr]::
61001::$$$message_0555_0018_0001$$$::Sakura mumbles under her breath, not wanting to sound rude by wishing it was true.::
61002::$$$message_0555_0019_0000$$$::"That's right. You, Fuji-nee, and me, we're like family."[lr]::
61003::$$$message_0555_0019_0001$$$::"Huh? Senpai?"::
61004::$$$message_0555_0020_0000$$$::"Sorry for keeping you at a distance. If you're family, then it's only normal for us to take care of one another.[lr]::
61005::$$$message_0555_0020_0001$$$::I know I'd look after you too if you collapsed, no matter how awkward it makes you feel.[lr]::
61006::$$$message_0555_0020_0002$$$::So, I'm the one being silly for trying not to impose."[lr]::
61007::$$$message_0555_0020_0003$$$::I apologize.::
61008::$$$message_0555_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
61009::$$$message_0555_0021_0001$$$::The conversation stops.[lr]::
61010::$$$message_0555_0021_0002$$$::After a moment's surprise during which Sakura held her breath...::
61011::$$$message_0555_0022_0000$$$::"Yes. I'm glad you know that. I think you're a little overprotective of people sometimes."[lr]::
61012::$$$message_0555_0022_0001$$$::She smiles happily and straightens out my sheets for me.::
61013::$$$message_0555_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
61014::$$$message_0555_0023_0001$$$::It made me realize something, finally.[lr]::
61015::$$$message_0555_0023_0002$$$::How beautiful this house is.[lr]::
61016::$$$message_0555_0023_0003$$$::The reason we've been tending to the unused rooms without even really thinking about it, how lively and lived-in it feels, just like when my old man was still around.::
61017::$$$message_0555_0024_0000$$$::My underclassman at school. My friend's little sister.[lr]::
61018::$$$message_0555_0024_0001$$$::That's what Sakura was to me when we first met, but she's been protecting this home even more than I have.[lr]::
61019::$$$message_0555_0024_0002$$$::For the last year and a half, the days were truly peaceful.[lr]::
61020::$$$message_0555_0024_0003$$$::I took it for granted so much that I never noticed.[lr]::
61021::$$$message_0555_0024_0004$$$::Sakura brought me and Fuji-nee something that we never could have obtained on our own.::
61022::$$$message_0555_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
61023::$$$message_0555_0025_0001$$$::Absently, I look up at Sakura.[lr]::
61024::$$$message_0555_0025_0002$$$::Maybe it's because I still have a slight fever, or because Sakura looks so happy taking care of me.[lr]::
61025::$$$message_0555_0025_0003$$$::When I see her smile, it warms me up inside and makes me sleepy.::
61026::$$$message_0555_0026_0000$$$::"Mm..."[lr]::
61027::$$$message_0555_0026_0001$$$::Huh, I'm pretty sleepy.[lr]::
61028::$$$message_0555_0026_0002$$$::It feels...nice. I feel bad for sleeping until lunchtime, but for now, I think I'll close my eyes and...[lr]::
61029::$$$message_0555_0026_0003$$$::"But Senpai? That's what I love about you."::
61030::$$$message_0555_0027_0000$$$::"Eh?"[lr]::
61031::$$$message_0555_0027_0001$$$::I think she just said something that would send my heart aflutter.::
61032::$$$message_0555_0028_0000$$$::"S-Sakura?"[lr]::
61033::$$$message_0555_0028_0001$$$::"S-Senpai!?[lr]::
61034::$$$message_0555_0028_0002$$$::You were awake!?"[lr]::
61035::$$$message_0555_0028_0003$$$::Sakura backs away from me in a panic.[lr]::
61036::$$$message_0555_0028_0004$$$::If she reacts like that, it only makes me blush. In fact, I'm worried I'm going to spike another fever.::
61037::$$$message_0555_0029_0000$$$::"Ah, uh, um, Sakura[line2]"[lr]::
61038::$$$message_0555_0029_0001$$$::"I-I didn't say anything! Nothing at all! I was just watching your face because of...your fever! Yeah, I was about to take your temperature!"[lr]::
61039::$$$message_0555_0029_0002$$$::She hastily takes out the thermometer and looms over me.::
61040::$$$message_0555_0030_0000$$$::"Senpai, this is a thermometer! I-I'm going to take your temperature, so open your mouth!"[lr]::
61041::$$$message_0555_0030_0001$$$::The thermometer inches threateningly towards me, its holder losing her composure.::
61042::$$$message_0555_0031_0000$$$::"Eherm?"[lr]::
61043::$$$message_0555_0031_0001$$$::I feel something squishy.[lr]::
61044::$$$message_0555_0031_0002$$$::...It only brushed me, but it was Sakura's chest.::
61045::$$$message_0555_0032_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
61046::$$$message_0555_0032_0001$$$::My brain reaches its boiling point.[lr]::
61047::$$$message_0555_0032_0002$$$::Sanity begins to crack under the strain of forbidden memories springing back to mind, and the sensation of an all-too-real female.::
61048::$$$message_0555_0033_0000$$$::"Whoa![lr]::
61049::$$$message_0555_0033_0001$$$::W-wait, Sakura, time out!"[lr]::
61050::$$$message_0555_0033_0002$$$::"Kyah!?"[lr]::
61051::$$$message_0555_0033_0003$$$::I make a last-ditch effort to roll out of bed.[lr]::
61052::$$$message_0555_0033_0004$$$::My body slides out of the futon. My first priority is to get away from those boo[line2]I mean, away from Sakura!::
61053::$$$message_0555_0034_0000$$$::"S-Senpai...? Um, I want to check your fever."[lr]::
61054::$$$message_0555_0034_0001$$$::"I'm f-fine! I can do it myself, so stop right there!"[lr]::
61055::$$$message_0555_0034_0002$$$::"...? If you say so.[lr]::
61056::$$$message_0555_0034_0003$$$::Here's the thermometer[line2]"::
61057::$$$message_0555_0035_0000$$$::"Nooo![lr]::
61058::$$$message_0555_0035_0001$$$::Not right now! Just give me a minute to calm down! If you get any closer, it'll remind me of last night's dream and I'll die!"[lr]::
61059::$$$message_0555_0035_0002$$$::I make a stop sign gesture, my face beet red.::
61060::$$$message_0555_0036_0000$$$::    But.[lr]::
61061::$$$message_0555_0036_0001$$$::"Last night's dream?"[lr]::
61062::$$$message_0555_0036_0002$$$::I must be acting really weird, because Sakura suddenly gives me a dubious look.::
61063::$$$message_0555_0037_0000$$$::"Ah...oof. Um, I had a bad nightmare.[lr]::
61064::$$$message_0555_0037_0001$$$::I'm trying not to think about it, so I need you to stay over there. J-just saying, but you didn't do anything wrong. I'm the one who lacks training."::
61065::$$$message_0555_0038_0000$$$::"Uh-huh. Training, you say...?"[lr]::
61066::$$$message_0555_0038_0001$$$::Sakura watches me vacantly.[lr]::
61067::$$$message_0555_0038_0002$$$::...Anyone would, after hearing something like that.::
61068::$$$message_0555_0039_0000$$$::"Um, Senpai, what kind of dream was it?"[lr]::
61069::$$$message_0555_0039_0001$$$::"Urgh."[lr]::
61070::$$$message_0555_0039_0002$$$::Like hell I can answer that!::
61071::$$$message_0555_0040_0000$$$::"It was n-no big deal. Just a bad dream."[lr]::
61072::$$$message_0555_0040_0001$$$::"Senpai..."[lr]::
61073::$$$message_0555_0040_0002$$$::Oof. Sakura's eyes become concerned.[lr]::
61074::$$$message_0555_0040_0003$$$::...I can't lie to her. But I also can't tell her the truth.[lr]::
61075::$$$message_0555_0040_0004$$$::So, I...[lr]::
