11473::$$$message_0114_0000_0000$$$::You imbecile!::
11474::$$$message_0114_0000_0001$$$::Imbecile!::
11475::$$$message_0114_0000_0002$$$::What the hell were you thinking, going out there when her wounds haven't even healed yet![lr]::
11476::$$$message_0114_0000_0003$$$::You just became a Master, so you need to train a bit more!::
11477::$$$message_0114_0000_0004$$$::That's right. You might not be able to avoid me killing you, but letting that vixen kill you is so uncool. Hurry back to your previous choice and stay home tonight!::
11478::$$$message_0114_0000_0005$$$::That's right. Make sure you think real hard and next time choose more carefully.::
11479::$$$message_0114_0000_0006$$$::Well now. Your friendly Tiger Dojo, which welcomes you with open arms despite your stupid mistakes, is entering its third episode already.::
11480::$$$message_0114_0000_0007$$$::Everyone might be getting used to this dojo by now.::
11481::$$$message_0114_0000_0008$$$::Are they really? What are you trying to get at, Taiga? Is there something you want to say?::
11482::$$$message_0114_0000_0009$$$::Yes. Actually, I'm sure everyone is starting to wonder by now...::
11483::$$$message_0114_0000_0010$$$::About what...?::
11484::$$$message_0114_0000_0011$$$::Hmmm, then I'm going to say it...::
11485::$$$message_0114_0000_0012$$$::Don't you think wearing gym shorts is a little on the nose!?::
11486::$$$message_0114_0000_0013$$$::Eh? But isn't this a dojo? I'm going to be working out, so I'm just wearing gym clothes.::
11487::$$$message_0114_0000_0014$$$::...I see. So that was why. I guess that makes sense. I just thought it was some sort of scheme a naughty girl like you would come up with to steal what little thunder I have.::
11488::$$$message_0114_0000_0015$$$::You're thinking waaay too much about this, Taiga. You and I are on completely different levels. I don't have to be dressed to the nines to beat someone like you.::
11489::$$$message_0114_0000_0016$$$::Oh, you're right! You and I are treated very differently, and there's no need to compete with each other.::
11490::$$$message_0114_0000_0017$$$::Good, good. We're gonna be BFFs![lr]::
11491::$$$message_0114_0000_0018$$$::A gym uniform is a sign of energetic vitality, so I'll allow you to keep wearing it.::
11492::$$$message_0114_0000_0019$$$::Obviously. Well, you can count your blessings that I'm not in a maid outfit or a school swimsuit. I was actually thinking of wearing different outfits every time, you know?::
11493::$$$message_0114_0000_0020$$$::Ack. What's with the obvious special treatment?[lr]::
11494::$$$message_0114_0000_0021$$$::Heh. I'm not jealous. That idea got nixed anyway, so you and I are on an even playing field.::
11495::$$$message_0114_0000_0022$$$::But I'm a little curious.[lr]::
11496::$$$message_0114_0000_0023$$$::What other outfits were you planning on wearing?::
11497::$$$message_0114_0000_0024$$$::Uh...things like a boys' school uniform, a Kamakura-style outfit, a grown-up me version, a snowman, an apron, a kimono, a German-style military officer uniform…::
11498::$$$message_0114_0000_0025$$$::Lo and behold, there were supposed to be forty different variations!::
11499::$$$message_0114_0000_0026$$$::Gwaaahhh! I've heard enough! Your blessed love is too much...I hate it![lr]::
11500::$$$message_0114_0000_0027$$$::Also, I kind of wanted to see the military uniform, so I'm a little disappointed in that.::
11501::$$$message_0114_0000_0028$$$::Yeah. I think it would be childish to change something that's already been decided.::
11502::$$$message_0114_0000_0029$$$::I totally agree! What were the developers thinking, getting rid of my route!? Do they just hate money!?::
11503::$$$message_0114_0000_0030$$$::There was no route even planned for you.::
11504::$$$message_0114_0000_0031$$$::What, meow!? Hey, you scoundrel, get back here!::
11505::$$$message_0114_0000_0032$$$::Kyaaah!!! HEEEEEEEEELLLP!!!::
11506::$$$message_0114_0000_0033$$$::Oh hey there, Rin.::
11507::$$$message_0114_0000_0034$$$::Well, just take it easy.::
11508::$$$message_0114_0000_0035$$$::And she's gone...and Taiga's out cold, so maybe I should head back too.::
11509::$$$message_0114_0000_0036$$$::Go get your stamp and...okay! See you at the next dead end!::
