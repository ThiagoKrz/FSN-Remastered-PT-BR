17415::$$$message_0160_0000_0000$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
17416::$$$message_0160_0000_0001$$$::I think I got what Projection magecraft is all about, but I want more detail.[lr]::
17417::$$$message_0160_0000_0002$$$::Especially the part about taking an image and giving it shape.::
17418::$$$message_0160_0001_0000$$$::"Hey Tohsaka, sorry to interrupt you, but..."::
17419::$$$message_0160_0002_0000$$$::"What is it? If you are about to tell me to hurry up, I'm about to kick you.[lr]::
17420::$$$message_0160_0002_0001$$$::I'm so IRRITATED now, 'cause I can't find what I'm looking for. Argh! Why does everything I put away disappear in this house!?"::
17421::$$$message_0160_0003_0000$$$::She complains to herself as she searches.[lr]::
17422::$$$message_0160_0003_0001$$$::Classic Tohsaka.[lr]::
17423::$$$message_0160_0003_0002$$$::Especially the part where she stumbles in the preparation phase, even though she executes everything else flawlessly.::
17424::$$$message_0160_0004_0000$$$::"Come on, forget about it. Can you just tell me more about what we were discussing earlier?[lr]::
17425::$$$message_0160_0004_0001$$$::The stuff about how Projections are replicas created using images."::
17426::$$$message_0160_0005_0000$$$::"Hmph. Fine. This might even be useful for you anyway."[lr]::
17427::$$$message_0160_0005_0001$$$::She's definitely in a bad mood.[lr]::
17428::$$$message_0160_0005_0002$$$::She tosses aside the duffel bag she'd been rummaging through and plops down in a chair.::
17429::$$$message_0160_0006_0000$$$::"Okay, let me explain.[lr]::
17430::$$$message_0160_0006_0001$$$::You only use Projection when there's something you need but don't have on hand. Alternately, you can create things that don't normally exist in this world, or that have been long lost.[lr]::
17431::$$$message_0160_0006_0002$$$::If you can imagine every detail of the real thing, you can temporarily bring it into being with magical energy."::
17432::$$$message_0160_0007_0000$$$::"Remember I mentioned how anything you Project disappears because the magical energy disperses, right?[lr]::
17433::$$$message_0160_0007_0001$$$::No matter how strong the magical energy is, anything you Project will gradually fade away. But that's not all...[lr]::
17434::$$$message_0160_0007_0002$$$::The world simply won't allow such an illusion to remain.[lr]::
17435::$$$message_0160_0007_0003$$$::Which is why anything you Project won't even last a day in the real world."::
17436::$$$message_0160_0008_0000$$$::"Huh? What do you mean, the world won't allow it?"[lr]::
17437::$$$message_0160_0008_0001$$$::"Illusions can do anything precisely because they're illusions. But once an illusion takes shape though, it becomes reality.[lr]::
17438::$$$message_0160_0008_0002$$$::But those things do not exist in reality. In order to resolve that contradiction, reality sweeps in to dispose of the illusion."::
17439::$$$message_0160_0009_0000$$$::"Listen. Magecraft is meant to take things that exist and make them into something else. Transformation. Equivalent exchange.[lr]::
17440::$$$message_0160_0009_0001$$$::But that principle doesn't hold for illusions. If you, using an image of something that doesn't exist, create that thing in the real world, it becomes a contradiction."::
17441::$$$message_0160_0010_0000$$$::"That's why, when you Project something like Saber's sword[line2]which shouldn't exist in this age[line2]the world itself will destroy that illusion.[lr]::
17442::$$$message_0160_0010_0001$$$::It's great to create a miracle by connecting to the world, but creating a miracle that doesn't exist at all? That's forbidden.[lr]::
17443::$$$message_0160_0010_0002$$$::Normal magecraft is about bringing something real, something that [font italic=true]does[font italic=false] exist somewhere in the world, to you, so you can use it. But Projection magecraft creates something from an image in a person's mind."::
17444::$$$message_0160_0011_0000$$$::"Even magecraft can't create something which doesn't exist.[lr]::
17445::$$$message_0160_0011_0001$$$::It's an illusion that violates the laws of this world.[lr]::
17446::$$$message_0160_0011_0002$$$::In the same way a living creature's first priority is self-preservation, the world always seeks to protect its own integrity.[lr]::
17447::$$$message_0160_0011_0003$$$::The life of a world is all about order, which is why it will always crush any illusions which might disrupt that order, or intrude on reality itself."::
17448::$$$message_0160_0012_0000$$$::Tohsaka explains it rapidly, all in one breath.[lr]::
17449::$$$message_0160_0012_0001$$$::I don't understand half of it.::
17450::$$$message_0160_0013_0000$$$::"I see. So what I did was way beyond my limit."[lr]::
17451::$$$message_0160_0013_0001$$$::"That's what I've been saying![lr]::
17452::$$$message_0160_0013_0002$$$::Projection magecraft can shorten your life, so don't use it, even if Saber begs you to."::
17453::$$$message_0160_0014_0000$$$::Tohsaka resumes rummaging through her stuff.[lr]::
17454::$$$message_0160_0014_0001$$$::As I watch her blankly, I'm reminded again that me beating Berserker really was a miracle.::
