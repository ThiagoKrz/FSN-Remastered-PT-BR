11178::$$$message_0112_0000_0000$$$::I walk down the hill and return to the intersection.[lr]::
11179::$$$message_0112_0000_0001$$$::If I walk towards the residential area on the other side, I'll be heading home, but...::
11180::$$$message_0112_0001_0000$$$::"There's a Master at Ryudou Temple, huh?"[lr]::
11181::$$$message_0112_0001_0001$$$::That's about an hour's walk towards the mountain from here.[lr]::
11182::$$$message_0112_0001_0002$$$::The desolate mountain road eventually reaches the gates of Ryudou Temple.::
11183::$$$message_0112_0002_0000$$$::Ryudou Temple is a big temple up on the mountain; it's about the size of our school.[lr]::
11184::$$$message_0112_0002_0001$$$::The cemetery is large. The temple itself is like a small world of its own with about fifty training monks living on its grounds.[lr]::
11185::$$$message_0112_0002_0002$$$::The people in town use the Ryudou Temple for various purposes, but they also respect it as a sacred place that shouldn't be entered lightly.::
11186::$$$message_0112_0003_0000$$$::"Now that I think about it, I haven't been to Ryudou Temple recently."[lr]::
11187::$$$message_0112_0003_0001$$$::I haven't been there ever since I stayed there for some mental training last summer.[lr]::
11188::$$$message_0112_0003_0002$$$::I know temple life is harsh during the winter, so I was thinking about visiting during winter break...::
11189::$$$message_0112_0004_0000$$$::"Hm? What's a guy who cut afternoon classes doing here?"[lr]::
11190::$$$message_0112_0004_0001$$$::Speak of the devil.[lr]::
11191::$$$message_0112_0004_0002$$$::I run into Ryudou Temple's heir, Issei Ryudou, on the road.::
11192::$$$message_0112_0005_0000$$$::"Hey there. Is school over?"[lr]::
11193::$$$message_0112_0005_0001$$$::"Obviously. I don't have anything to do for the student council, so I was heading home. Is something wrong? You looked like you were staring up at the mountain."::
11194::$$$message_0112_0006_0000$$$::"No, there's nothing wrong. I just felt like going home." [lr]::
11195::$$$message_0112_0006_0001$$$::"Hmph. Teachers would be out of a job if people like you just cut classes whenever they felt like it. Anyway, I'm curious why you're staring at the mountain."::
11196::$$$message_0112_0007_0000$$$::"It's nothing. But can I ask you something? Has anything strange happened recently?"[lr]::
11197::$$$message_0112_0007_0001$$$::"Hm. Change is a constant, but doesn't lead to big, dramatic developments. The mountain is always at peace, and peace is the focus of daily life."::
11198::$$$message_0112_0008_0000$$$::"Issei, I'm being serious here."[lr]::
11199::$$$message_0112_0008_0001$$$::"H-how dare you! So am I!"::
11200::$$$message_0112_0009_0000$$$::"Guess you are. Sorry to bother you."[lr]::
11201::$$$message_0112_0009_0001$$$::"Hm. It's fine as long as you understand. I'd never kid around with you, Emiya."[lr]::
11202::$$$message_0112_0009_0002$$$::Issei clears his throat to calm himself down.::
11203::$$$message_0112_0010_0000$$$::"Though I do have to report that there has been a change. That said, I'm not entirely sure how to explain it..."[lr]::
11204::$$$message_0112_0010_0001$$$::"Eh...? A change? At the temple!?"::
11205::$$$message_0112_0011_0000$$$::"Yeah, but not of the mountain... However, the situation has left everyone in the temple restless. We have a guest at the temple, and they're apparently an acquaintance of my father, but the awkwardness is because of them... She's a beautiful woman, which makes it a touchy subject.[lr]::
11206::$$$message_0112_0011_0001$$$::Honestly, I don't know why there's such a fuss over a woman."::
11207::$$$message_0112_0012_0000$$$::"A woman? Does Ryudou Temple have any nuns?"::
11208::$$$message_0112_0013_0000$$$::"No. But they've made an exception for her, and we're letting her use a room until the wedding happens[line2]well, she really is beautiful, so I have to admit that even I get captivated by her looks whenever I go out and fetch water from the well."[lr]::
11209::$$$message_0112_0013_0001$$$::"What do you mean, an exception...? Issei? Hey...are you even listening?"::
11210::$$$message_0112_0014_0000$$$::"Hm...apologies. This is why women are bad news.[lr]::
11211::$$$message_0112_0014_0001$$$::Reject lust, Issei... Calm down, Issei..."[lr]::
11212::$$$message_0112_0014_0002$$$::The student council president mumbles some sort of sutra.::
11213::$$$message_0112_0015_0000$$$::"Hellooo? You okay, Issei?"[lr]::
11214::$$$message_0112_0015_0001$$$::"I'm quite all right. I'm just not as disciplined, so it's a matter of training harder."::
11215::$$$message_0112_0016_0000$$$::I can tell he's not listening.[lr]::
11216::$$$message_0112_0016_0001$$$::Issei continues to mumble, giving himself a pep talk, and disappears into the town's outskirts.::
11217::$$$message_0112_0017_0000$$$::By the time I get back home, the sun is almost setting.[lr]::
11218::$$$message_0112_0017_0001$$$::And just like yesterday, I'm the first one back home.[lr]::
11219::$$$message_0112_0017_0002$$$::Sakura and Fuji-nee will probably get here soon too, and Tohsaka will come home later on.::
11220::$$$message_0112_0018_0000$$$::"I'll mention what I learned from Shinji after Sakura and Fuji-nee go home."[lr]::
11221::$$$message_0112_0018_0001$$$::There's no point in talking in secret when those two are around.[lr]::
11222::$$$message_0112_0018_0002$$$::Having decided that, I'd better prepare dinner.::
11223::$$$message_0112_0019_0000$$$::Tohsaka beat me with her cooking last night, and I need to do something to improve Fuji-nee's mood.[lr]::
11224::$$$message_0112_0019_0001$$$::The secret ingredient to a great dish is time and effort, rather than love.[lr]::
11225::$$$message_0112_0019_0002$$$::If I want to guarantee my win, I'll have to spend double the time I usually would on cooking.::
11226::$$$message_0112_0020_0000$$$::...And so.[lr]::
11227::$$$message_0112_0020_0001$$$::Here's what happened: ::
11228::$$$message_0112_0021_0000$$$::"Hah! I didn't lose! Tohsaka, you're such a meanie!!!"[lr]::
11229::$$$message_0112_0021_0001$$$::"Let me reiterate. I'm not talking about the food's taste. According to you, tonight's dinner was the best you've ever tasted, so why not share it with everyone?"::
11230::$$$message_0112_0022_0000$$$::"Mmmng...I don't think that's what you meant.[lr]::
11231::$$$message_0112_0022_0001$$$::You said you didn't want to eat the food Shirou made."::
11232::$$$message_0112_0023_0000$$$::"I was only talking about breakfast. I will eat dinner like everyone, and Emiya and I made an arrangement to take turns cooking dinner. So what reason is there for me not to eat?[lr]::
11233::$$$message_0112_0023_0001$$$::If you don't like that, you're welcome to take my turn cooking tomorrow."::
11234::$$$message_0112_0024_0000$$$::"Ugh...so brazen. She strikes right at my weakness. Damn...I never imagined you were such a bad student."[lr]::
11235::$$$message_0112_0024_0001$$$::And with that, Fuji-nee reluctantly returns the wooden container of rice to the dining table.[lr]::
11236::$$$message_0112_0024_0002$$$::Five servings of my specialty mixed rice safely return to the dining table.::
11237::$$$message_0112_0025_0000$$$::"Come on, Fuji-nee. I made plenty of food today, so there's no need to hoard it. I made enough rice and side dishes for everyone."[lr]::
11238::$$$message_0112_0025_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Munch, munch.[font italic=false]::
11239::$$$message_0112_0026_0000$$$::"Y-you may be right, Senpai, but this might be a bit too much even for you..."[lr]::
11240::$$$message_0112_0026_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Clack, clack.[font italic=false]::
11241::$$$message_0112_0027_0000$$$::"Yes. A double-tiered barrel with food enough for four people is certainly over the top."[lr]::
11242::$$$message_0112_0027_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Chomp, chomp.[font italic=false]::
11243::$$$message_0112_0028_0000$$$::"It's not a barrel. It's a round wooden container for rice. The main dish is rice today, so I made extra. If we have any leftovers, I'll make them into rice balls for lunch tomorrow."[lr]::
11244::$$$message_0112_0028_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Munch, munch.[font italic=false]::
11245::$$$message_0112_0029_0000$$$::"Oh, can I get in on that lunch thing? I don't like fried rice made from leftover rice, but this is exceptional. There's all kinds of stuff in this rice...what's inside?"[lr]::
11246::$$$message_0112_0029_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Chew, chew.[font italic=false]::
11247::$$$message_0112_0030_0000$$$::"This is basically mushroom mixed rice, correct? And instead of using bean curd, you mixed in yuzu citrus to make it aromatic. Such detail."[lr]::
11248::$$$message_0112_0030_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Clank, clank.[font italic=false]::
11249::$$$message_0112_0031_0000$$$::"Fine! I'm going to eat this all by myself! Just you watch!"::
11250::$$$message_0112_0032_0000$$$::Fuji-nee must have given up monopolizing the wooden container of rice, but she starts to shovel food in her mouth with alarming speed.[lr]::
11251::$$$message_0112_0032_0001$$$::The moment her rice bowl is empty, she thrusts it out, requesting another helping.::
11252::$$$message_0112_0033_0000$$$::"That's fine, but you really don't need to rush. There's plenty, Fuji-nee..."[lr]::
11253::$$$message_0112_0033_0001$$$::"Don't mind me! I'm going to eat all the food that you made, Shirou! I won't be letting some stranger who just barged into our lives eat any of this food!"[lr]::
11254::$$$message_0112_0033_0002$$$::Fuji-nee snatches the rice bowl.::
11255::$$$message_0112_0034_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
11256::$$$message_0112_0034_0001$$$::I really don't get it.[lr]::
11257::$$$message_0112_0034_0002$$$::Sakura laughs uncomfortably, Tohsaka looks exasperated and ignores Fuji-nee, and Saber just sits, eating her food.[lr]::
11258::$$$message_0112_0034_0003$$$::I worked pretty hard to make all this, but it's looking like that might have backfired.[lr]::
11259::$$$message_0112_0034_0004$$$::The dinner, which I'd intended to make Tohsaka admit defeat, ended boisterously thanks to Fuji-nee's eccentric behavior.::
11260::$$$message_0112_0035_0000$$$::"I'll be heading home, Senpai."[lr]::
11261::$$$message_0112_0035_0001$$$::"Yeah. Fuji-nee, get Sakura home safely."[lr]::
11262::$$$message_0112_0035_0002$$$::"Yeah, yeah. I know. Don't worry."[lr]::
11263::$$$message_0112_0035_0003$$$::Fuji-nee takes Sakura's hand and they turn to go.::
11264::$$$message_0112_0036_0000$$$::"What? You're looking at me weird, Shirou."[lr]::
11265::$$$message_0112_0036_0001$$$::"Of course I am. No normal person could even move after eating so much."::
11266::$$$message_0112_0037_0000$$$::"You think so? I felt a bit full, but it was fine after I finished eating it all."[lr]::
11267::$$$message_0112_0037_0001$$$::...And the problem is that Taiga doesn't realize that people have limits.[lr]::
11268::$$$message_0112_0037_0002$$$::You can't really expect something like that from a wild tiger. Hopefully we can try to keep her contained so she doesn't run wild in polite society.::
11269::$$$message_0112_0038_0000$$$::"See you tomorrow. Don't stay up too late, you two."[lr]::
11270::$$$message_0112_0038_0001$$$::"Yes, Good night, Senpai."[lr]::
11271::$$$message_0112_0038_0002$$$::"Yep, night, Shirou."::
