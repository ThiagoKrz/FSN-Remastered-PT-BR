53512::$$$message_0463_0000_0000$$$::It's past seven.[lr]::
53513::$$$message_0463_0000_0001$$$::Fuji-nee already left for school, and we're cleaning up.[lr]::
53514::$$$message_0463_0000_0002$$$::Sakura doesn't need to rush today, so we take our time doing the dishes together.::
53515::$$$message_0463_0001_0000$$$::Morning clean-up goes by in a flash since we're both helping each other out.[lr]::
53516::$$$message_0463_0001_0001$$$::...I find myself checking on Sakura, but she looks like she's feeling better.[lr]::
53517::$$$message_0463_0001_0002$$$::It seems like her fever is gone, and she's full of energy.::
53518::$$$message_0463_0002_0000$$$::"Um, Senpai...![lr]::
53519::$$$message_0463_0002_0001$$$::M-might I have a moment of your time to talk!?"::
53520::$$$message_0463_0003_0000$$$::She suddenly blurts out a question, [lr]::
53521::$$$message_0463_0003_0001$$$::like it's now or never.::
53522::$$$message_0463_0004_0000$$$::"You certainly might. We still have plenty of time.[lr]::
53523::$$$message_0463_0004_0001$$$::"R-right. Well...um...I tried making lunch for you."[lr]::
53524::$$$message_0463_0004_0002$$$::Sakura hands me a lunchbox.::
53525::$$$message_0463_0005_0000$$$::It's different from the one I sometimes use. She must have prepared it herself.[lr]::
53526::$$$message_0463_0005_0001$$$::Unlike my boring lunchbox, it has a cute shape and it's even wrapped in a pleasantly-colored cloth.[lr]::
53527::$$$message_0463_0005_0002$$$::I'm grateful, and I can count on it tasting good if Sakura made it.::
53528::$$$message_0463_0006_0000$$$::"Mm, thanks... Wait, did you wake up early today just to make this?"[lr]::
53529::$$$message_0463_0006_0001$$$::By the time I came to the living room this morning, Sakura was already finished making breakfast.[lr]::
53530::$$$message_0463_0006_0002$$$::I was impressed at how early she must have gotten up, but it seems that she's even more of an early riser than I thought.::
53531::$$$message_0463_0007_0000$$$::"Yes. I woke up early and didn't have anything else to do, so I thought I'd make you lunch...and, I'd like to ask for your advice."[lr]::
53532::$$$message_0463_0007_0001$$$::"? What's up? Sounds important."::
53533::$$$message_0463_0008_0000$$$::"N-no, not really...![lr]::
53534::$$$message_0463_0008_0001$$$::I don't think so, anyway...but, yeah! I don't see you make lunch to bring to school very often. Why is that, when you like cooking so much?"[lr]::
53535::$$$message_0463_0008_0002$$$::"...Sakura, I don't particularly [font italic=true]enjoy[font italic=false] cooking, you know."::
53536::$$$message_0463_0009_0000$$$::Plus, cooking isn't supposed to be a hobby that guys have. I just happen to be able to do it, and I'd like to leave it at that.[lr]::
53537::$$$message_0463_0009_0001$$$::Anyway, she wants to know why I don't make my own lunch, right...::
53538::$$$message_0463_0010_0000$$$::"I know that it would save money to bring my own lunch, but it makes all the guys in class flock to my desk. Before I know it, half my food is gone."::
53539::$$$message_0463_0011_0000$$$::Sakura nods slowly.[lr]::
53540::$$$message_0463_0011_0001$$$::...It's actually the girls in class who tend to take most of my food, but I decide not to mention it because it makes me sound pathetic.::
53541::$$$message_0463_0012_0000$$$::"Yeah, so that's why I only make lunch on the days I can eat in the student council office. When I'm there, I can eat in private with Issei."::
53542::$$$message_0463_0013_0000$$$::"...U-um, Senpai? What about having lunch at the range?[lr]::
53543::$$$message_0463_0013_0001$$$::The club building's open during the day, you can make tea there, and, um, it's quiet and there's nobody around, so..."::
53544::$$$message_0463_0014_0000$$$::?[lr]::
53545::$$$message_0463_0014_0001$$$::Oh, I never considered that.[lr]::
53546::$$$message_0463_0014_0002$$$::The archery range is unlocked during daytime, and even club members are unlikely to stop by.[lr]::
53547::$$$message_0463_0014_0003$$$::Only Mitsuzuri's likely to be around, if at all, and she isn't rude enough to lay hands on another person's lunch.::
53548::$$$message_0463_0015_0000$$$::"...Okay. Yeah, I think that could work."[lr]::
53549::$$$message_0463_0015_0001$$$::"R-right![lr]::
53550::$$$message_0463_0015_0002$$$::Th-that's an obvious option, isn't it!?"[lr]::
53551::$$$message_0463_0015_0003$$$::"I'm an outsider, though. I'd better get Mitsuzuri's permission first."::
53552::$$$message_0463_0016_0000$$$::"N-no, you'll be fine! It's a school building, and I'm pretty sure students can come and go as they please even outside of club activities!"[lr]::
53553::$$$message_0463_0016_0001$$$::Sakura's being unusually forceful.::
53554::$$$message_0463_0017_0000$$$::"Hmm...well, all right. As long as I'm not imposing on anyone."[lr]::
53555::$$$message_0463_0017_0001$$$::I accept the proposal.[lr]::
53556::$$$message_0463_0017_0002$$$::And for some reason,[lr]::
53557::$$$message_0463_0017_0003$$$::Sakura looks utterly ecstatic, even pumping her fist.::
53558::$$$message_0463_0018_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
53559::$$$message_0463_0018_0001$$$::Hmm...maybe Fuji-nee's good mood rubbed off on her.::
