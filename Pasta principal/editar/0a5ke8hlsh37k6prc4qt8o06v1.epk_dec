65548::$$$message_0603_0000_0001$$$::It's impossible.[lr]::
65549::$$$message_0603_0000_0002$$$::I'm sure the door was locked from the inside when Miss Fujimura entered the room.[lr]::
65550::$$$message_0603_0000_0003$$$::Miss Fujimura, Lady Illya, and I are the only ones in the room.::
65551::$$$message_0603_0000_0004$$$::"But how...!? There isn't anyone else in here!"[lr]::
65552::$$$message_0603_0000_0005$$$::"There are two possibilities.[lr]::
65553::$$$message_0603_0000_0006$$$::One is an accident due to an insufficient affection level.[lr]::
65554::$$$message_0603_0000_0007$$$::The victim, who unfortunately failed to raise Sakura's affection enough in time, mistook the guillotine that Sakura decorated her room with for a bed, and slept in it."::
65555::$$$message_0603_0000_0008$$$::"I see... That doesn't sound very likely, but it's certainly possible.[lr]::
65556::$$$message_0603_0000_0009$$$::Sakura does have tastes like that."[lr]::
65557::$$$message_0603_0000_0010$$$::I see.[lr]::
65558::$$$message_0603_0000_0011$$$::Sakura-chan has some troublesome tastes.[lr]::
65559::$$$message_0603_0000_0012$$$::I never would have expected the bed to suddenly turn into a guillotine as soon as I lied down in it!::
65560::$$$message_0603_0000_0013$$$::"Yeah. The solution would be to start over from Day 9 and raise Sakura's affection level.[lr]::
65561::$$$message_0603_0000_0014$$$::The other way it could have happened is via external intervention.[lr]::
65562::$$$message_0603_0000_0015$$$::Victims can be aggressors, too.[lr]::
65563::$$$message_0603_0000_0016$$$::He tried to kill Sakura, but he triggered the knife-launching crime deterrent in the walls and got smoked!"::
65564::$$$message_0603_0000_0017$$$::"The Mississippi System... Sakura actually thought that far ahead... How fearsome!"::
65565::$$$message_0603_0000_0018$$$::They come up with a heated deduction.[lr]::
65566::$$$message_0603_0000_0019$$$::But then, I realize there's another M.O. they failed to think of.[lr]::
65567::$$$message_0603_0000_0020$$$::It's like this: [lr]::
65568::$$$message_0603_0000_0021$$$::Let us rewind to the morning of the previous day.[lr]::
65569::$$$message_0603_0000_0022$$$::What if my death was set in stone from the moment I answered "no" to Tohsaka's question...?::
65570::$$$message_0603_0000_0023$$$::"Anyway, case closed.[lr]::
65571::$$$message_0603_0000_0024$$$::Let us be off, Madam Illyasviel. The police can handle the rest. We should leave this cursed mansion."[lr]::
65572::$$$message_0603_0000_0025$$$::"...Yes. This case left a rather bad taste in my mouth."::
65573::$$$message_0603_0000_0026$$$::The actors depart.[lr]::
65574::$$$message_0603_0000_0027$$$::Only my corpse remains on the stage.[lr]::
65575::$$$message_0603_0000_0028$$$::   Thus, I conclude: [lr]::
65576::$$$message_0603_0000_0029$$$::Let this be the last time we use this tortured gag in the utterly absurd Tiger Dojo, where nothing ever gets solved with logic.::
