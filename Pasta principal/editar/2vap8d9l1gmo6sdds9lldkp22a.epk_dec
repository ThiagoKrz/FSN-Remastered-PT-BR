58497::$$$message_0524_0000_0000$$$::The lights go out in the house.[lr]::
58498::$$$message_0524_0000_0001$$$::It's past 11:00 PM, and the town is fast asleep.::
58499::$$$message_0524_0001_0000$$$::"There's a Master at Ryudou Temple?"[lr]::
58500::$$$message_0524_0001_0001$$$::"According to Tohsaka, at least. She said not to mess with them because they're trouble, but they're apparently behind the comas happening all over town... I don't know if it's true, but I think it's worth checking out."::
58501::$$$message_0524_0002_0000$$$::"Yes...I do feel that the leylines leading to Ryudou Temple are being deliberately manipulated. There's little doubt that a Master has taken up refuge there."[lr]::
58502::$$$message_0524_0002_0001$$$::"Hm? What's wrong, Saber? Somehow, you don't seem very enthusiastic compared to yesterday."::
58503::$$$message_0524_0003_0000$$$::"Yes. It's best if Servants avoid that mountain.[lr]::
58504::$$$message_0524_0003_0001$$$::I would rather not make a hasty assault on it."::
58505::$$$message_0524_0004_0000$$$::"...Hrm. Then should we hold off patrolling tonight and gather a little more intel on Ryudou Temple? Cause you're right, it would be reckless to go in there without knowing anything about the Servant or Master."::
58506::$$$message_0524_0005_0000$$$::"No, that won't be necessary. A Master who has made Ryudou Temple their base is unlikely to expose themself. If you wish to settle accounts with them quickly, the only way is a frontal assault."::
58507::$$$message_0524_0006_0000$$$::...If Saber says so, then we probably have a chance of victory. I'd also like to stop the Master from putting any more townspeople into comas as soon as possible.::
58508::$$$message_0524_0007_0000$$$::"All right. Let's go to Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
58509::$$$message_0524_0007_0001$$$::But Saber, we're only going there to scout it out.[lr]::
58510::$$$message_0524_0007_0002$$$::Once we learn who the Master is and which Servant they have, we'll fall back... I know it's lame, but I can't back you up out there. I'd rather err on the side of caution."::
58511::$$$message_0524_0008_0000$$$::I can't let Saber get hurt, like that time with Berserker.[lr]::
58512::$$$message_0524_0008_0001$$$::But since I can't help her in a fight, I have to protect her a different way.::
58513::$$$message_0524_0009_0000$$$::"...I understand. I will leave the final decision of whether to fight or retreat up to you."[lr]::
58514::$$$message_0524_0009_0001$$$::"...Mrgh. I'm happy to hear that, but it's scary. Even if the enemy turns out to be someone we can beat, I'm liable to turn tail and run."::
58515::$$$message_0524_0010_0000$$$::"I see. That could indeed happen. You lack combat experience, after all."[lr]::
58516::$$$message_0524_0010_0001$$$::"Yeah, no denying that. I'd like to avoid stepping into a figurative minefield, so I'd appreciate it if you gave me fair warning."::
58517::$$$message_0524_0011_0000$$$::"Very well. Then I will warn you if you make a wrong decision.[lr]::
58518::$$$message_0524_0011_0001$$$::Of course, that alone won't help you grow, so in the event that you do make a mistake, why don't we consider some sort of penalty?"[lr]::
58519::$$$message_0524_0011_0002$$$::"Mrgh. What kind of penalty, specifically?"::
58520::$$$message_0524_0012_0000$$$::"Why, telling you would spoil the surprise. It is one of the few pleasures I have, so I will keep it to myself for now."[lr]::
58521::$$$message_0524_0012_0001$$$::...Urgh.[lr]::
58522::$$$message_0524_0012_0002$$$::Saber seems to be making a joke. Maybe it's Fuji-nee's influence.[lr]::
58523::$$$message_0524_0012_0003$$$::I sure hope it's a joke, anyway.::
58524::$$$message_0524_0013_0000$$$::"However, Shirou...will Sakura be all right? Her discomfort was rather considerable."[lr]::
58525::$$$message_0524_0013_0001$$$::"Yeah, I thought so too. I took her temperature, but her fever wasn't actually that high. I'll just let her get a good night's rest for now and see how she holds up."::
58526::$$$message_0524_0014_0000$$$::"I see. Then we can go to battle without reservations."[lr]::
58527::$$$message_0524_0014_0001$$$::I nod, and look out towards the guesthouse.[lr]::
58528::$$$message_0524_0014_0002$$$::Sakura's room is on the second floor of the building.[lr]::
58529::$$$message_0524_0014_0003$$$::We need to leave and return to the house without her noticing.::
58530::$$$message_0524_0015_0000$$$::"Let's go, Saber. From here on out, I'm a Master. I won't think about anything else."::
58531::$$$message_0524_0016_0000$$$::I leave the house with Saber.[lr]::
58532::$$$message_0524_0016_0001$$$::The moon is high in the sky, and the darkness feels dense, somehow.[lr]::
58533::$$$message_0524_0016_0002$$$::Up above, the clouds move quickly, perhaps due to the wind.[lr]::
58534::$$$message_0524_0016_0003$$$::Under the pale moonlight, peeking and disappearing beneath the clouds, we beat a swift pace to enemy territory.::
