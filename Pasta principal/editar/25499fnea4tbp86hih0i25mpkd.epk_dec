20850::$$$message_0189_0000_0000$$$::"What is the problem? Why do you hesitate? The Grail itself is at stake. It seems a reasonable offer to me."[lr]::
20851::$$$message_0189_0000_0001$$$::The priest's words ring true.[lr]::
20852::$$$message_0189_0000_0002$$$::For her to hesitate now would be the height of hypocrisy.[lr]::
20853::$$$message_0189_0000_0003$$$::Even still...[lr]::
20854::$$$message_0189_0000_0004$$$::[font italic=true]This path...isn't wrong...[font italic=false][lr]::
20855::$$$message_0189_0000_0005$$$::His words refuse to leave her mind.::
20856::$$$message_0189_0001_0000$$$::"I...I..."[lr]::
20857::$$$message_0189_0001_0001$$$::Though it disgusts her, she knows she's nothing like Shirou.[lr]::
20858::$$$message_0189_0001_0002$$$::She wants to upend everything.[lr]::
20859::$$$message_0189_0001_0003$$$::That day, so long ago, there [font italic=true]must[font italic=false] have been someone who would have drawn the sword from the stone and been a better king.[lr]::
20860::$$$message_0189_0001_0004$$$::There must have been someone who could have built a true utopia...::
20861::$$$message_0189_0002_0000$$$::The heart that loved her nation so dearly...[lr]::
20862::$$$message_0189_0002_0001$$$::And the young woman's doubt...before she took the sword.[lr]::
20863::$$$message_0189_0002_0002$$$::On that day...[lr]::
20864::$$$message_0189_0002_0003$$$::She tried to fully and forever abandon her heart the day she drew the sword.[lr]::
20865::$$$message_0189_0002_0004$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20866::$$$message_0189_0002_0005$$$::How did she not realize this before?::
20867::$$$message_0189_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"I can't stray from this path, for all those who were left behind, who laid it."[font italic=false]::
20868::$$$message_0189_0004_0000$$$::To her, that is the girl who loved her country. The girl named Altria, before she was crowned.[lr]::
20869::$$$message_0189_0004_0001$$$::That was not a kingly heart.[lr]::
20870::$$$message_0189_0004_0002$$$::A king could only believe in themselves.[lr]::
20871::$$$message_0189_0004_0003$$$::To deny that would be to deny everything she gave up.[lr]::
20872::$$$message_0189_0004_0004$$$::What is lost cannot be returned.[lr]::
20873::$$$message_0189_0004_0005$$$::Her Master insisted on this, even as he suffered.::
20874::$$$message_0189_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20875::$$$message_0189_0005_0001$$$::His pained expression alone makes her heart ache.[lr]::
20876::$$$message_0189_0005_0002$$$::What was it she had said?[lr]::
20877::$$$message_0189_0005_0003$$$::She could not start over.[lr]::
20878::$$$message_0189_0005_0004$$$::It was her duty as the king. So she refused, over and over.::
20879::$$$message_0189_0006_0000$$$::What duty?[lr]::
20880::$$$message_0189_0006_0001$$$::To resurrect her lost nation?[lr]::
20881::$$$message_0189_0006_0002$$$::To select a more capable king?[lr]::
20882::$$$message_0189_0006_0003$$$::Or is it...to wish for all the death and destruction to have never happened to begin with?::
20883::$$$message_0189_0007_0000$$$::"...No, that isn't right."[lr]::
20884::$$$message_0189_0007_0001$$$::That was a mistake.[lr]::
20885::$$$message_0189_0007_0002$$$::She was raised to be king. That is how she lived.[lr]::
20886::$$$message_0189_0007_0003$$$::In that, there was no flaw.[lr]::
20887::$$$message_0189_0007_0004$$$::But if that led to ruination, why could she not accept it?[lr]::
20888::$$$message_0189_0007_0005$$$::She had no regrets.[lr]::
20889::$$$message_0189_0007_0006$$$::If she could take pride in the way she lived her life, wishing for another chance was a pointless waste.::
20890::$$$message_0189_0008_0000$$$::"...I see it now, Shirou."[lr]::
20891::$$$message_0189_0008_0001$$$::And so his anguished cries finally reach her heart.[lr]::
20892::$$$message_0189_0008_0002$$$::All the tears.[lr]::
20893::$$$message_0189_0008_0003$$$::All the pain.[lr]::
20894::$$$message_0189_0008_0004$$$::Even her broken heart.[lr]::
20895::$$$message_0189_0008_0005$$$::Salvation could come from destroying all of it.[lr]::
20896::$$$message_0189_0008_0006$$$::But...[lr]::
20897::$$$message_0189_0008_0007$$$::[font italic=true]If it was undone, what would happen to everything swept aside in the undoing?[font italic=false] ::
20898::$$$message_0189_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]I have stolen much from many. Even their very lives.[font italic=false] [lr]::
20899::$$$message_0189_0009_0001$$$::[font italic=true]All that pain and regret is mine to bear. It belongs to me.[font italic=false] [lr]::
20900::$$$message_0189_0009_0002$$$::[font italic=true]If I were to wish for a chance at something, it should be for a miracle in the here and now, not to upend the past.[font italic=false] [lr]::
20901::$$$message_0189_0009_0003$$$::[font italic=true]Each of the countless paths not taken before...[font italic=false] [lr]::
20902::$$$message_0189_0009_0004$$$::[font italic=true]...cannot be taken by sacrificing this one. Instead, I should forge ahead and work to fulfill what hopes have yet to come true even to this day.[font italic=false] ::
20903::$$$message_0189_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20904::$$$message_0189_0010_0001$$$::If she is nationless and uncrowned now...[lr]::
20905::$$$message_0189_0010_0002$$$::...perhaps her wish should be for herself[line2]::
20906::$$$message_0189_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]No.[font italic=false][lr]::
20907::$$$message_0189_0011_0001$$$::She could not make a wish like that, either.[lr]::
20908::$$$message_0189_0011_0002$$$::She chose to take up the crown.[lr]::
20909::$$$message_0189_0011_0003$$$::She never suffered for that decision. Not once.[lr]::
20910::$$$message_0189_0011_0004$$$::Even if no one ever understood or accepted her...[lr]::
20911::$$$message_0189_0011_0005$$$::That choice itself was her pride and joy.[lr]::
20912::$$$message_0189_0011_0006$$$::At the very least...[lr]::
20913::$$$message_0189_0011_0007$$$::She truly believed that when she drew the sword from the stone.::
20914::$$$message_0189_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]That[font italic=false] is her answer.[lr]::
20915::$$$message_0189_0012_0001$$$::Just as he found something to stand by, so too has she.::
20916::$$$message_0189_0013_0000$$$::"Yes..."[lr]::
20917::$$$message_0189_0013_0001$$$::She pledged once, so long ago...[lr]::
20918::$$$message_0189_0013_0002$$$::Something she swore to herself.[lr]::
20919::$$$message_0189_0013_0003$$$::She would fight.[lr]::
20920::$$$message_0189_0013_0004$$$::Even if she loses everything...even if everyone in the world hates her.[lr]::
20921::$$$message_0189_0013_0005$$$::"...I was so foolish..."[lr]::
20922::$$$message_0189_0013_0006$$$::An oath from a king. A promise to fight against all odds.::
20923::$$$message_0189_0014_0000$$$::And so the king protected her country.[lr]::
20924::$$$message_0189_0014_0001$$$::But the country did not protect the king.[lr]::
20925::$$$message_0189_0014_0002$$$::And so it was. The ending may have been tragic, but if she is no longer ashamed of the path that led there...::
20926::$$$message_0189_0015_0000$$$::"I should never have pursued that wish."[lr]::
20927::$$$message_0189_0015_0001$$$::She fulfilled her duty as king.[lr]::
20928::$$$message_0189_0015_0002$$$::It led to ruin, but she saw everything through to the end.[lr]::
20929::$$$message_0189_0015_0003$$$::There need be nothing else.::
20930::$$$message_0189_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]Of course.[font italic=false][lr]::
20931::$$$message_0189_0016_0001$$$::[font italic=true]I did not want everything.[font italic=false][lr]::
20932::$$$message_0189_0016_0002$$$::[font italic=true]The only thing I ever wanted from the very start...[font italic=false][lr]::
20933::$$$message_0189_0016_0003$$$::[font italic=true]I did until the very end, even if it meant losing so much along the way.[font italic=false][lr]::
20934::$$$message_0189_0016_0004$$$::[font italic=true]I will keep this unobtainable dream deep within my heart...[font italic=false][lr]::
20935::$$$message_0189_0016_0005$$$::[font italic=true]...and it may now end.[font italic=false]::
20936::$$$message_0189_0017_0000$$$::"...I do desire the Holy Grail. But I cannot kill Shirou."[lr]::
20937::$$$message_0189_0017_0001$$$::She turns her sword on her enemy.[lr]::
20938::$$$message_0189_0017_0002$$$::"...What?"[lr]::
20939::$$$message_0189_0017_0003$$$::"Do you not understand, fool? Shirou is more important to me."::
20940::$$$message_0189_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]And that is why my role is set.[font italic=false][lr]::
20941::$$$message_0189_0018_0001$$$::[font italic=true]I will be his sword. I will shield him from danger.[font italic=false][lr]::
20942::$$$message_0189_0018_0002$$$::All hesitation leaves her.::
20943::$$$message_0189_0019_0000$$$::"...You are saying you do not want the Grail?"[lr]::
20944::$$$message_0189_0019_0001$$$::"If the Holy Grail will stain me, I do not want it. I already have everything I want."::
20945::$$$message_0189_0020_0000$$$::Yes. She has everything she needs with her now.[lr]::
20946::$$$message_0189_0020_0001$$$::Her pride as a knight. Her promise as a king.[lr]::
20947::$$$message_0189_0020_0002$$$::Even the precious dream that young girl once held...::
20948::$$$message_0189_0021_0000$$$::Those words... Those words I [font italic=true]do[font italic=false] hear.[lr]::
20949::$$$message_0189_0021_0001$$$::The girl who professed that her only goal was claiming the Holy Grail...[lr]::
20950::$$$message_0189_0021_0002$$$::...now says she has no need of such a thing.::
20951::$$$message_0189_0022_0000$$$::"Sa...ber..."[lr]::
20952::$$$message_0189_0022_0001$$$::I call out to her as loudly as I can between ragged breaths.[lr]::
20953::$$$message_0189_0022_0002$$$::My vision still hasn't cleared, but I can still make out her presence.[lr]::
20954::$$$message_0189_0022_0003$$$::The pain is fading.[lr]::
20955::$$$message_0189_0022_0004$$$::My wound, which wouldn't close, begins to heal. Is it because she's close?::
20956::$$$message_0189_0023_0000$$$::"Can you stand, Shirou? If you can, please take my hand."[lr]::
20957::$$$message_0189_0023_0001$$$::"...Yeah...I can do that..."[lr]::
20958::$$$message_0189_0023_0002$$$::I take her hand.[lr]::
20959::$$$message_0189_0023_0003$$$::[font italic=true]Whoa...[font italic=false][lr]::
20960::$$$message_0189_0023_0004$$$::My vision returns.[lr]::
20961::$$$message_0189_0023_0005$$$::My head, so fuzzy from blood loss, rapidly regains focus.::
20962::$$$message_0189_0024_0000$$$::"...Saber...is this your...?"[lr]::
20963::$$$message_0189_0024_0001$$$::"Yes. It can negate even the curse of Gáe Bolg. Stay close to me, and you will heal completely.[lr]::
20964::$$$message_0189_0024_0002$$$::We must press on, though..."::
20965::$$$message_0189_0025_0000$$$::Saber turns her gaze back to the underground sanctuary.[lr]::
20966::$$$message_0189_0025_0001$$$::Beyond the door...[lr]::
20967::$$$message_0189_0025_0002$$$::...the last Master, Kirei Kotomine, stands at the threshold to the room. Beyond him is Lancer.::
20968::$$$message_0189_0026_0000$$$::"I see."[lr]::
20969::$$$message_0189_0026_0001$$$::He looks at us strangely, as if seeing us for the first time.[lr]::
20970::$$$message_0189_0026_0002$$$::"How dull."[lr]::
20971::$$$message_0189_0026_0003$$$::The disappointment in his voice is palpable.::
20972::$$$message_0189_0027_0000$$$::"It appears the Holy Grail is mine, then.[lr]::
20973::$$$message_0189_0027_0001$$$::...But that will be rather violent.[lr]::
20974::$$$message_0189_0027_0002$$$::If my wish is to be granted, it will require a completed Grail. Regretfully, I must kill you here, Shirou Emiya."::
20975::$$$message_0189_0028_0000$$$::"Hn!"[lr]::
20976::$$$message_0189_0028_0001$$$::I try my best to brace myself, but my body still won't listen.[lr]::
20977::$$$message_0189_0028_0002$$$::Even with Saber's hand in mine it's all I can do just to stand.[lr]::
20978::$$$message_0189_0028_0003$$$::I can't possibly fight, so I'll only be a burden to Saber[line2]::
20979::$$$message_0189_0029_0000$$$::"Do not concern yourself with this. I will handle it. Please just stay here."[lr]::
20980::$$$message_0189_0029_0001$$$::"Such confidence. What say you, Lancer? Do you think it would be wise for us to flee?"::
20981::$$$message_0189_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20982::$$$message_0189_0030_0001$$$::Lancer is silent.[lr]::
20983::$$$message_0189_0030_0002$$$::Of course, Kotomine doesn't actually sound at all worried.[lr]::
20984::$$$message_0189_0030_0003$$$::He's just making a show of it. ::
20985::$$$message_0189_0031_0000$$$::"Kotomine. Before I cut you down, I will ask, what exactly do you hope to gain? What is your wish, Overseer?"::
20986::$$$message_0189_0032_0000$$$::"...In a word, 'entertainment.' But I am in no rush.[lr]::
20987::$$$message_0189_0032_0001$$$::To be honest, I have little interest in the Grail itself. But that is fine. If none prove worthy, I will take it, for the sake of the world itself."::
20988::$$$message_0189_0033_0000$$$::"You must think me a fool. You slay a Master to become one yourself, but claim innocence? You intended to pursue the Holy Grail from the start."::
20989::$$$message_0189_0034_0000$$$::"You jest, but it is the truth. I came to this situation by happenstance. Lancer's Master had to die. Outsiders are trouble. I would not want them to discover the Grail's nature. So I was forced to retire that Master early. Still, it would not have been wise to eliminate the Servant at that stage.[lr]::
20990::$$$message_0189_0034_0001$$$::I needed a pawn to hasten the war's conclusion, so I borrowed that Master's rights to Lancer."::
20991::$$$message_0189_0035_0000$$$::The hell? Kotomine became a Master by killing Lancer's!?::
20992::$$$message_0189_0036_0000$$$::"...I see. Then I need no further information from you.[lr]::
20993::$$$message_0189_0036_0001$$$::I would, however, have you fulfill your duty, Overseer. Where is the vessel? Where is the heart of this war?"[lr]::
20994::$$$message_0189_0036_0002$$$::"What? Did you not realize you had it to begin with...?"::
20995::$$$message_0189_0037_0000$$$::He actually gasps.[lr]::
20996::$$$message_0189_0037_0001$$$::The brief moment of surprise passes quickly.[lr]::
20997::$$$message_0189_0037_0002$$$::With a smirk, he snaps his fingers to introduce the final piece of the puzzle.::
20998::$$$message_0189_0038_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
20999::$$$message_0189_0038_0001$$$::Both Saber and Lancer tense.[lr]::
21000::$$$message_0189_0038_0002$$$::Heavy footsteps echo from above.::
21001::$$$message_0189_0039_0000$$$::"I suppose it is hardly necessary any longer, but let me introduce you. This is the Servant, Archer. He is the Heroic Spirit I partnered with in the previous Holy Grail War."[lr]::
21002::$$$message_0189_0039_0001$$$::The golden figure makes his appearance.[lr]::
21003::$$$message_0189_0039_0002$$$::Gilgamesh, King of Heroes.::
21004::$$$message_0189_0040_0000$$$::The atmosphere shifts.[lr]::
21005::$$$message_0189_0040_0001$$$::After making his sudden appearance, Gilgamesh crosses the sanctuary grounds to stand beside Kotomine.::
21006::$$$message_0189_0041_0000$$$::"...So? What are your plans now, Kotomine? Are we settling the score with these worms here?[lr]::
21007::$$$message_0189_0041_0001$$$::This is rather an underwhelming venue."::
21008::$$$message_0189_0042_0000$$$::"Please, do not say that. This did not conform to my expectations either. Forgive me. Allow me to address all your complaints later."::
21009::$$$message_0189_0043_0000$$$::"All right, as long as you understand.[lr]::
21010::$$$message_0189_0043_0001$$$::But do something about this primitive, would you? If he continues to fix his ugly little gaze on me, I may be forced to kill him."::
21011::$$$message_0189_0044_0000$$$::"The hell is this, Kotomine? That guy's your Servant...?"::
21012::$$$message_0189_0045_0000$$$::"Ah, yes, I have not explained everything to you. He is my Servant from the previous war. We had a mutual understanding at its conclusion. [lr]::
21013::$$$message_0189_0045_0001$$$::As he felt following me was acceptable, and I prepared suitable sustenance for him to remain, we have been content to continue our cooperation."[lr]::
21014::$$$message_0189_0045_0002$$$::"So that's why you keep that disgusting room. And why didn't you tell me about this?"::
21015::$$$message_0189_0046_0000$$$::"What would have been the point? Did you want to partner with him for your tasks?"[lr]::
21016::$$$message_0189_0046_0001$$$::"Hell no. I'd rather die than work with him."[lr]::
21017::$$$message_0189_0046_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
21018::$$$message_0189_0047_0000$$$::...And now there are three of them.[lr]::
21019::$$$message_0189_0047_0001$$$::Lancer by the stairs. Gilgamesh in the center of the sanctuary.::
21020::$$$message_0189_0048_0000$$$::"Gh."[lr]::
21021::$$$message_0189_0048_0001$$$::We can't beat them all.[lr]::
21022::$$$message_0189_0048_0002$$$::Gilgamesh is too much for us on his own. But we can't escape with Lancer around, either.::
21023::$$$message_0189_0049_0000$$$::"Kotomine, you said you didn't know about him..."[lr]::
21024::$$$message_0189_0049_0001$$$::"Please. I am a priest. I do not lie."[lr]::
21025::$$$message_0189_0049_0002$$$::"Huh? You're lying! You said you couldn't ignore a Servant from the previous war!" ::
21026::$$$message_0189_0050_0000$$$::"Correct. I was, in fact, surprised at the time as well. I had intended for Archer to remain here, but he still went out to do battle with you.[lr]::
21027::$$$message_0189_0050_0001$$$::Should you have been the one to investigate Archer, you would have discovered all this. As such, I was forced to make plans. So, you see, I did not lie."::
21028::$$$message_0189_0051_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
21029::$$$message_0189_0051_0001$$$::God dammit![lr]::
21030::$$$message_0189_0051_0002$$$::I blundered right into the enemy's stronghold because I trusted his word!::
21031::$$$message_0189_0052_0000$$$::"...Then you are Archer's Master?"[lr]::
21032::$$$message_0189_0052_0001$$$::"Correct. It feels like a renewal of the war from ten years ago, yes?[lr]::
21033::$$$message_0189_0052_0002$$$::I was obviously unable to witness the final moments after Kiritsugu defeated me. This shall be the second[line2]and final[line2]time I face you."::
21034::$$$message_0189_0053_0000$$$::"Answer me: How and why does Archer remain? What caused the fire? And how are you alive after Kiritsugu defeated you!?"[lr]::
21035::$$$message_0189_0053_0001$$$::Saber's voice drips with venom.[lr]::
21036::$$$message_0189_0053_0002$$$::These questions must have been weighing on her for a while now.[lr]::
21037::$$$message_0189_0053_0003$$$::She must also want clarity about what she left behind ten years ago and the disaster that followed.::
21038::$$$message_0189_0054_0000$$$::"There should be no question.[lr]::
21039::$$$message_0189_0054_0001$$$::Ten years ago, the Grail was incomplete, yet filled with power. It was within reach.[lr]::
21040::$$$message_0189_0054_0002$$$::So I touched it. You and Kiritsugu proved too strong and I wished for a diversion to separate the both of you. What ensued shocked even me."::
21041::$$$message_0189_0055_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21042::$$$message_0189_0055_0001$$$::Wait.[lr]::
21043::$$$message_0189_0055_0002$$$::That means...::
21044::$$$message_0189_0056_0000$$$::"...You caused the fire with the Grail!?"::
21045::$$$message_0189_0057_0000$$$::"Perhaps. Had I been someone else, the Grail may still have done the same, or at least something similar. That is in its nature. It is called the omnipotent chalice, but only blood, darkness, and curses fill it.[lr]::
21046::$$$message_0189_0057_0001$$$::Did you not witness that as well? What emerged when you destroyed the vessel bathed Archer in its darkness. Perhaps he would not have become lost in this world had you not destroyed the Grail."::
21047::$$$message_0189_0058_0000$$$::"Cease your drivel. The Holy Grail is a wish-granting vessel. It grants the wishes of the one to possess it, so you must have wished for that fire...!"::
21048::$$$message_0189_0059_0000$$$::"I only wished for what resulted. I had no such designs on the process by which it happened. I merely desired that everyone be gone from that place.[lr]::
21049::$$$message_0189_0059_0001$$$::You, on the other hand, seem to be lacking in imagination.[lr]::
21050::$$$message_0189_0059_0002$$$::Grant wishes? Certainly. But how will a wish be granted? Did you expect the world to change instantly?"::
21051::$$$message_0189_0060_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21052::$$$message_0189_0060_0001$$$::"I do not know what the original Holy Grail might have been, but [font italic=true]this[font italic=false] one is merely concentrated power.[lr]::
21053::$$$message_0189_0060_0002$$$::It is incapable of calculations or corrections. It is simply a power source.[lr]::
21054::$$$message_0189_0060_0003$$$::Think of it like a weapon. If the one who possesses it wishes for riches, it will kill all around them, thus granting its possessor their riches[line2]their wish."::
21055::$$$message_0189_0061_0000$$$::"Do you understand? It is a defective vessel that can only grant wishes through destruction."[lr]::
21056::$$$message_0189_0061_0001$$$::"Wha[line2]That is not what was promised...![lr]::
21057::$$$message_0189_0061_0002$$$::The Grail is supposed to grant any wish to the one who possesses it!"::
21058::$$$message_0189_0062_0000$$$::"And so it does. The Grail's methodology, though, is brutally practical, I daresay.[lr]::
21059::$$$message_0189_0062_0001$$$::Sometimes, for one to live, another must die.[lr]::
21060::$$$message_0189_0062_0002$$$::Such equivalent exchange can be found all over the world. A miracle would require a means by which to make itself possible.[lr]::
21061::$$$message_0189_0062_0003$$$::A wish does not come true if one is concerned about things like equity.[lr]::
21062::$$$message_0189_0062_0004$$$::To enact such a paradigm shift would require the sacking of that which is lesser. An alteration via the most efficient method." ::
21063::$$$message_0189_0063_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21064::$$$message_0189_0063_0001$$$::I can only imagine what Saber must feel.[lr]::
21065::$$$message_0189_0063_0002$$$::If what Kotomine says is true, this is not the Grail she wanted.::
21066::$$$message_0189_0064_0000$$$::It's merely power to fuel the possessor's wish.[lr]::
21067::$$$message_0189_0064_0001$$$::It grants its owner's wish, at the cost of everything else.[lr]::
21068::$$$message_0189_0064_0002$$$::So that is the true face of this supposedly omnipotent power.::
21069::$$$message_0189_0065_0000$$$::"Then...the Grail..."[lr]::
21070::$$$message_0189_0065_0001$$$::"It is a tainted vessel that destroys all but its bearer.[lr]::
21071::$$$message_0189_0065_0002$$$::You will understand once you lay eyes upon it. It is truly a curse given form."::
21072::$$$message_0189_0066_0000$$$::"And that...is a delight to my ears.[lr]::
21073::$$$message_0189_0066_0001$$$::To touch the Holy Grail is a dream for a man of the cloth such as myself. But this Grail would kill everything and everyone. To hold such power in my hands would be a dream come true."::
21074::$$$message_0189_0067_0000$$$::The priest laughs.[lr]::
21075::$$$message_0189_0067_0001$$$::This time, it's not for show.[lr]::
21076::$$$message_0189_0067_0002$$$::He laughs in pure delight.[lr]::
21077::$$$message_0189_0067_0003$$$::It makes me realize...[lr]::
21078::$$$message_0189_0067_0004$$$::This is a man entirely without humanity.[lr]::
21079::$$$message_0189_0067_0005$$$::More than anyone else, he absolutely [font italic=true]cannot[font italic=false] get the Grail.::
21080::$$$message_0189_0068_0000$$$::"...Farewell, then.[lr]::
21081::$$$message_0189_0068_0001$$$::See to this garbage. Lancer, kill the boy. Archer, defeat Saber."::
21082::$$$message_0189_0069_0000$$$::The priest turns on his heel and ascends the stairs.[lr]::
21083::$$$message_0189_0069_0001$$$::All that remains are me, who can barely move from my injuries, Kotomine's two Servants...[lr]::
21084::$$$message_0189_0069_0002$$$::...and Saber, standing ready to guard me, glaring at our enemies.::
21085::$$$message_0189_0070_0000$$$::A tense moment passes.[lr]::
21086::$$$message_0189_0070_0001$$$::We need to beat Gilgamesh and Lancer if we're going to have any hope of getting back to the surface.[lr]::
21087::$$$message_0189_0070_0002$$$::But I don't care about defeating them.[lr]::
21088::$$$message_0189_0070_0003$$$::If we could regroup somehow, maybe, but[line2]::
21089::$$$message_0189_0071_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
21090::$$$message_0189_0071_0001$$$::Saber's voice is quiet, but her eyes never leave the enemy.[lr]::
21091::$$$message_0189_0071_0002$$$::"I know I am asking much of you, but stay by my side at all costs."[lr]::
21092::$$$message_0189_0071_0003$$$::She grips my hand firmly in her own.[lr]::
21093::$$$message_0189_0071_0004$$$::I can tell she's ready to go at any moment.::
21094::$$$message_0189_0072_0000$$$::"All right. I'll do my best to follow you, so don't worry about me."[lr]::
21095::$$$message_0189_0072_0001$$$::I nod back.[lr]::
21096::$$$message_0189_0072_0002$$$::I can barely walk.[lr]::
21097::$$$message_0189_0072_0003$$$::We both understand just how bad this is.[lr]::
21098::$$$message_0189_0072_0004$$$::But Saber is telling me she will do everything she can to get me through this.[lr]::
21099::$$$message_0189_0072_0005$$$::What can I do but agree?::
21100::$$$message_0189_0073_0000$$$::"I have full confidence in you."[lr]::
21101::$$$message_0189_0073_0001$$$::Her voice is quiet but firm.[lr]::
21102::$$$message_0189_0073_0002$$$::"...Now!"[lr]::
21103::$$$message_0189_0073_0003$$$::At that moment, she lets go of my hand to charge ahead.::
21104::$$$message_0189_0074_0000$$$::Both shadows react to her in an instant.[lr]::
21105::$$$message_0189_0074_0001$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
21106::$$$message_0189_0074_0002$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
21107::$$$message_0189_0074_0003$$$::Saber and I are struck dumb.::
21108::$$$message_0189_0075_0000$$$::[font italic=true]What just happened?[font italic=false][lr]::
21109::$$$message_0189_0075_0001$$$::Lancer jerks his spear off course, away from me...and straight for Gilgamesh, who bats the attack aside with a longsword as if he'd expected it.::
21110::$$$message_0189_0076_0000$$$::"Ah, missed. My bad."[lr]::
21111::$$$message_0189_0076_0001$$$::"Ah. Your accuracy certainly leaves something to be desired."[lr]::
21112::$$$message_0189_0076_0002$$$::Both men withdraw, unhurried and unconcerned.::
21113::$$$message_0189_0077_0000$$$::"Let me remind you: the mongrel is yours. Saber is mine to deal with, right?"[lr]::
21114::$$$message_0189_0077_0001$$$::"My bad, but I don't really care anymore. He didn't give the order with a Command Spell so he can choke for all I care."[lr]::
21115::$$$message_0189_0077_0002$$$::As he says this,[lr]::
21116::$$$message_0189_0077_0003$$$::Lancer turns to face Gilgamesh, almost as if protecting us.::
21117::$$$message_0189_0078_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]Lancer, you[line2]"[lr]::
21118::$$$message_0189_0078_0001$$$::"If you're gonna say something stupid, save your breath. This isn't me helping you. I'm just sticking to my own code."[lr]::
21119::$$$message_0189_0078_0002$$$::Lancer levels his spear at Gilgamesh.[lr]::
21120::$$$message_0189_0078_0003$$$::His intent is clear: he actually does mean to let us go.::
21121::$$$message_0189_0079_0000$$$::"Honestly, I've had it up to here with him anyway. I'm not doing what he says anymore. I'm cutting Kotomine off right here."[lr]::
21122::$$$message_0189_0079_0001$$$::"Oh? You're breaking your contract with him? So you're willing to be eliminated here and now, even with the Grail in reach?"::
21123::$$$message_0189_0080_0000$$$::"I'm nothing like you. I couldn't give less of a shit about having a second life or whatever... No hero worth a damn would care that much for such a thing.[lr]::
21124::$$$message_0189_0080_0001$$$::We've got no attachments to this world. Heroes really only care about promises left unfulfilled.[lr]::
21125::$$$message_0189_0080_0002$$$::Not that I expect a greedy jackass like you to understand that."::
21126::$$$message_0189_0081_0000$$$::"Is that so? One who experienced such a radiant end must speak thusly. And I suppose this betrayal is owed to a hero's pride as well?[lr]::
21127::$$$message_0189_0081_0001$$$::You certainly chose a difficult code to live up to, Lancer."[lr]::
21128::$$$message_0189_0081_0002$$$::The air behind Gilgamesh warps.[lr]::
21129::$$$message_0189_0081_0003$$$::Weapons appear out of nowhere in the space behind him.::
21130::$$$message_0189_0082_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21131::$$$message_0189_0082_0001$$$::"Lancer, he possesses the originals of Noble Phantasms. He is the King of Heroes, the man whose story is the oldest ever recorded. Even you cannot defeat him..."::
21132::$$$message_0189_0083_0000$$$::"Damn. A guy who'd destroy his own country to do whatever the hell he wanted... No wonder he's so full of it."::
21133::$$$message_0189_0084_0000$$$::"Lancer, this is no time for bravado[line2]"[lr]::
21134::$$$message_0189_0084_0001$$$::"Oh, shut it. You ain't the boss of me. Me defending you here isn't the same as me siding with you.[lr]::
21135::$$$message_0189_0084_0002$$$::Man, this is why I can't stand you chivalrous types."::
21136::$$$message_0189_0085_0000$$$::In his own way, Lancer's urging Saber to run.[lr]::
21137::$$$message_0189_0085_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21138::$$$message_0189_0085_0002$$$::Saber hangs her head for a moment.[lr]::
21139::$$$message_0189_0085_0003$$$::"Then farewell. I will return the favor if I can."[lr]::
21140::$$$message_0189_0085_0004$$$::Taking my hand, she makes for the stairs.::
21141::$$$message_0189_0086_0000$$$::"Oh, darn. It seems I let them go."[lr]::
21142::$$$message_0189_0086_0001$$$::Gilgamesh just watches us, making no move to follow.::
21143::$$$message_0189_0087_0000$$$::"Eh? Wasn't Saber yours?"[lr]::
21144::$$$message_0189_0087_0001$$$::"Frankly, the command I was given did not suit me. Had you not done as you have here, I might have done so in your stead."::
21145::$$$message_0189_0088_0000$$$::We make it up the stairs.[lr]::
21146::$$$message_0189_0088_0001$$$::Saber must still be worried about how I'm doing, as we don't move very fast.[lr]::
21147::$$$message_0189_0088_0002$$$::The pain, on the other hand, doesn't much care how slowly we're moving, as it doesn't dull in the slightest.[lr]::
21148::$$$message_0189_0088_0003$$$::The rising tension and sense of impending violence grows.::
21149::$$$message_0189_0089_0000$$$::"What's that? You wanted to let Saber go?"::
21150::$$$message_0189_0090_0000$$$::"Of course. I had no intention of killing her. She's mine.[lr]::
21151::$$$message_0189_0090_0001$$$::However, I suppose I can't wait about idly if I want the Grail.[lr]::
21152::$$$message_0189_0090_0002$$$::I need but one more Servant to die for a complete ritual."::
21153::$$$message_0189_0091_0000$$$::A multitude of swords appears in the darkened basement.[lr]::
21154::$$$message_0189_0091_0001$$$::The golden knight smirks.[lr]::
21155::$$$message_0189_0091_0002$$$::This was why he was ready for Lancer's surprise attack.[lr]::
21156::$$$message_0189_0091_0003$$$::Lancer wasn't the only one planning to turn on his would-be ally.::
21157::$$$message_0189_0092_0000$$$::"Well, shit. So you planned this from the get-go."[lr]::
21158::$$$message_0189_0092_0001$$$::"Did you not hear me? We are, I suppose, of like mind in this situation.[lr]::
21159::$$$message_0189_0092_0002$$$::I offer my acknowledgement, Cú Chulainn. You have scripted the most pleasant of circumstances."[lr]::
21160::$$$message_0189_0092_0003$$$::The two come together.[lr]::
21161::$$$message_0189_0092_0004$$$::We make it out just before I see the initial volley.::
