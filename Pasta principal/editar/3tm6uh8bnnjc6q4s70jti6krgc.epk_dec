18330::$$$message_0170_0000_0000$$$::I step into the darkness.::
18331::$$$message_0170_0001_0000$$$::It's a room made of stone.[lr]::
18332::$$$message_0170_0001_0001$$$::The lights are out, but the room itself feels like it's alive, and a faint blue light suffuses the whole place.[lr]::
18333::$$$message_0170_0001_0002$$$::"There's a sanctuary...underground...?"[lr]::
18334::$$$message_0170_0001_0003$$$::No dust or cobwebs anywhere. It looks like this place sees a lot of use.::
18335::$$$message_0170_0002_0000$$$::I'm not sure how far back it goes.[lr]::
18336::$$$message_0170_0002_0001$$$::I look back up the stairs I just came down.[lr]::
18337::$$$message_0170_0002_0002$$$::The staircase hugs a curved wall.[lr]::
18338::$$$message_0170_0002_0003$$$::After descending the curved stairs, I look up and see the entrance is about ten meters above me now.::
18339::$$$message_0170_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18340::$$$message_0170_0003_0001$$$::Maybe it's the absence of light...[lr]::
18341::$$$message_0170_0003_0002$$$::...but the gently curving staircase puts me in mind of a centipede crawling its way through the cathedral.::
18342::$$$message_0170_0004_0000$$$::"Hm...?"[lr]::
18343::$$$message_0170_0004_0001$$$::And then I notice a door.[lr]::
18344::$$$message_0170_0004_0002$$$::It's right at the bottom of the stairs.[lr]::
18345::$$$message_0170_0004_0003$$$::There's a symbol on the wall. Beyond it, a deep darkness beckons me.::
18346::$$$message_0170_0005_0000$$$::Almost as if it were drawing me in, I find myself stepping into the darkness.[lr]::
18347::$$$message_0170_0005_0001$$$::I step through what seems like an entrance of some kind.[lr]::
18348::$$$message_0170_0005_0002$$$::It's...damp.[lr]::
18349::$$$message_0170_0005_0003$$$::The floor's all slimy and it's hard to walk.[lr]::
18350::$$$message_0170_0005_0004$$$::It reminds me of when I was cleaning the school pool.[lr]::
18351::$$$message_0170_0005_0005$$$::Moss covers the entire floor, and it feels like my feet are sinking to the ankles into some kind of rot covering the floor.::
18352::$$$message_0170_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18353::$$$message_0170_0006_0001$$$::I stop suddenly.[lr]::
18354::$$$message_0170_0006_0002$$$::The nasty sensation beneath my feet is bad enough, but now there's a horrible stench.::
18355::$$$message_0170_0007_0000$$$::I pinch my nose shut.[lr]::
18356::$$$message_0170_0007_0001$$$::This isn't some temporary odor. It's permeated the whole room.[lr]::
18357::$$$message_0170_0007_0002$$$::It doesn't smell like fish.[lr]::
18358::$$$message_0170_0007_0003$$$::Or gunpowder.[lr]::
18359::$$$message_0170_0007_0004$$$::It smells like...formaldehyde.[lr]::
18360::$$$message_0170_0007_0005$$$::The chemical reek of it has stagnated in the room like thick mud.::
18361::$$$message_0170_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18362::$$$message_0170_0008_0001$$$::My senses seem to have been numbed from the moment I got into the basement.[lr]::
18363::$$$message_0170_0008_0002$$$::I'm long past tension and nervousness.::
18364::$$$message_0170_0009_0000$$$::   And yet...[lr]::
18365::$$$message_0170_0009_0001$$$::My heart expands and contracts without a break, and my limbs are moving so weirdly it feels like I might wrench out every nerve in my body.[lr]::
18366::$$$message_0170_0009_0002$$$::And what's worse...[lr]::
18367::$$$message_0170_0009_0003$$$::My eyes have grown accustomed to the darkness.::
18368::$$$message_0170_0010_0000$$$::   The darkness fades.[lr]::
18369::$$$message_0170_0010_0001$$$::I hear drops of water falling.[lr]::
18370::$$$message_0170_0010_0002$$$::It's almost like that serves as the starting bell.[lr]::
18371::$$$message_0170_0010_0003$$$::What I couldn't see before is suddenly clear.::
18372::$$$message_0170_0011_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
18373::$$$message_0170_0011_0001$$$::What I see...[lr]::
18374::$$$message_0170_0011_0002$$$::...is an all-too-familiar living hell.::
18375::$$$message_0170_0012_0000$$$::Death lined up, all in a row.[lr]::
18376::$$$message_0170_0012_0001$$$::Debris is piled everywhere.[lr]::
18377::$$$message_0170_0012_0002$$$::The stench of death, covered by antiseptics.::
18378::$$$message_0170_0013_0000$$$::"Ah...ah."[lr]::
18379::$$$message_0170_0013_0001$$$::I thought this was all a lie.[lr]::
18380::$$$message_0170_0013_0002$$$::I want to believe none of this is real.[lr]::
18381::$$$message_0170_0013_0003$$$::But I can't deceive myself.[lr]::
18382::$$$message_0170_0013_0004$$$::I can tell in an instant.[lr]::
18383::$$$message_0170_0013_0005$$$::Even in a room so full of corpses...[lr]::
18384::$$$message_0170_0013_0006$$$::...not one of the bodies here is truly dead.::
18385::$$$message_0170_0014_0000$$$::"They're...alive."[lr]::
18386::$$$message_0170_0014_0001$$$::They're all alive.[lr]::
18387::$$$message_0170_0014_0002$$$::These...corpses[line2]they can [font italic=true]only[font italic=false] be called corpses, however human they once were[line2]are all alive.::
18388::$$$message_0170_0015_0000$$$::"...Ah."[lr]::
18389::$$$message_0170_0015_0001$$$::Why are they still alive? [font italic=true]How[font italic=false] are they still alive?[lr]::
18390::$$$message_0170_0015_0002$$$::I look over each and every body.[lr]::
18391::$$$message_0170_0015_0003$$$::Not one of them has retained their original form.[lr]::
18392::$$$message_0170_0015_0004$$$::Imagining what happened to every one of these sacrilegious forms is just too terrifying. They're more like the husks of dead trees than corpses.[lr]::
18393::$$$message_0170_0015_0005$$$::Some have been broken down to the point that their flesh has seeped into the cracks of the stone pavement...[lr]::
18394::$$$message_0170_0015_0006$$$::Some are hung against the wall, and are little more than nests for bugs.[lr]::
18395::$$$message_0170_0015_0007$$$::Whatever their arrangement, these...figures have only torsos and heads, and even those are pitifully ragged.::
18396::$$$message_0170_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18397::$$$message_0170_0016_0001$$$::I don't even need to know why.[lr]::
18398::$$$message_0170_0016_0002$$$::The corpses are being eaten away in their coffins.[lr]::
18399::$$$message_0170_0016_0003$$$::I don't know how it works.[lr]::
18400::$$$message_0170_0016_0004$$$::Each corpse is welded into a coffin, and the coffin sucks the nutrients from them.::
18401::$$$message_0170_0017_0000$$$::   The flow of life.[lr]::
18402::$$$message_0170_0017_0001$$$::The coffin is extracting magical energy. Souls.[lr]::
18403::$$$message_0170_0017_0002$$$::Little by little...[lr]::
18404::$$$message_0170_0017_0003$$$::The coffin sucks the life out of its prey in such a precise amount that it neither kills it nor allows it to truly live.::
18405::$$$message_0170_0018_0000$$$::The wind moans through the chamber.[lr]::
18406::$$$message_0170_0018_0001$$$::It's almost like a single scream from the mouths of every corpse here.[lr]::
18407::$$$message_0170_0018_0002$$$::Their throats have long since decayed, so they can't scream for themselves anymore. By now, their throats only barely serve to carry air to their lungs.::
18408::$$$message_0170_0019_0000$$$::But still, the corpses scream.[lr]::
18409::$$$message_0170_0019_0001$$$::All but inaudible, they scream.[lr]::
18410::$$$message_0170_0019_0002$$$::They must be in terrible pain, and so very afraid.[lr]::
18411::$$$message_0170_0019_0003$$$::They continue to shriek, unable to accept that their bodies are being eaten alive as they gradually lose their shape.::
18412::$$$message_0170_0020_0000$$$::"[block len=9]"[lr]::
18413::$$$message_0170_0020_0001$$$::I hear a creaking sound.[lr]::
18414::$$$message_0170_0020_0002$$$::The coffin in front of me gurgles.[lr]::
18415::$$$message_0170_0020_0003$$$::It's oozing.[lr]::
18416::$$$message_0170_0020_0004$$$::The corpse's head is turned toward me. Something falls out of it.::
18417::$$$message_0170_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18418::$$$message_0170_0021_0001$$$::Its swollen lips move slightly.[lr]::
18419::$$$message_0170_0021_0002$$$::In a voice that isn't a voice, it asks,[lr]::
18420::$$$message_0170_0021_0003$$$::"Where. Am. I?"[r]::
18421::$$$message_0170_0021_0004$$$::That's what it wants to know.::
18422::$$$message_0170_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18423::$$$message_0170_0022_0001$$$::I'm about to scream.[lr]::
18424::$$$message_0170_0022_0002$$$::No, I can't even scream anymore.[lr]::
18425::$$$message_0170_0022_0003$$$::[font italic=true]"Where am I?"[font italic=false][lr]::
18426::$$$message_0170_0022_0004$$$::It didn't say it was in pain, didn't ask for help, just wanted to know what this horrible place is.::
18427::$$$message_0170_0023_0000$$$::I'm trying to understand...[lr]::
18428::$$$message_0170_0023_0001$$$::Did that child find themselves in this state when they came to? [lr]::
18429::$$$message_0170_0023_0002$$$::Before this, they must have lived a normal life, slept normally...but one day they woke up and found themselves here.[lr]::
18430::$$$message_0170_0023_0003$$$::The question must have come from the hope that this is just a bad dream. Being trapped in a coffin, unable to move, their limbs rotting...::
18431::$$$message_0170_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18432::$$$message_0170_0024_0001$$$::My heart's breaking.[lr]::
18433::$$$message_0170_0024_0002$$$::This is so unimaginably horrible.[lr]::
18434::$$$message_0170_0024_0003$$$::But...why...?[lr]::
18435::$$$message_0170_0024_0004$$$::Why do they seem so strangely familiar?::
18436::$$$message_0170_0025_0000$$$::I've never seen any of them, but I recognize every one of the corpses.[lr]::
18437::$$$message_0170_0025_0001$$$::This is my first time here...[lr]::
18438::$$$message_0170_0025_0002$$$::I shouldn't know any of them...[lr]::
18439::$$$message_0170_0025_0003$$$::None of them are connected to me, so why...[lr]::
18440::$$$message_0170_0025_0004$$$::Why do they act like they know me?[lr]::
18441::$$$message_0170_0025_0005$$$::(Just like how I know them...)[r]::
18442::$$$message_0170_0025_0006$$$::And why are they staring at me?::
18443::$$$message_0170_0026_0000$$$::"Ah...ah...aaa..."[lr]::
18444::$$$message_0170_0026_0001$$$::And...I have another question.[lr]::
18445::$$$message_0170_0026_0002$$$::Each of them shares something in common, unless that's just a coincidence.[lr]::
18446::$$$message_0170_0026_0003$$$::Why do all these corpses look like children of the same age?::
18447::$$$message_0170_0027_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
18448::$$$message_0170_0027_0001$$$::"Ah. Welcome, Shirou Emiya."[lr]::
18449::$$$message_0170_0027_0002$$$::It comes out of nowhere.[lr]::
18450::$$$message_0170_0027_0003$$$::A hand claps my shoulder from behind. The voice is friendly, like a greeting from a close friend.::
18451::$$$message_0170_0028_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
18452::$$$message_0170_0028_0001$$$::I go completely stiff with shock. I can't even turn around.[lr]::
18453::$$$message_0170_0028_0002$$$::Only, I don't have to turn to see who's behind me.[lr]::
18454::$$$message_0170_0028_0003$$$::Kirei Kotomine.[lr]::
18455::$$$message_0170_0028_0004$$$::This church's priest...the man responsible for this little piece of hell.[lr]::
18456::$$$message_0170_0028_0005$$$::And the devil...the last person I should have run into right now.::
18457::$$$message_0170_0029_0000$$$::"What unfortunate timing. I did expect you to visit soon, so I suppose it's my fault for preparing a meal at this hour.[lr]::
18458::$$$message_0170_0029_0001$$$::Do you recall how I failed to be hospitable last time?[lr]::
18459::$$$message_0170_0029_0002$$$::I attempted to be more considerate this time, but it seems we missed each other."::
18460::$$$message_0170_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18461::$$$message_0170_0030_0001$$$::I can't say anything.[lr]::
18462::$$$message_0170_0030_0002$$$::The priest's hands rest heavily on my shoulders.::
18463::$$$message_0170_0031_0000$$$::"I cannot, however, condone your trespassing. You might see something you shouldn't.[lr]::
18464::$$$message_0170_0031_0001$$$::And then, having learned the truth... Well, that might set our relationship back quite a ways."::
18465::$$$message_0170_0032_0000$$$::The priest sounds more cheerful than I've ever heard.[lr]::
18466::$$$message_0170_0032_0001$$$::As Kotomine stands there behind me, hands on my shoulders, I can tell he's smiling.[lr]::
18467::$$$message_0170_0032_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18468::$$$message_0170_0032_0003$$$::It's...[lr]::
18469::$$$message_0170_0032_0004$$$::...indescribably terrifying.::
18470::$$$message_0170_0033_0000$$$::"What is the matter, Shirou Emiya? You have come to talk, correct? There is no sense being quiet then. Hm, this [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] a surprise. Is this such a bizarre sight to you?"::
18471::$$$message_0170_0034_0000$$$::He sounds so cheerful, even when he's saying such horrible things.[lr]::
18472::$$$message_0170_0034_0001$$$::Does this man not feel [font italic=true]anything[font italic=false] in the face of this horror?[lr]::
18473::$$$message_0170_0034_0002$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
18474::$$$message_0170_0034_0003$$$::Do I even need to comment on how horrible this is!?::
18475::$$$message_0170_0035_0000$$$::"Oh? How cold of you. Proper manners dictate you should at least say it is not, whatever you might think.[lr]::
18476::$$$message_0170_0035_0001$$$::These are practically your brothers and sisters, after all. I do not think they would appreciate such rudeness."::
18477::$$$message_0170_0036_0000$$$::"...Eh?"[lr]::
18478::$$$message_0170_0036_0001$$$::What did...[lr]::
18479::$$$message_0170_0036_0002$$$::What did he just say? And so happily...::
18480::$$$message_0170_0037_0000$$$::"What...did you say?"[lr]::
18481::$$$message_0170_0037_0001$$$::"I said that these corpses are practically your siblings.[lr]::
18482::$$$message_0170_0037_0002$$$::By whatever means, you all survived that hell. You may not be related by blood, but I believe you all share what amounts to a familial bond... Am I wrong?"[lr]::
18483::$$$message_0170_0037_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
18484::$$$message_0170_0038_0000$$$::So that's why I thought I recognized them.[lr]::
18485::$$$message_0170_0038_0001$$$::This is a continuation of what happened ten years ago.[lr]::
18486::$$$message_0170_0038_0002$$$::I'm back in that hospital room.::
18487::$$$message_0170_0039_0000$$$::My head is spinning.[lr]::
18488::$$$message_0170_0039_0001$$$::Children who have lost their homes and parents...[lr]::
18489::$$$message_0170_0039_0002$$$::They were sent to an orphanage until they were adopted.[lr]::
18490::$$$message_0170_0039_0003$$$::But before that happened to me, Kiritsugu Emiya adopted me, so I never knew what happened to those kids afterward.[lr]::
18491::$$$message_0170_0039_0004$$$::I'd actually avoided finding out.[lr]::
18492::$$$message_0170_0039_0005$$$::The orphanage was at the church on top of the hill, and I could have gone there anytime, if I'd wanted to.::
18493::$$$message_0170_0040_0000$$$::But I held back.[lr]::
18494::$$$message_0170_0040_0001$$$::I felt it wasn't fair for me, who did get adopted, to go visit the children who still hadn't been.[lr]::
18495::$$$message_0170_0040_0002$$$::That's why I decided that if I were to meet them, it would have had to be in town.[lr]::
18496::$$$message_0170_0040_0003$$$::We would just bump into each other, chat idly to catch up, and most importantly, have gotten over the fire and hell.[lr]::
18497::$$$message_0170_0040_0004$$$::As small as our town is, I always dreamed of a reunion like that. But it never happened.::
18498::$$$message_0170_0041_0000$$$::"Koto...mine..."[lr]::
18499::$$$message_0170_0041_0001$$$::"That is correct, Shirou Emiya. Had Kiritsugu Emiya not adopted you, you would have shared these things' fate.[lr]::
18500::$$$message_0170_0041_0002$$$::Do you understand? You were the only one who was saved.[lr]::
18501::$$$message_0170_0041_0003$$$::While everyone else died, equal, you were the one who violated this harmony by surviving. What do you think? Do you not find that just a little unfair?"::
18502::$$$message_0170_0042_0000$$$::My heart starts beating again.[lr]::
18503::$$$message_0170_0042_0001$$$::I'd been frozen stiff a moment ago, but suddenly I'm able to move.::
18504::$$$message_0170_0043_0000$$$::"Oh, don't mistake me. This isn't criticism. On the contrary, your situation is a delight. Your talent for survival is impressive. Honestly, I did not expect you to last so long.[lr]::
18505::$$$message_0170_0043_0001$$$::That is why I thought to reunite you with your siblings...here in your final moments."::
18506::$$$message_0170_0044_0000$$$::"You piece of[line2]"::
18507::$$$message_0170_0045_0000$$$::"Lucky boy. I planned to close this place after today, so you barely made it.[lr]::
18508::$$$message_0170_0045_0001$$$::For the past ten years, I have kept them alive as fodder to sustain Servants, but that is all coming to an end. I can no longer collect the same quantity of robust souls, all steeped in agony, as I once did. Of course, there is also no need for feed any longer. All that remains is to kill you and your Servant." ::
18509::$$$message_0170_0046_0000$$$::"YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!!!"::
18510::$$$message_0170_0047_0000$$$::Those words shatter the restraints that had been holding me still.[lr]::
18511::$$$message_0170_0047_0001$$$::I move my paralyzed body.[lr]::
18512::$$$message_0170_0047_0002$$$::Pushing clear of the hands on my shoulders, I leap forward and whirl around to face the priest.::
18513::$$$message_0170_0048_0000$$$::"Kotomine...it was you!!!"[lr]::
18514::$$$message_0170_0048_0001$$$::As I face him, I put distance between us.[lr]::
18515::$$$message_0170_0048_0002$$$::In that moment...[lr]::
18516::$$$message_0170_0048_0003$$$::I feel a powerful impact from behind.::
18517::$$$message_0170_0049_0000$$$::"Ah...ghg...!?"[lr]::
18518::$$$message_0170_0049_0001$$$::That's weird.[lr]::
18519::$$$message_0170_0049_0002$$$::I can't breathe.[lr]::
18520::$$$message_0170_0049_0003$$$::Something sharp protrudes from my chest.[lr]::
18521::$$$message_0170_0049_0004$$$::It looks like the head of a spear.[lr]::
18522::$$$message_0170_0049_0005$$$::That can't be.[lr]::
18523::$$$message_0170_0049_0006$$$::How could a spear be growing out of my chest...?::
18524::$$$message_0170_0050_0000$$$::"Ah yes, I also failed to mention...[lr]::
18525::$$$message_0170_0050_0001$$$::Allow me to formally introduce you to my Servant."[lr]::
18526::$$$message_0170_0050_0002$$$::"Nnn...gh...ngggh..."[lr]::
18527::$$$message_0170_0050_0003$$$::I turn around.[lr]::
18528::$$$message_0170_0050_0004$$$::There...[lr]::
18529::$$$message_0170_0050_0005$$$::I see a blue-colored spearman, his weapon thrust through my chest.::
18530::$$$message_0170_0051_0000$$$::He jerks it free.[lr]::
18531::$$$message_0170_0051_0001$$$::At the same time...[lr]::
18532::$$$message_0170_0051_0002$$$::...a searing, intense pain rocks my entire body.::
18533::$$$message_0170_0052_0000$$$::"Ah...gaaagh...!"[lr]::
18534::$$$message_0170_0052_0001$$$::Red splatters the floor.[lr]::
18535::$$$message_0170_0052_0002$$$::I collapse onto the slimy, mossy ground.[lr]::
18536::$$$message_0170_0052_0003$$$::I try to push myself to my feet, but my body's too heavy.[lr]::
18537::$$$message_0170_0052_0004$$$::I can't move.[lr]::
18538::$$$message_0170_0052_0005$$$::While I may not be paralyzed anymore, my body isn't capable of moving for entirely different reasons now.::
18539::$$$message_0170_0053_0000$$$::"Ghggg! Ha...h!"[lr]::
18540::$$$message_0170_0053_0001$$$::The pain in my chest is unbelievable, blotting out the blood loss and dimming vision.[lr]::
18541::$$$message_0170_0053_0002$$$::I can't pass out.[lr]::
18542::$$$message_0170_0053_0003$$$::I've sustained fatal wounds numerous times.[lr]::
18543::$$$message_0170_0053_0004$$$::They were all bad; they all numbed my senses.[lr]::
18544::$$$message_0170_0053_0005$$$::But this is different.[lr]::
18545::$$$message_0170_0053_0006$$$::It's a fatal wound for sure, but the pain is just too intense.::
18546::$$$message_0170_0054_0000$$$::"Ha...aaah...ha...krrrh!"[lr]::
18547::$$$message_0170_0054_0001$$$::My vision distorts.[lr]::
18548::$$$message_0170_0054_0002$$$::The instant I pass out from pain, more pain jolts me back awake.[lr]::
18549::$$$message_0170_0054_0003$$$::I can't feel my limbs.[lr]::
18550::$$$message_0170_0054_0004$$$::I can't even tell where I am anymore.[lr]::
18551::$$$message_0170_0054_0005$$$::The only things I feel are vomit-inducing pain, and the temptation to just disappear to escape this agony.::
18552::$$$message_0170_0055_0000$$$::"I told you not to kill him, Lancer. Otherwise there would be no point in keeping him alive until now."[lr]::
18553::$$$message_0170_0055_0001$$$::I can only hear voices.[lr]::
18554::$$$message_0170_0055_0002$$$::My eyes are open but I can't see anything.::
18555::$$$message_0170_0056_0000$$$::"I hear ya, even if I don't love the order."[lr]::
18556::$$$message_0170_0056_0001$$$::Lancer's voice is devoid of emotion.[lr]::
18557::$$$message_0170_0056_0002$$$::But I can barely hear him.::
18558::$$$message_0170_0057_0000$$$::"Fine. Then we will begin our preparations. A Servant can sense when their Master's in danger. We have about thirty minutes until Saber arrives here."[lr]::
18559::$$$message_0170_0057_0001$$$::"Kotomine, this kid's not gonna last that long. If you want him alive, you should stop the bleeding."[lr]::
18560::$$$message_0170_0057_0002$$$::"That will not be necessary. If he dies, so be it."::
18561::$$$message_0170_0058_0000$$$::My mind is fading...[lr]::
18562::$$$message_0170_0058_0001$$$::The pain finally becomes too much, and my mind lets me faint.::
18563::$$$message_0170_0059_0000$$$::"Ghhh...ah!"[lr]::
18564::$$$message_0170_0059_0001$$$::I stop the pain by digging into my wound.[lr]::
18565::$$$message_0170_0059_0002$$$::   The pain resumes.[lr]::
18566::$$$message_0170_0059_0003$$$::I'm on the verge of sinking into oblivion, only to be dragged into a world of searing pain.::
18567::$$$message_0170_0060_0000$$$::I want to die.[lr]::
18568::$$$message_0170_0060_0001$$$::If this pain isn't going to stop, I want to die right now.[lr]::
18569::$$$message_0170_0060_0002$$$::I know that.[lr]::
18570::$$$message_0170_0060_0003$$$::I know, but if I faint here, I know I'm never going to wake up.::
18571::$$$message_0170_0061_0000$$$::I can't even remember what I'm doing.[lr]::
18572::$$$message_0170_0061_0001$$$::I feel like I'm just drifting through white-hot pain that will burn me to nothing.[lr]::
18573::$$$message_0170_0061_0002$$$::"Ha...Sa...ber...!"[lr]::
18574::$$$message_0170_0061_0003$$$::I grit my teeth, trying to endure the pain, and trying to cling to my own fading awareness.::
18575::$$$message_0170_0062_0000$$$::   I can't end it all here.[lr]::
18576::$$$message_0170_0062_0001$$$::I can't let myself drop out of the war so easily.[lr]::
18577::$$$message_0170_0062_0002$$$::There's still a promise I haven't fulfilled yet.[lr]::
18578::$$$message_0170_0062_0003$$$::If I believe she is the most important person in my world...[lr]::
18579::$$$message_0170_0062_0004$$$::I can't just disappear here.::
