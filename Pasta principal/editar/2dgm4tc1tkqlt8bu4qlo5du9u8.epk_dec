66549::$$$message_0615_0000_0000$$$::Complete silence.[lr]::
66550::$$$message_0615_0000_0001$$$::They were not the only ones here to appreciate the loss of life and ruin of prosperity.[lr]::
66551::$$$message_0615_0000_0002$$$::No, that expression was not quite accurate.[lr]::
66552::$$$message_0615_0000_0003$$$::The boy and girl still showed an admirable will to fight,[lr]::
66553::$$$message_0615_0000_0004$$$::and they clearly did not appreciate what they found.[lr]::
66554::$$$message_0615_0000_0005$$$::Only one who was no longer human would delight in this tragedy.::
66555::$$$message_0615_0001_0000$$$::"My, my. They just don't know when to quit.[lr]::
66556::$$$message_0615_0001_0001$$$::I thought it was fine to let them be, but perhaps it's time to nip this in the bud."::
66557::$$$message_0615_0002_0000$$$::The old man cackles.[lr]::
66558::$$$message_0615_0002_0001$$$::He blends into the shadows as he roams the uninhabited town, white skull in tow.[lr]::
66559::$$$message_0615_0002_0002$$$::He is looking at the boy and girl.[lr]::
66560::$$$message_0615_0002_0003$$$::The old man pleasantly watches his enemies.[lr]::
66561::$$$message_0615_0002_0004$$$::He has no hostile intent.[lr]::
66562::$$$message_0615_0002_0005$$$::How could he hate something that is hardly even a foe to him anymore?[lr]::
66563::$$$message_0615_0002_0006$$$::To the old man, they are no different from pebbles by the wayside.::
66564::$$$message_0615_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66565::$$$message_0615_0003_0001$$$::But the white skull thinks differently.[lr]::
66566::$$$message_0615_0003_0002$$$::To him, a threat is a threat, no matter how small.[lr]::
66567::$$$message_0615_0003_0003$$$::Any obstacles should be removed on the spot, even if they are beyond his own powers to defeat.[lr]::
66568::$$$message_0615_0003_0004$$$::The man who was summoned as Assassin acts strictly according to that unwritten law.::
66569::$$$message_0615_0004_0000$$$::"Should we not kill them where they stand?"[lr]::
66570::$$$message_0615_0004_0001$$$::He inquires of his lord.[lr]::
66571::$$$message_0615_0004_0002$$$::The boy and girl are highly vulnerable as they walk through the ghost town.[lr]::
66572::$$$message_0615_0004_0003$$$::How can they be so defenseless in this land of death?[lr]::
66573::$$$message_0615_0004_0004$$$::The skull can only see them as sick individuals with a wish for death.[lr]::
66574::$$$message_0615_0004_0005$$$::Thus, one might even consider it a mercy to end them here.::
66575::$$$message_0615_0005_0000$$$::And yet...[lr]::
66576::$$$message_0615_0005_0001$$$::"No, that would be a bit of a waste. I've let them live this long, so it would be so dull to end them now."[lr]::
66577::$$$message_0615_0005_0002$$$::The old man has no mercy.[lr]::
66578::$$$message_0615_0005_0003$$$::He is rotten to the core, having lived over five hundred years and lost his humanity in all but shape.::
66579::$$$message_0615_0006_0000$$$::"Hmm. What do you think of this plot, Assassin?[lr]::
66580::$$$message_0615_0006_0001$$$::There is a living sacrifice here. A pitiable hunk of meat shunned, hated, and cursed by the world of men. This meat nobly tries to save the world. As long as even one person is on its side, it endeavors to save the world its allies live in."::
66581::$$$message_0615_0007_0000$$$::"Goodness, passion is so precious and powerful. The world will never exhaust its hate for the meat, no matter what it does. It desperately tries to hold its mud in, believing that hating them back would mean rejecting its ally. [lr]::
66582::$$$message_0615_0007_0001$$$::Therefore, nothing the meat does will matter."::
66583::$$$message_0615_0008_0000$$$::"But...what would happen if it was rejected by its only ally?[lr]::
66584::$$$message_0615_0008_0001$$$::It has always been scorned by the entire world. If its one and only hope were to betray it, it would have no morality to keep it in check."::
66585::$$$message_0615_0009_0000$$$::"Then, Lord Mage, do you intend to have that boy give the final push?"[lr]::
66586::$$$message_0615_0009_0001$$$::"Indeed I do. He is the right character to close out this play. He has grown more than expected, but managed to survive this long. It is only right that I allow him the pleasure of killing it."::
66587::$$$message_0615_0010_0000$$$::He chuckles in delight.[lr]::
66588::$$$message_0615_0010_0001$$$::Sadism and satisfaction color his mirth.[lr]::
66589::$$$message_0615_0010_0002$$$::Enamored with his own ingenious suggestion, his chattering laugh makes him seem like a skull bobbing in the wind.::
