61867::$$$message_0565_0000_0000$$$::   Let's patrol Shinto.[lr]::
61868::$$$message_0565_0000_0001$$$::We can't let our guard down, even if Caster has been defeated.[lr]::
61869::$$$message_0565_0000_0002$$$::I need to find the still-unknown Master of Lancer and determine their intent.::
61870::$$$message_0565_0001_0000$$$::"We're going to Shinto. Come with me, Saber."[lr]::
61871::$$$message_0565_0001_0001$$$::"Understood. Is the plan the same as yesterday?"[lr]::
61872::$$$message_0565_0001_0002$$$::"Yeah. I'll act helpless until we lure out an enemy."::
61873::$$$message_0565_0002_0000$$$::I turn off the living room lights.[lr]::
61874::$$$message_0565_0002_0001$$$::So as not to wake Sakura, I slip out of the house as quietly as I can.::
61875::$$$message_0565_0003_0000$$$::We spend about an hour patrolling the town, but fail to turn up anything of note.::
61876::$$$message_0565_0004_0000$$$::According to Saber, the magical energy threads that Caster had throughout Shinto have largely thinned out, but I can't sense such subtle changes.[lr]::
61877::$$$message_0565_0004_0001$$$::Since there's no obvious traces of energy in Shinto, it looks like there isn't another Master there...::
61878::$$$message_0565_0005_0000$$$::"What is the matter, Shirou? You seem unhappy about something."[lr]::
61879::$$$message_0565_0005_0001$$$::"Huh...? Oh, not really. I just thought the train station feels pretty empty. It's almost like..."::
61880::$$$message_0565_0006_0000$$$::...a ghost town, I almost say.[lr]::
61881::$$$message_0565_0006_0001$$$::...It's probably just a fluke.[lr]::
61882::$$$message_0565_0006_0002$$$::Nothing out of the ordinary happened tonight. There are just fewer people out than usual.::
61883::$$$message_0565_0007_0000$$$::"Let's go home, Saber. I don't think we'll learn anything else walking around aimlessly."[lr]::
61884::$$$message_0565_0007_0001$$$::"...Yes. You still aren't feeling well, so let us retire early tonight."::
61885::$$$message_0565_0008_0000$$$::We leave Shinto behind.[lr]::
61886::$$$message_0565_0008_0001$$$::The hollow echo of our footsteps is the only sound in the terminal.::
