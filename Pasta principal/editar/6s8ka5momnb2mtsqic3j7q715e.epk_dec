33395::$$$message_0266_0000_0000$$$::...It's windy.[lr]::
33396::$$$message_0266_0000_0001$$$::I suppose part of it is being atop a hill.[lr]::
33397::$$$message_0266_0000_0002$$$::The breeze is stronger than below, and the chill that pierces my cheeks has a stronger bite.::
33398::$$$message_0266_0001_0000$$$::"Shirou, have you finished talking?"[lr]::
33399::$$$message_0266_0001_0001$$$::"...Yeah. I've been made aware of more than I could ever want.[lr]::
33400::$$$message_0266_0001_0002$$$::About the Holy Grail War and Masters, too."[lr]::
33401::$$$message_0266_0001_0003$$$::"In that case..."::
33402::$$$message_0266_0002_0000$$$::She leans forward and pierces me with a stare.[lr]::
33403::$$$message_0266_0002_0001$$$::...That's only natural.[lr]::
33404::$$$message_0266_0002_0002$$$::The decision that I make is her business too.::
33405::$$$message_0266_0003_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I don't know if I'm fit for it, but I decided to fight and be a Master.[lr]::
33406::$$$message_0266_0003_0001$$$::I'm sorry that I'm an amateur, but do you still agree to take me on as a Master, Saber?"::
33407::$$$message_0266_0004_0000$$$::"There is no need for such an agreement. You are my Master. I have already vowed that I would become your sword."::
33408::$$$message_0266_0005_0000$$$::That moment flitters through my mind.[lr]::
33409::$$$message_0266_0005_0001$$$::"...That's right. Yeah, it makes me relieved hearing you say that."[lr]::
33410::$$$message_0266_0005_0002$$$::I take a deep breath and face Saber again.::
33411::$$$message_0266_0006_0000$$$::"Shake on it, then. Let's do our best, Saber."[lr]::
33412::$$$message_0266_0006_0001$$$::I extend my right hand.[lr]::
33413::$$$message_0266_0006_0002$$$::I don't know anything about the relationship between Master and Servant, and what we need to do moving forward.[lr]::
33414::$$$message_0266_0006_0003$$$::But at the very least, I want to start out on the right foot.::
33415::$$$message_0266_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33416::$$$message_0266_0007_0001$$$::"Saber? Oh, are you against shaking hands?"[lr]::
33417::$$$message_0266_0007_0002$$$::"...No, that is not true. I was just startled by the suddenness."::
33418::$$$message_0266_0008_0000$$$::Saber says as she takes my hand in hers.[lr]::
33419::$$$message_0266_0008_0001$$$::"I vow once again. As long as you have your Command Spells, I will be your sword."::
33420::$$$message_0266_0009_0000$$$::"Okay. I still don't understand everything, but it's good to have you."[lr]::
33421::$$$message_0266_0009_0001$$$::Since Saber is so serious, I nod along.::
33422::$$$message_0266_0010_0000$$$::"...Hm."[lr]::
33423::$$$message_0266_0010_0001$$$::...Come to think of it, this is an odd sight.[lr]::
33424::$$$message_0266_0010_0002$$$::Under the stars in the winter night...[lr]::
33425::$$$message_0266_0010_0003$$$::...I'm shaking hands with a girl I just met and exchanging words like some magical contract.::
33426::$$$message_0266_0011_0000$$$::"Ooh. It looks like I can leave you two at it, huh?"[lr]::
33427::$$$message_0266_0011_0001$$$::"...!"[lr]::
33428::$$$message_0266_0011_0002$$$::I hastily let go of her hand.[lr]::
33429::$$$message_0266_0011_0003$$$::When I turn around, there's Tohsaka and...that knight in the red coat standing there.::
33430::$$$message_0266_0012_0000$$$::"Look at you two getting along. You weren't even talking until a moment ago. What a change. What, do you fully trust Saber now?"::
33431::$$$message_0266_0013_0000$$$::"Uh, no, that's not it... Wait, I guess you're right.[lr]::
33432::$$$message_0266_0013_0001$$$::I don't know anything about Saber yet, but we're going to work together from now on."::
33433::$$$message_0266_0014_0000$$$::"I see. Then you should be on your guard. Now that you guys are in this war, we won't go easy on you either."[lr]::
33434::$$$message_0266_0014_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
33435::$$$message_0266_0014_0002$$$::I tilt my head.[lr]::
33436::$$$message_0266_0014_0003$$$::It takes me a second for it to sink in.::
33437::$$$message_0266_0015_0000$$$::"...Hey now. You understand we're enemies now, right?[lr]::
33438::$$$message_0266_0015_0001$$$::I brought you here because you weren't my enemy yet.[lr]::
33439::$$$message_0266_0015_0002$$$::But now you're a Master, right? Then I think there's only one thing to do now."::
33440::$$$message_0266_0016_0000$$$::"Uh... Hmm?"[lr]::
33441::$$$message_0266_0016_0001$$$::Well, that's true, but...[lr]::
33442::$$$message_0266_0016_0002$$$::"Why? I don't intend to fight you, Tohsaka."::
33443::$$$message_0266_0017_0000$$$::"...Man, just as I thought. Geez, it was meaningless to bring you here."[lr]::
33444::$$$message_0266_0017_0001$$$::Tohsaka drops her shoulders.[lr]::
33445::$$$message_0266_0017_0002$$$::"Rin."::
33446::$$$message_0266_0018_0000$$$::"What? We promised that you wouldn't talk until I give the go-ahead, Archer."[lr]::
33447::$$$message_0266_0018_0001$$$::"I know, but we'll get nowhere at this rate.[lr]::
33448::$$$message_0266_0018_0002$$$::There's no need to find out if our opponent is ready or not. If there's an enemy we can defeat easily, we should attack them without holding back."[lr]::
33449::$$$message_0266_0018_0003$$$::"Hey, I know that without you having to tell me."::
33450::$$$message_0266_0019_0000$$$::"If you know, then you should act on it. Or what? Are you going to show him mercy again?[lr]::
33451::$$$message_0266_0019_0001$$$::...Hm. It couldn't possibly be that there's some special reason...?"::
33452::$$$message_0266_0020_0000$$$::"O-of course not!"[lr]::
33453::$$$message_0266_0020_0001$$$::...It's just, you know, I owe him one. Until I clear that up, I just can't fight him fairly."[lr]::
33454::$$$message_0266_0020_0002$$$::"...Hrm, you sure are difficult. Then I'll make myself scarce. Call me again after you've straightened that out."::
33455::$$$message_0266_0021_0000$$$::The red knight, Archer, disappears.[lr]::
33456::$$$message_0266_0021_0001$$$::Or rather, I just can't see him anymore.[lr]::
33457::$$$message_0266_0021_0002$$$::According to Tohsaka, Servants are spirits.::
33458::$$$message_0266_0022_0000$$$::Saber says that she can't turn into spirit form, but I'm sure she could easily if she was Tohsaka's Servant, since Tohsaka is a functional Master.[lr]::
33459::$$$message_0266_0022_0001$$$::...Well, aside from that...::
33460::$$$message_0266_0023_0000$$$::"Hey, Tohsaka. That thing you owe me... Are you talking about what happened earlier?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          [lr]::
33461::$$$message_0266_0023_0001$$$::"Yeah. No matter what the reason may be, you used a Command Spell to stop Saber. So, it won't be fair unless I hold back a bit to balance things out."::
33462::$$$message_0266_0024_0000$$$::"...Balance, huh? You care about weird things, Tohsaka."[lr]::
33463::$$$message_0266_0024_0001$$$::"I know. I know this is just piling on some extra weight. But I can't help it, I hate being in debt to people." [lr]::
33464::$$$message_0266_0024_0002$$$::She snorts and turns away.::
33465::$$$message_0266_0025_0000$$$::"But, this is for a limited time. Starting tomorrow, I won't hold back, so you should go ahead and make your plans with Saber." [lr]::
33466::$$$message_0266_0025_0001$$$::"...Hm. So, this is only for today?"::
33467::$$$message_0266_0026_0000$$$::"That's right. Well, I [font italic=true]am[font italic=false] the one who brought you here.[lr]::
33468::$$$message_0266_0026_0001$$$::Um, so I'll at least look out for you until you get back into town."[lr]::
33469::$$$message_0266_0026_0002$$$::With that, Tohsaka starts walking without looking back at us.::
33470::$$$message_0266_0027_0000$$$::"Let us go, Shirou. As she says, it is not good to stay here."[lr]::
33471::$$$message_0266_0027_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
33472::$$$message_0266_0027_0002$$$::I nod to Saber and follow Tohsaka.::
33473::$$$message_0266_0028_0000$$$::The three of us descend the hill.[lr]::
33474::$$$message_0266_0028_0001$$$::It might be because Tohsaka took the lead, but we make our way back without any conversation.::
33475::$$$message_0266_0029_0000$$$::There is a simple forked road ahead of us.[lr]::
33476::$$$message_0266_0029_0001$$$::One path leads to the main street going towards the front of Shinto station, and the other leads to the big bridge connecting to Miyama.[lr]::
33477::$$$message_0266_0029_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33478::$$$message_0266_0029_0003$$$::Tohsaka stops in front of the intersection.::
33479::$$$message_0266_0030_0000$$$::"Tohsaka? Aren't you coming? We should head to the bridge if we're going home, right?"[lr]::
33480::$$$message_0266_0030_0001$$$::"No. Sorry, but you'll have to head home on your own.[lr]::
33481::$$$message_0266_0030_0002$$$::I forgot since I've been so occupied with you, but I had other plans. Now that I'm in Shinto, I'm gonna go look for something while I'm here."::
33482::$$$message_0266_0031_0000$$$::"Go look for something...as in other Masters?"::
33483::$$$message_0266_0032_0000$$$::"Yeah. I don't know about you, but I've been waiting for this for a long time. For the seven Masters to appear and the night the Holy Grail War begins.[lr]::
33484::$$$message_0266_0032_0001$$$::Wouldn't you say that going straight home is a waste? Since I couldn't beat Saber, I won't feel satisfied unless I can take down another Servant."::
33485::$$$message_0266_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33486::$$$message_0266_0033_0001$$$::...There is no hesitation in Tohsaka's eyes.[lr]::
33487::$$$message_0266_0033_0002$$$::That made me realize...[lr]::
33488::$$$message_0266_0033_0003$$$::Tohsaka is a mage.[lr]::
33489::$$$message_0266_0033_0004$$$::Her knowledge and attitude as a mage are set.::
33490::$$$message_0266_0034_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33491::$$$message_0266_0034_0001$$$::I wonder why...::
33492::$$$message_0266_0035_0000$$$::"So, we part ways here. I've paid back my debt, and it'll just be a pain if we're in each other's faces. After today we'll become enemies."[lr]::
33493::$$$message_0266_0035_0001$$$::Why does she have this part of her that's the opposite of a mage?::
33494::$$$message_0266_0036_0000$$$::Tohsaka didn't explain the rules out of a sense of duty.[lr]::
33495::$$$message_0266_0036_0001$$$::She just wanted to be fair, and after figuring out my circumstances, supported me.::
33496::$$$message_0266_0037_0000$$$::So now that the situation is clear, it goes back to how it was before.[lr]::
33497::$$$message_0266_0037_0001$$$::As a Master, I will be a target for battle from now on.[lr]::
33498::$$$message_0266_0037_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
33499::$$$message_0266_0037_0003$$$::Despite all that, Tohsaka made sure to clear the air first.::
33500::$$$message_0266_0038_0000$$$::For her, everything that happened tonight was unnecessary.[lr]::
33501::$$$message_0266_0038_0001$$$::"It'll just be a pain if we're in each other's faces."[r]::
33502::$$$message_0266_0038_0002$$$::If that's how she really feels, she shouldn't have gotten involved to begin with.[lr]::
33503::$$$message_0266_0038_0003$$$::But she isn't dumb, so she must've known this is how it would go.[lr]::
33504::$$$message_0266_0038_0004$$$::And yet still she helped out, all without thinking about cost or benefit.::
33505::$$$message_0266_0039_0000$$$::...The Tohsaka in front of me is so different from the one I see at school. [lr]::
33506::$$$message_0266_0039_0001$$$::Even putting it nicely, she's harsh and cranky. A real sourpuss. And so different from what she normally projects that it makes me want to scream, [font italic=true]What's up with the way you act at school!?[font italic=false][lr]::
33507::$$$message_0266_0039_0002$$$::Man, she almost seems like a fraud.::
33508::$$$message_0266_0040_0000$$$::...Yet, still...[lr]::
33509::$$$message_0266_0040_0001$$$::Tohsaka Rin is also exactly how everyone thought she was.::
33510::$$$message_0266_0041_0000$$$::"Yeah. Tohsaka, you're a good person."[lr]::
33511::$$$message_0266_0041_0001$$$::"Huh? What's with you? I won't go easy on you even if you try flattery."::
33512::$$$message_0266_0042_0000$$$::I know that.[lr]::
33513::$$$message_0266_0042_0001$$$::Because she won't go easy on me, it'll be a pain to also be on the lookout for me. That's what she's saying.::
33514::$$$message_0266_0043_0000$$$::"I know. But if possible, I don't want to be enemies. I like people like you."[lr]::
33515::$$$message_0266_0043_0001$$$::"Wha[line2]"::
33516::$$$message_0266_0044_0000$$$::For some reason, Tohsaka falls silent.[lr]::
33517::$$$message_0266_0044_0001$$$::These deserted suburbs...[lr]::
33518::$$$message_0266_0044_0002$$$::The church that looms in the distance and the stillness of the foreigner cemetery that spreads over the hill feel strangely warm now.::
33519::$$$message_0266_0045_0000$$$::"A-anyway, if your Servant gets killed, just run to that church. If you do that, at least your life will be spared."::
33520::$$$message_0266_0046_0000$$$::"Got it. I don't exactly like the idea, but I'll keep it in mind. Highly doubt it'll happen, though. No matter how I look at it, I'll die before Saber does."[lr]::
33521::$$$message_0266_0046_0001$$$::"...Ugh."[lr]::
33522::$$$message_0266_0046_0002$$$::Tohsaka reacts strangely again.[lr]::
33523::$$$message_0266_0046_0003$$$::She lets out a deep sigh as if she's fed up with me and glances at Saber.::
33524::$$$message_0266_0047_0000$$$::"All right, I won't give you any more warnings since then I'll really be going out of my way.[lr]::
33525::$$$message_0266_0047_0001$$$::Just be careful. Even with Saber as strong as she is, it won't matter if you, the Master, gets killed."[lr]::
33526::$$$message_0266_0047_0002$$$::Tohsaka turns around and starts walking towards Shinto.::
33527::$$$message_0266_0048_0000$$$::However...[lr]::
33528::$$$message_0266_0048_0001$$$::She stops dead in her tracks, as if she saw a ghost.::
33529::$$$message_0266_0049_0000$$$::                                       "Hey, are you done talking?"::
33530::$$$message_0266_0050_0000$$$::A youthful voice echoes through the night.[lr]::
33531::$$$message_0266_0050_0001$$$::The singsong voice is unmistakably that of a young girl.[lr]::
33532::$$$message_0266_0050_0002$$$::My line of sight focuses on the top of the hill.[lr]::
33533::$$$message_0266_0050_0003$$$::There...::
33534::$$$message_0266_0051_0000$$$::I don't know when the skies cleared, but the moon shines brightly in the night.[lr]::
33535::$$$message_0266_0051_0001$$$::The shadow is long and monstrous, like a demon in a picture book.[lr]::
33536::$$$message_0266_0051_0002$$$::Amidst the silhouette of the townscape, through the late night gloom, something terrible stands.::
33537::$$$message_0266_0052_0000$$$::"...Berserker."[lr]::
33538::$$$message_0266_0052_0001$$$::Tohsaka mumbles a word that I'm not familiar with.[lr]::
33539::$$$message_0266_0052_0002$$$::Even if I don't know what that means, I can tell that the giant is something different altogether.::
33540::$$$message_0266_0053_0000$$$::That thing isn't human.[lr]::
33541::$$$message_0266_0053_0001$$$::Then... It's one of the beings called Servants, just like Saber and the others.::
33542::$$$message_0266_0053_0002$$$::"Good evening, big brother. This is the second time we've met like this."[lr]::
33543::$$$message_0266_0053_0003$$$::The girl says, smiling.[lr]::
33544::$$$message_0266_0053_0004$$$::The innocence sends a chill down my spine.[lr]::
33545::$$$message_0266_0053_0005$$$::The dissonance between her and that monstrous shape behind her makes me feel like I'm living a nightmare.::
33546::$$$message_0266_0053_0006$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33547::$$$message_0266_0053_0007$$$::What I said earlier about a chill down my spine is underselling it.[lr]::
33548::$$$message_0266_0053_0008$$$::The chill reaches every part of me, deep into my consciousness.[lr]::
33549::$$$message_0266_0053_0009$$$::That thing is a monster.[lr]::
33550::$$$message_0266_0053_0010$$$::I'm not even looking directly at it but its very presence is making it hard to move...::
33551::$$$message_0266_0054_0000$$$::"...I'm surprised. If we're talking just raw power, that thing surpasses Saber."[lr]::
33552::$$$message_0266_0054_0001$$$::She clicks her tongue and glares at the monster above us.[lr]::
33553::$$$message_0266_0054_0002$$$::From her back alone, I can tell she is just as terrified as I am, but also determined not to lose to that thing.::
33554::$$$message_0266_0055_0000$$$::"Archer, that thing isn't something that can be fought head-on. Fight it with your class specialty."[lr]::
33555::$$$message_0266_0055_0001$$$::Her voice is barely more than a whisper.[lr]::
33556::$$$message_0266_0055_0002$$$::The unmaterialized knight gives his response.::
33557::$$$message_0266_0056_0000$$$::"Understood. But what about your defense? You cannot avoid a charge."[lr]::
33558::$$$message_0266_0056_0001$$$::"There's three of us. If it's just playing defense, we can manage."[lr]::
33559::$$$message_0266_0056_0002$$$::He must have nodded to that.[lr]::
33560::$$$message_0266_0056_0003$$$::The presence hanging around Tohsaka vanishes instantly.::
