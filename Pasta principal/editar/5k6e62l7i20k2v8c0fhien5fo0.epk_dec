49215::$$$message_0425_0000_0000$$$::In that instant...[lr]::
49216::$$$message_0425_0000_0001$$$::I deploy the strongest weapon out of all the items I've ever replicated.[lr]::
49217::$$$message_0425_0000_0002$$$::But it won't even work as a shield against what is presented before me.[lr]::
49218::$$$message_0425_0000_0003$$$::The sword of rupture.[lr]::
49219::$$$message_0425_0000_0004$$$::The mysterious sword cuts through the wind, annihilates six Noble Phantasms, and severs my body.::
49220::$$$message_0425_0001_0000$$$::It's disappearing.[lr]::
49221::$$$message_0425_0001_0001$$$::My circuit gets disconnected, and the magical energy from Tohsaka has nowhere to go but back.[lr]::
49222::$$$message_0425_0001_0002$$$::"Da...mn..."::
49223::$$$message_0425_0002_0000$$$::I curse at my inadequacy.[lr]::
49224::$$$message_0425_0002_0001$$$::I knew I was inexperienced. But I seriously curse at myself for never really thinking of the implications or how that would affect me.[lr]::
49225::$$$message_0425_0002_0002$$$::Why do I have so few Magic Circuits?[lr]::
49226::$$$message_0425_0002_0003$$$::If only I had a little more...[lr]::
49227::$$$message_0425_0002_0004$$$::If only I had a little more, and reached beyond that darkness a bit...I could have fought like him...::
49228::$$$message_0425_0003_0000$$$::    I fall to the ground.[lr]::
49229::$$$message_0425_0003_0001$$$::I can't soften the impact and I fly dozens of meters away, falling violently on my back.::
49230::$$$message_0425_0004_0000$$$::There's no pain from the impact.[lr]::
49231::$$$message_0425_0004_0001$$$::I've lost all sensation.[lr]::
49232::$$$message_0425_0004_0002$$$::Even my mind goes white and blank.[lr]::
49233::$$$message_0425_0004_0003$$$::Right before I head toward death...[lr]::
49234::$$$message_0425_0004_0004$$$::My last thought is how amazed I am that my limbs are still attached.::
49235::$$$message_0425_0005_0000$$$::"This ends here. A fake will always be a fake. You cannot save anyone."::
49236::$$$message_0425_0006_0000$$$::My heartbeat gets weaker.[lr]::
49237::$$$message_0425_0006_0001$$$::My lungs are not moving, and my trachea is frozen.::
49238::$$$message_0425_0007_0000$$$::"Sparing Archer would have afforded me more amusement.[lr]::
49239::$$$message_0425_0007_0001$$$::He was also a fraud, but at least his principles were not uncultured."::
49240::$$$message_0425_0008_0000$$$::The fact that I can't see isn't because my eyes are damaged.[lr]::
49241::$$$message_0425_0008_0001$$$::Right now, everything inside me is messed up, and my body has ceased to function properly.[lr]::
49242::$$$message_0425_0008_0002$$$::Maybe I would consider that to be fortunate.[lr]::
49243::$$$message_0425_0008_0003$$$::I've forgotten all sensation of pain, so I should be able to die easily at this rate...::
49244::$$$message_0425_0009_0000$$$::"Ah. I remember now. He said your ideal is a borrowed one. How can someone who has not created a single thing from his own accord think he can accomplish anything?"::
49245::$$$message_0425_0010_0000$$$::   I can't...let that happen.[lr]::
49246::$$$message_0425_0010_0001$$$::Even if the pain causes me to be brain-dead if I come to my senses, I tell myself I need to regain consciousness and stand up.[lr]::
49247::$$$message_0425_0010_0002$$$::My deeply rooted psyche is pointing to a certain place and telling me something.::
49248::$$$message_0425_0011_0000$$$::"A hero of justice? A world where no one gets hurt?[lr]::
49249::$$$message_0425_0011_0001$$$::You say such ridiculous things. There is no such world where happiness can be preserved without harming others.[lr]::
49250::$$$message_0425_0011_0002$$$::Humans are basically beasts that cannot enjoy their life without sacrifice. The pretense of equality is nothing more than drivel by the weak who cannot face darkness.[lr]::
49251::$$$message_0425_0011_0003$$$::Mongrel. Your ideal is just an excuse to cover up ugliness."::
49252::$$$message_0425_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
49253::$$$message_0425_0012_0001$$$::I raise my arm, even though it shouldn't be able to move.[lr]::
49254::$$$message_0425_0012_0002$$$::My body is on the ground and my consciousness is on the brink of death.[lr]::
49255::$$$message_0425_0012_0003$$$::I raise my arm to grab on to something...like I did on that fateful day.::
49256::$$$message_0425_0013_0000$$$::I don't know what's funny, but someone's laughing.[lr]::
49257::$$$message_0425_0013_0001$$$::The high pitched laughter that assaults my ears sounded like everyone in the entire world was laughing.::
49258::$$$message_0425_0014_0000$$$::A fake wish.[lr]::
49259::$$$message_0425_0014_0001$$$::A borrowed ideal.[lr]::
49260::$$$message_0425_0014_0002$$$::That dream won't come true, someone sneers.::
49261::$$$message_0425_0015_0000$$$::Yeah...they're right.[lr]::
49262::$$$message_0425_0015_0001$$$::These thoughts of mine are borrowed.[lr]::
49263::$$$message_0425_0015_0002$$$::I just admired the wish to help someone because it was beautiful.[lr]::
49264::$$$message_0425_0015_0003$$$::There's nothing that came from me.[lr]::
49265::$$$message_0425_0015_0004$$$::I was always driven by this curse-like obsession that my body needed to be for someone else.::
49266::$$$message_0425_0016_0000$$$::That's why it's fake.[lr]::
49267::$$$message_0425_0016_0001$$$::Such hypocrisy will save nothing in the end.[lr]::
49268::$$$message_0425_0016_0002$$$::First of all, I don't even know what needs to be saved.::
49269::$$$message_0425_0017_0000$$$::But...[lr]::
49270::$$$message_0425_0017_0001$$$::But I also still feel that's beautiful.::
49271::$$$message_0425_0018_0000$$$::That concept did not come from me.[lr]::
49272::$$$message_0425_0018_0001$$$::I just saw someone save someone else, and mimicked it.[lr]::
49273::$$$message_0425_0018_0002$$$::On that day, I was empty inside.[lr]::
49274::$$$message_0425_0018_0003$$$::Everyone died indiscriminately, and I couldn't save anyone.[lr]::
49275::$$$message_0425_0018_0004$$$::I couldn't suppress my terror at that sight that was unraveling before me, and I had no choice but to resign myself to the fact that humans were weak.::
49276::$$$message_0425_0019_0000$$$::    That's why...::
49277::$$$message_0425_0020_0000$$$::That's why I admired that ideal.[lr]::
49278::$$$message_0425_0020_0001$$$::I cried at the preciousness of it because I didn't have it myself.[lr]::
49279::$$$message_0425_0020_0002$$$::Is that wrong?[lr]::
49280::$$$message_0425_0020_0003$$$::Is it fake because it's not my own feelings?[lr]::
49281::$$$message_0425_0020_0004$$$::Is it wrong for that wish to come true if it's fake?::
49282::$$$message_0425_0021_0000$$$::    No. I don't think it's wrong.::
49283::$$$message_0425_0022_0000$$$::"A...ahhh."::
49284::$$$message_0425_0023_0000$$$::I don't care if it's fake.[lr]::
49285::$$$message_0425_0023_0001$$$::Even unattainable ideals just need to be fulfilled.[lr]::
49286::$$$message_0425_0023_0002$$$::It was a dream that couldn't be granted from the start. An unreachable utopia.::
49287::$$$message_0425_0024_0000$$$::                                Then, even if Shirou Emiya is a fake...[lr]::
49288::$$$message_0425_0024_0001$$$::                               The thing that is there is undeniably real.::
49289::$$$message_0425_0025_0000$$$::"That's right. I already knew that."::
49290::$$$message_0425_0026_0000$$$::I know I can't save everything.[lr]::
49291::$$$message_0425_0026_0001$$$::I know that there's no salvation without sacrifice.[lr]::
49292::$$$message_0425_0026_0002$$$::Now that I'm an adult, I understand that's reality.[lr]::
49293::$$$message_0425_0026_0003$$$::Despite knowing that such a thing was only an ideal, I continued to seek for it.::
49294::$$$message_0425_0027_0000$$$::It doesn't end when someone gets hurt.[lr]::
49295::$$$message_0425_0027_0001$$$::Even if the best outcome is for someone to get hurt in order to save many, I'm still going to seek a version of happiness where nobody gets hurt.[lr]::
49296::$$$message_0425_0027_0002$$$::There's no justice in this world...[lr]::
49297::$$$message_0425_0027_0003$$$::The reality is that people keep dying for nothing...[lr]::
49298::$$$message_0425_0027_0004$$$::But I don't think resigning to that idea is right!::
49299::$$$message_0425_0028_0000$$$::                                And in the end, he reached this place.::
49300::$$$message_0425_0029_0000$$$::What he believes...[lr]::
49301::$$$message_0425_0029_0001$$$::What he believed...[lr]::
49302::$$$message_0425_0029_0002$$$::He said they were all hypocrisy.::
49303::$$$message_0425_0030_0000$$$::But the one who said that followed through on his hypocrisy till the end.[lr]::
49304::$$$message_0425_0030_0001$$$::...Knowing that, I can keep going.[lr]::
49305::$$$message_0425_0030_0002$$$::Even if I borrowed his ideals...even if I'm going to stay a fake...I don't care.[lr]::
49306::$$$message_0425_0030_0003$$$::I don't have such complicated feelings that I have to worry about too much in the first place.::
49307::$$$message_0425_0031_0000$$$::I thought to myself on the hill of swords.[lr]::
49308::$$$message_0425_0031_0001$$$::If I could save just the world that I can see, I'll fight for it.[lr]::
49309::$$$message_0425_0031_0002$$$::I didn't even have to think about it.[lr]::
49310::$$$message_0425_0031_0003$$$::My world is small.[lr]::
49311::$$$message_0425_0031_0004$$$::This small world is all I have ever been able to create.::
49312::$$$message_0425_0032_0000$$$::                                   That's right.[lr]::
49313::$$$message_0425_0032_0001$$$::                                   This body of mine is made of solid swords.::
49314::$$$message_0425_0033_0000$$$::Yeah. That's why I'll be able to endure most things.[lr]::
49315::$$$message_0425_0033_0001$$$::I can stick to my dreams until the very end.[lr]::
49316::$$$message_0425_0033_0002$$$::Even the wear and tear over the years.[lr]::
49317::$$$message_0425_0033_0003$$$::And even if at the end...[lr]::
49318::$$$message_0425_0033_0004$$$::None of what I sought was there.::
49319::$$$message_0425_0034_0000$$$::"Oh. So that's it."[lr]::
49320::$$$message_0425_0034_0001$$$::"What!?"::
49321::$$$message_0425_0035_0000$$$::I get up.[lr]::
49322::$$$message_0425_0035_0001$$$::The moment I regain consciousness, my limbs move.[lr]::
49323::$$$message_0425_0035_0002$$$::My body still moves after I get up with great force.[lr]::
49324::$$$message_0425_0035_0003$$$::It's a wonder I'm not only alive but able to stand up after that sword's blow... but it doesn't matter.::
49325::$$$message_0425_0036_0000$$$::If I'm alive, there must be a reason why.[lr]::
49326::$$$message_0425_0036_0001$$$::It's something that I just have no control over.::
49327::$$$message_0425_0037_0000$$$::"Did you put up a shield right before? I may have been reluctant to use my sword, but it should still have been fatal.[lr]::
49328::$$$message_0425_0037_0001$$$::I knew you were persistent, boy."::
49329::$$$message_0425_0038_0000$$$::"You were reluctant? Heh. Why would you hold back when you have mounds of weapons at bay?"::
49330::$$$message_0425_0039_0000$$$::I steady my breath while keeping my distance.[lr]::
49331::$$$message_0425_0039_0001$$$::I know how to do it now.[lr]::
49332::$$$message_0425_0039_0002$$$::I'm sure I can do it with Tohsaka's backup.[lr]::
49333::$$$message_0425_0039_0003$$$::The problem would be my casting time.[lr]::
49334::$$$message_0425_0039_0004$$$::I may have memorized it, but I don't know how fast I can get it to work for me unless I try.::
49335::$$$message_0425_0040_0000$$$::"Hmph. Only the supreme ruler is allowed to use that sword.[lr]::
49336::$$$message_0425_0040_0001$$$::I showed it to you for my amusement, but it is not something to be used against a mongrel like you.[lr]::
49337::$$$message_0425_0040_0002$$$::The only person who has the right to exchange blows with Ea is Saber.[lr]::
49338::$$$message_0425_0040_0003$$$::I would have been unable to face Saber had I used it on a fake like you."::
49339::$$$message_0425_0041_0000$$$::Numerous Noble Phantasms appear.[lr]::
49340::$$$message_0425_0041_0001$$$::But all of them are third-rate weapons.[lr]::
49341::$$$message_0425_0041_0002$$$::After seeing the sword I just saw, the difference is obvious.::
49342::$$$message_0425_0042_0000$$$::But those weapons are still not to be taken lightly.[lr]::
49343::$$$message_0425_0042_0001$$$::Normally they would be more than enough to kill me.[lr]::
49344::$$$message_0425_0042_0002$$$::   The difference in our strength has not changed.[lr]::
49345::$$$message_0425_0042_0003$$$::Even though I miraculously survived that last attack, I'm no match against that Servant with just my Projection.::
49346::$$$message_0425_0043_0000$$$::"Oh? Are you done playing pretend? So you've finally realized your efforts are useless...[lr]::
49347::$$$message_0425_0043_0001$$$::Then disappear without a trace. I will not leave a single piece of cranium that makes you a fake!"::
49348::$$$message_0425_0044_0000$$$::The floating Noble Phantasms are deployed.[lr]::
49349::$$$message_0425_0044_0001$$$::But then...[lr]::
49350::$$$message_0425_0044_0002$$$::"Shirou!"[lr]::
49351::$$$message_0425_0044_0003$$$::A gust of blue wind intervenes between us.::
49352::$$$message_0425_0045_0000$$$::"Saber!?"[lr]::
49353::$$$message_0425_0045_0001$$$::Gilgamesh instantly jumps back.[lr]::
49354::$$$message_0425_0045_0002$$$::Even Gilgamesh is cautious against Saber.[lr]::
49355::$$$message_0425_0045_0003$$$::Seeing as his swordsmanship is inferior, he probably wants to avoid hand-to-hand combat with Saber.::
49356::$$$message_0425_0046_0000$$$::"I am relieved. Are you all right, Shirou?[lr]::
49357::$$$message_0425_0046_0001$$$::I apologize for my delay. I shall take over now. Please stand back, Shirou."::
49358::$$$message_0425_0047_0000$$$::"No. I'm going to take care of Gilgamesh alone. You're the one who's going to step back, Saber."::
49359::$$$message_0425_0048_0000$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
49360::$$$message_0425_0048_0001$$$::"What!?"::
49361::$$$message_0425_0049_0000$$$::"Wh-what are you saying, Shirou!?[lr]::
49362::$$$message_0425_0049_0001$$$::Do you intend to fight him in your current state? No. A mage cannot contend against Servants in the first place. You should know that."::
49363::$$$message_0425_0050_0000$$$::"Yeah. But he and I are an exception. Believe me.[lr]::
49364::$$$message_0425_0050_0001$$$::I'm sure I can beat him."[lr]::
49365::$$$message_0425_0050_0002$$$::Saber gasps.[lr]::
49366::$$$message_0425_0050_0003$$$::Saber is surprised because she believes what I'm saying.::
49367::$$$message_0425_0051_0000$$$::"I want you to quickly get to the back of the compound. Tohsaka's trying to stop the grail on her own. But you're the only one who can destroy that thing."[lr]::
49368::$$$message_0425_0051_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
49369::$$$message_0425_0051_0002$$$::A few seconds...no, not even a second passed.[lr]::
49370::$$$message_0425_0051_0003$$$::After she tightly closed her eyes once...::
49371::$$$message_0425_0052_0000$$$::"I wish you luck. I will be sure to aid Rin."[lr]::
49372::$$$message_0425_0052_0001$$$::She says exactly what I want to hear, and steps away from Gilgamesh.::
49373::$$$message_0425_0053_0000$$$::The silver armor turns away.[lr]::
49374::$$$message_0425_0053_0001$$$::"Saber."[lr]::
49375::$$$message_0425_0053_0002$$$::I call out to her just once.::
49376::$$$message_0425_0054_0000$$$::"I couldn't save you..."[lr]::
49377::$$$message_0425_0054_0001$$$::And I say it.[lr]::
49378::$$$message_0425_0054_0002$$$::I'm going to try to tell her on behalf of the times I spent with her and the times he spent thinking of her...::
49379::$$$message_0425_0055_0000$$$::"I don't think that Holy Grail is the one you seek.[lr]::
49380::$$$message_0425_0055_0001$$$::That's why you should take a good look at it. So you won't make a mistake next time."[lr]::
49381::$$$message_0425_0055_0002$$$::"...Shirou?"::
49382::$$$message_0425_0056_0000$$$::"Sorry. I can't put it into words well. I don't think I was worthy to be your Master.[lr]::
49383::$$$message_0425_0056_0001$$$::That's why..."[lr]::
49384::$$$message_0425_0056_0002$$$::I couldn't even find out what she really wanted.::
49385::$$$message_0425_0057_0000$$$::"That is not true. Shirou. You are my Master."[lr]::
49386::$$$message_0425_0057_0001$$$::"...Saber."[lr]::
49387::$$$message_0425_0057_0002$$$::"I will fulfill my duty as a Servant. If there is anything you want to tell me, we shall talk afterwards."::
49388::$$$message_0425_0058_0000$$$::She runs off without turning back.[lr]::
49389::$$$message_0425_0058_0001$$$::Her gallant appearance is like a gust of wind.::
49390::$$$message_0425_0059_0000$$$::Saber left.[lr]::
49391::$$$message_0425_0059_0001$$$::Without the slightest doubt, she believed my words when I said I would beat my opponent, and left to save Tohsaka.::
49392::$$$message_0425_0060_0000$$$::    All right. Let's go.::
49393::$$$message_0425_0061_0000$$$::From here on, there's no room for hesitation.[lr]::
49394::$$$message_0425_0061_0001$$$::All I need to do is to defeat the enemy in front of me.::
49395::$$$message_0425_0062_0000$$$::"Fu...hahahahahahahahaahah!!!"::
49396::$$$message_0425_0063_0000$$$::"Are you sane? You just let go of your one chance at victory so you can save that girl!?[lr]::
49397::$$$message_0425_0063_0001$$$::You fool. Acts of self-sacrifice are nothing but falsehood. If you still do not realize that, then you are a bona fide hypocrite.[lr]::
49398::$$$message_0425_0063_0002$$$::Ah yes...I'll praise you just on that front, boy."::
49399::$$$message_0425_0064_0000$$$::His Noble Phantasms deploy.[lr]::
49400::$$$message_0425_0064_0001$$$::   There're less than thirty of them.[lr]::
49401::$$$message_0425_0064_0002$$$::If I want to block them, I'll just have to create them.::
49402::$$$message_0425_0065_0000$$$::"An imitation...a hypocrite, huh? Yeah, that doesn't sound bad. It's true: I am a faker."[lr]::
49403::$$$message_0425_0065_0001$$$::I raise one of my arms.[lr]::
49404::$$$message_0425_0065_0002$$$::I close one eye and turn my mind to look within.::
49405::$$$message_0425_0066_0000$$$::"Hn?"[lr]::
49406::$$$message_0425_0066_0001$$$::"I had it all wrong. My Projection wasn't making swords. I'm not that skilled to begin with."::
49407::$$$message_0425_0067_0000$$$::That's right.[lr]::
49408::$$$message_0425_0067_0001$$$::Tohsaka told me this. I can only use one kind of magecraft.[lr]::
49409::$$$message_0425_0067_0002$$$::Strengthening and Projection are just by-products of what I actually do.::
49410::$$$message_0425_0068_0000$$$::"That's right. There's only one thing I can do, and that's to give shape to what's in my heart."[lr]::
49411::$$$message_0425_0068_0001$$$::I turn.[lr]::
49412::$$$message_0425_0068_0002$$$::I grab my outstretched right arm with my left hand and glare at Gilgamesh.::
49413::$$$message_0425_0069_0000$$$::"I am the bone of my sword..."[lr]::
49414::$$$message_0425_0069_0001$$$::I say the spell.[lr]::
49415::$$$message_0425_0069_0002$$$::Casting is only a method of suggestion to change oneself.[lr]::
49416::$$$message_0425_0069_0003$$$::These words were naturally there to connect me.::
49417::$$$message_0425_0070_0000$$$::"Well. That is enough of this nonsense."[lr]::
49418::$$$message_0425_0070_0001$$$::Numerous Noble Phantasms get released.[lr]::
49419::$$$message_0425_0070_0002$$$::   I create.[lr]::
49420::$$$message_0425_0070_0003$$$::That's why I had one eye open.[lr]::
49421::$$$message_0425_0070_0004$$$::I drag out a shield from the hill to block the oncoming Noble Phantasms.::
49422::$$$message_0425_0071_0000$$$::"Gngh...!"[lr]::
49423::$$$message_0425_0071_0001$$$::The swarm of swords strike wildly.[lr]::
49424::$$$message_0425_0071_0002$$$::The shield is Shirou Emiya...myself.[lr]::
49425::$$$message_0425_0071_0003$$$::The seven petal shield cracks, and my body chips away with every fracture.::
49426::$$$message_0425_0072_0000$$$::"Steel is my body, and fire is... ::
49427::$$$message_0425_0072_0001$$$::my blood."[lr]::
49428::$$$message_0425_0072_0002$$$::There's only one place I need to reach.[lr]::
49429::$$$message_0425_0072_0003$$$::The power that surges forth immediately fills me to capacity.::
49430::$$$message_0425_0073_0000$$$::"Wha...t!?"[lr]::
49431::$$$message_0425_0073_0001$$$::What is he so surprised about?[lr]::
49432::$$$message_0425_0073_0002$$$::Is he shocked that his treasure can't even penetrate through my single shield? Or is he surprised by the rush of magical energy?::
49433::$$$message_0425_0074_0000$$$::"I have created over a thousand blades.[r]::
49434::$$$message_0425_0074_0001$$$::Unaware of loss.[r]::
49435::$$$message_0425_0074_0002$$$::Nor aware of gain."::
49436::$$$message_0425_0075_0000$$$::It's going to break.[lr]::
49437::$$$message_0425_0075_0001$$$::The surging magical energy can't be suppressed.[lr]::
49438::$$$message_0425_0075_0002$$$::Ten units of magical energy filling a single Magic Circuit break the foundation to find release.::
49439::$$$message_0425_0075_0003$$$::"I cannot break through...!?"[lr]::
49440::$$$message_0425_0075_0004$$$::My blood flows backwards.[lr]::
49441::$$$message_0425_0075_0005$$$::The shield is full of holes.[lr]::
49442::$$$message_0425_0075_0006$$$::Even if his Noble Phantasms do not reach me, my body is full of holes already.[lr]::
49443::$$$message_0425_0075_0007$$$::And yet...::
49444::$$$message_0425_0075_0008$$$::"Withstood pain to create weapons.[r]::
49445::$$$message_0425_0075_0009$$$::Waiting for one's arrival."::
49446::$$$message_0425_0075_0010$$$::Magical energy rages out of control.[lr]::
49447::$$$message_0425_0075_0011$$$::But I don't care.[lr]::
49448::$$$message_0425_0075_0012$$$::My body is a circuit that solely exists to use a certain magecraft, and that magecraft alone.[lr]::
49449::$$$message_0425_0075_0013$$$::So there should be something beyond that.[lr]::
49450::$$$message_0425_0075_0014$$$::There should be something beyond that if I can't make it with this circuit.::
49451::$$$message_0425_0076_0000$$$::No. Even now it's there.[lr]::
49452::$$$message_0425_0076_0001$$$::It's just not visible.[lr]::
49453::$$$message_0425_0076_0002$$$::There were no circuit limitations from the very beginning.[lr]::
49454::$$$message_0425_0076_0003$$$::If what was preventing it was not a wall, but darkness...[lr]::
49455::$$$message_0425_0076_0004$$$::Then the limit is somewhere beyond the darkness.::
49456::$$$message_0425_0077_0000$$$::"I have no regrets. This is the only path."::
49457::$$$message_0425_0078_0000$$$::Ten units of magical energy filling a single Magic Circuit break the foundation to find release, and I will use one hundred circuits to take in a thousand units of magical energy.::
49458::$$$message_0425_0079_0000$$$::"My whole life was unlimited blade works."::
49459::$$$message_0425_0080_0000$$$::I say its True Name.[lr]::
49460::$$$message_0425_0080_0001$$$::In that instant...[lr]::
49461::$$$message_0425_0080_0002$$$::Everything shatters and regenerates.::
49462::$$$message_0425_0081_0000$$$::   Flames rush.[lr]::
49463::$$$message_0425_0081_0001$$$::The fire becomes a wall that creates a boundary, and changes the world.[lr]::
49464::$$$message_0425_0081_0002$$$::A wasteland follows.[lr]::
49465::$$$message_0425_0081_0003$$$::A hill with countless swords in disarray reveals itself before me.::
49466::$$$message_0425_0082_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
49467::$$$message_0425_0082_0001$$$::How does this place look to that guy?[lr]::
49468::$$$message_0425_0082_0002$$$::The golden Servant simply stands there with a seething look on his face and confronts his enemy.::
49469::$$$message_0425_0083_0000$$$::"That's right. I don't make swords.[lr]::
49470::$$$message_0425_0083_0001$$$::I create a world that contains infinite swords.[lr]::
49471::$$$message_0425_0083_0002$$$::This is the only magecraft allowed to me."::
49472::$$$message_0425_0084_0000$$$::A desolate world.[lr]::
49473::$$$message_0425_0084_0001$$$::A graveyard where there are no living creatures...only swords.[lr]::
49474::$$$message_0425_0084_0002$$$::In this world where swords get replicated just by looking directly at them, every sword in existence is here.::
49475::$$$message_0425_0085_0000$$$::This is Shirou Emiya's world.[lr]::
49476::$$$message_0425_0085_0001$$$::A Reality Marble.[lr]::
49477::$$$message_0425_0085_0002$$$::The greatest forbidden magecraft that materializes the caster's mental world.[lr]::
49478::$$$message_0425_0085_0003$$$::This is the Heroic Spirit Emiya's Noble Phantasm, and the only weapon I possess.::
49479::$$$message_0425_0086_0000$$$::Everything is here, and nothing is here.[lr]::
49480::$$$message_0425_0086_0001$$$::That's why it's called Unlimited Blade Works.[r]::
49481::$$$message_0425_0086_0002$$$::As someone who lived his whole life as a sword, this is the only definite and tangible answer he was able to obtain.::
49482::$$$message_0425_0087_0000$$$::"A Reality Marble. So this is your ability!"[lr]::
49483::$$$message_0425_0087_0001$$$::I take a step forward.[lr]::
49484::$$$message_0425_0087_0002$$$::Surrounding me are the swords that were floating behind him earlier.::
49485::$$$message_0425_0088_0000$$$::"Don't be surprised. These are all imitations.[lr]::
49486::$$$message_0425_0088_0001$$$::Just as you said, they're all trifling objects."[lr]::
49487::$$$message_0425_0088_0002$$$::I stretch out my arms.[lr]::
49488::$$$message_0425_0088_0003$$$::The swords stuck in the ground come out easily, as if accepting me as their wielder.::
49489::$$$message_0425_0089_0000$$$::"But you know what? There's no rule or reason a fake can't best the real thing.[lr]::
49490::$$$message_0425_0089_0001$$$::If you're the real thing, then I'll surpass you completely and strike down your very existence."[lr]::
49491::$$$message_0425_0089_0002$$$::I step forward.[lr]::
49492::$$$message_0425_0089_0003$$$::In front of me is the Servant who possesses thousands of treasures.::
49493::$$$message_0425_0090_0000$$$::      "Let's do this, King of Heroes. Do you have enough weapons in stock?"::
49494::$$$message_0425_0091_0000$$$::"Ha. Surely you are conceited, mongrel!!!"[lr]::
49495::$$$message_0425_0091_0001$$$::The enemy opens his gate and deploys numerous Noble Phantasms.[lr]::
49496::$$$message_0425_0091_0002$$$::I charge through the wasteland.[lr]::
49497::$$$message_0425_0091_0003$$$::Here, the two different groups of swords begin their final clash.H“ëö
