52403::$$$message_0449_0000_0000$$$::"That's why I'm saying, people get upset when you tell them the truth."::
52404::$$$message_0449_0001_0000$$$::Tohsaka pokes at my lunch thoughtfully.[lr]::
52405::$$$message_0449_0001_0001$$$::She came here empty-handed today,[lr]::
52406::$$$message_0449_0001_0002$$$::meaning that she doesn't have anything to eat.[lr]::
52407::$$$message_0449_0001_0003$$$::It was inevitable that she'd come after my lunch, instead.::
52408::$$$message_0449_0002_0000$$$::"Just eat... Why do you have chopsticks with you when you didn't even bring lunch? Do you always carry those around?"::
52409::$$$message_0449_0003_0000$$$::"? I brought these with me when I left class. You had food with you last time, so I figured we'd just split it today. I needed utensils in case you packed your own lunch."::
52410::$$$message_0449_0004_0000$$$::"...Um, I think you have your priorities out of order."[lr]::
52411::$$$message_0449_0004_0001$$$::If you thought that far ahead, then [font italic=true]bring your own dang lunch![font italic=false]::
52412::$$$message_0449_0005_0000$$$::"Don't sweat the small stuff. I know you packed enough food for two, so it worked out for everyone."::
52413::$$$message_0449_0006_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
52414::$$$message_0449_0006_0001$$$::This isn't really meant for two people to share.[lr]::
52415::$$$message_0449_0006_0002$$$::Sakura just happened to put too much food in the box.::
52416::$$$message_0449_0007_0000$$$::"...Whatever. You're right that I can't finish this on my own. Oh, Tohsaka, don't just eat the veggies. You should take some meat. I'll get bloated if I eat all the meat."::
52417::$$$message_0449_0008_0000$$$::"Aww, but that fried chicken's too sweet for me.[lr]::
52418::$$$message_0449_0008_0001$$$::Also, don't pressure girls to eat meat. We can figure out our own portions. If we say we don't want it, that's a stop sign."::
52419::$$$message_0449_0009_0000$$$::"Liar. I bet you're the type that doesn't hold back when you're in front of the grill. I know I'm right. While I'm still on the appetizers, you'd be scarfing down the galbi like there's no tomorrow.[lr]::
52420::$$$message_0449_0009_0001$$$::I can tell you wouldn't give a damn about my wallet. In fact, you'd try to bankrupt me. And once you're done, you'd say 'I held back for your sake this time.'"[lr]::
52421::$$$message_0449_0009_0002$$$::I huff and shoot back a retort, feeling like a sore loser.::
52422::$$$message_0449_0010_0000$$$::"...Well said, Emiya. It's scary how I can't even deny everything you said."[lr]::
52423::$$$message_0449_0010_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
52424::$$$message_0449_0010_0002$$$::No...[lr]::
52425::$$$message_0449_0010_0003$$$::I'm pretty sure the scary one here is you.::
52426::$$$message_0449_0011_0000$$$::"What a weird lunch, though. The portions are huge, but the garnishes and wrappings are so girly. Do you enjoy cooking?"[lr]::
52427::$$$message_0449_0011_0001$$$::What a coincidence.[lr]::
52428::$$$message_0449_0011_0002$$$::Someone asked me the same thing this morning.::
52429::$$$message_0449_0012_0000$$$::"...I don't dislike it, but Sakura's the one who made my lunch today.[lr]::
52430::$$$message_0449_0012_0001$$$::Oh, Sakura is..."[lr]::
52431::$$$message_0449_0012_0002$$$::"...Tohsaka? What's wrong? Did you bite on a lump of sugar or something?"[lr]::
52432::$$$message_0449_0012_0003$$$::"Aw, crap. Now I've done it."[lr]::
52433::$$$message_0449_0012_0004$$$::Tohsaka sighs and puts away her chopsticks.::
52434::$$$message_0449_0013_0000$$$::"Thanks for sharing your lunch. You can finish the rest on your own."[lr]::
52435::$$$message_0449_0013_0001$$$::Tohsaka backs away uncomfortably.::
52436::$$$message_0449_0014_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
52437::$$$message_0449_0014_0001$$$::Well, as long as she's full.[lr]::
52438::$$$message_0449_0014_0002$$$::I was getting pretty nervous eating side by side with her, so it'll be nice to enjoy it in peace.::
52439::$$$message_0449_0015_0000$$$::I'm on the way back to class.[lr]::
52440::$$$message_0449_0015_0001$$$::Fifth period starts in a few minutes. The hall leading back to my classroom is crammed with students.::
52441::$$$message_0449_0016_0000$$$::On the other hand, the stairs are quiet.[lr]::
52442::$$$message_0449_0016_0001$$$::There aren't many students who visit other years' floors during lunch, so people use the stairs only occasionally.[lr]::
52443::$$$message_0449_0016_0002$$$::On the way back down,[lr]::
52444::$$$message_0449_0016_0003$$$::I run into Sakura.::
52445::$$$message_0449_0017_0000$$$::As soon as she sees me, she looks away awkwardly.[lr]::
52446::$$$message_0449_0017_0001$$$::"...?"[lr]::
52447::$$$message_0449_0017_0002$$$::I wonder why.[lr]::
52448::$$$message_0449_0017_0003$$$::It's the opposite of how energetic she looked this morning.::
52449::$$$message_0449_0018_0000$$$::"Sakura[line2]"[lr]::
52450::$$$message_0449_0018_0001$$$::I speak to her,[lr]::
52451::$$$message_0449_0018_0002$$$::but before I can say anything else...::
52452::$$$message_0449_0019_0000$$$::"Sorry, Sakura. That was poor timing on my part."[lr]::
52453::$$$message_0449_0019_0001$$$::Tohsaka interjects first.::
52454::$$$message_0449_0020_0000$$$::"Oh... N-no, you didn't do anything wrong. It isn't any of my business whether the two of you[line2]"::
52455::$$$message_0449_0021_0000$$$::"That's not what this is. I called Emiya out because I had business with him. Also, he didn't break his promise to you. He was just oblivious."[lr]::
52456::$$$message_0449_0021_0001$$$::"...Um. What's that supposed to mean? I never promised her anything[line2]"::
52457::$$$message_0449_0022_0000$$$::"Listen, stupid. Sakura made you lunch because she wanted to eat with you. Of course she would be upset."[lr]::
52458::$$$message_0449_0022_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
52459::$$$message_0449_0022_0002$$$::W-wait a second.[lr]::
52460::$$$message_0449_0022_0003$$$::When did I ever say I would...::
52461::$$$message_0449_0023_0000$$$::"...U-um, Senpai? What about having lunch at the range?[lr]::
52462::$$$message_0449_0023_0001$$$::The club building's open during the day, you can make tea there, and, um, it's quiet and there's nobody around, so..."::
52463::$$$message_0449_0024_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
52464::$$$message_0449_0024_0001$$$::I notice that Sakura hasn't unwrapped her lunch yet.::
52465::$$$message_0449_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
52466::$$$message_0449_0025_0001$$$::Oh, right.[lr]::
52467::$$$message_0449_0025_0002$$$::What the hell am I saying!? Of [font italic=true]course[font italic=false] Tohsaka would call me stupid!::
52468::$$$message_0449_0026_0000$$$::"Sorry, Sakura! I'm such an idiot!"[lr]::
52469::$$$message_0449_0026_0001$$$::"N-no. It's okay. I mean, we didn't actually agree to meet up. I just thought it would be nice if we did[line2]"::
52470::$$$message_0449_0027_0000$$$::"It's not okay! Let's go right now! There's still time![lr]::
52471::$$$message_0449_0027_0001$$$::We'll get it done in the dojo right away[line2]"[lr]::
52472::$$$message_0449_0027_0002$$$::I grab Sakura's hand and start to run.::
52473::$$$message_0449_0028_0000$$$::However...[lr]::
52474::$$$message_0449_0028_0001$$$::"You obviously don't have enough time. What can you do in three minutes?"::
52475::$$$message_0449_0029_0000$$$::"Argh."[lr]::
52476::$$$message_0449_0029_0001$$$::Tohsaka's calm logic stops me cold.[lr]::
52477::$$$message_0449_0029_0002$$$::My guilt over standing Sakura up drove me to action, but Tohsaka's one hundred percent right.::
52478::$$$message_0449_0030_0000$$$::"It's all right, Senpai. We have to go back to class."[lr]::
52479::$$$message_0449_0030_0001$$$::"But, Sakura..."::
52480::$$$message_0449_0031_0000$$$::"Please, don't worry. I'm already happy enough right now. Thank you."[lr]::
52481::$$$message_0449_0031_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
52482::$$$message_0449_0031_0002$$$::I don't know what to say to that.::
52483::$$$message_0449_0032_0000$$$::"I'll be going now. You should get back to class too before you're late."[lr]::
52484::$$$message_0449_0032_0001$$$::Sakura goes up the stairs with her uneaten lunch.::
52485::$$$message_0449_0033_0000$$$::"I'm going too.[lr]::
52486::$$$message_0449_0033_0001$$$::Once school's out, go straight to the Chinese restaurant in the shopping district. I'll wait for you there."::
52487::$$$message_0449_0034_0000$$$::And so...[lr]::
52488::$$$message_0449_0034_0001$$$::Tohsaka goes back to her classroom, leaving me with those cryptic instructions.::
52489::$$$message_0449_0035_0000$$$::Fifth period ends, and the classroom quickly empties.[lr]::
52490::$$$message_0449_0035_0001$$$::It's still before 2:00 PM.::
52491::$$$message_0449_0036_0000$$$::"...Phew. I don't feel like going, but Tohsaka told me to."[lr]::
52492::$$$message_0449_0036_0001$$$::I don't have anything left to do on campus, so I go for broke and head to the shopping district.::¡
