35745::$$$message_0295_0000_0000$$$::    So...[lr]::
35746::$$$message_0295_0000_0001$$$::This is the Tohsaka household's living room, where Rin Tohsaka spends her daily life.::
35747::$$$message_0295_0001_0000$$$::"Show me your arm."[lr]::
35748::$$$message_0295_0001_0001$$$::She gets straight to the point.[lr]::
35749::$$$message_0295_0001_0002$$$::"...Thanks."[lr]::
35750::$$$message_0295_0001_0003$$$::I sit on the chair and put my right arm out.::
35751::$$$message_0295_0002_0000$$$::She takes off the towel that was wrapped around it.[lr]::
35752::$$$message_0295_0002_0001$$$::...It feels like she's even closer now than before.[lr]::
35753::$$$message_0295_0002_0002$$$::With Tohsaka tending to my arm right in front of me, I can't help but notice how beautiful her black hair is, and it makes my heart beat faster.::
35754::$$$message_0295_0003_0000$$$::"...Huh? That's weird, the wound is smaller than earlier. Did you put some self-healing spell on yourself?"[lr]::
35755::$$$message_0295_0003_0001$$$::"Huh? No, I-I definitely didn't!"[lr]::
35756::$$$message_0295_0003_0002$$$::"Really? But take a look at it, your wound is already pretty much healed."[lr]::
35757::$$$message_0295_0003_0003$$$::"I didn't say anything about it being pretty[line2] wait, what did you just say?"::
35758::$$$message_0295_0004_0000$$$::"I said your wound is pretty much healed. All I did was stop the bleeding, so it shouldn't be like this at all."::
35759::$$$message_0295_0005_0000$$$::"Hm... But I don't know anything about this."[lr]::
35760::$$$message_0295_0005_0001$$$::"...You sure? There was something like this before, but you really don't have a clue?"::
35761::$$$message_0295_0006_0000$$$::"Wait, I'm even more confused. Something like this happened before? When?"::
35762::$$$message_0295_0007_0000$$$::"It was the other day.[lr]::
35763::$$$message_0295_0007_0001$$$::When Berserker attacked, a piece of glass pierced your back, right?[lr]::
35764::$$$message_0295_0007_0002$$$::After that, your wound healed without me having to do anything.[lr]::
35765::$$$message_0295_0007_0003$$$::...Well, I thought it might be your own magecraft, but you're not that skilled."::
35766::$$$message_0295_0008_0000$$$::"Yeah, yeah, sorry I'm not up to your standards... But what does this mean? I've never had such a thing happen to me before."::
35767::$$$message_0295_0009_0000$$$::"...Hmm. The only thing I can think of is the contract you made with Saber. I don't know what kind of contract you formed, but there's some Servants that make their contractor immortal.[lr]::
35768::$$$message_0295_0009_0001$$$::Saber's healing powers might be flowing inside of you, too."::
35769::$$$message_0295_0010_0000$$$::"...Hm. Then, as long as I'm in a contract with Saber, then even if I get hurt, I would be fine?"::
35770::$$$message_0295_0011_0000$$$::"...Well, that's what it would mean, but... You shouldn't rely on it. Saber is the one healing your wounds, so that would mean you're consuming her magical energy.[lr]::
35771::$$$message_0295_0011_0001$$$::And more to the point, it's a power to heal wounds. It doesn't bring you back to life. If you die, you don't get another chance, so don't do such a reckless thing again."::
35772::$$$message_0295_0012_0000$$$::While she says all this...[lr]::
35773::$$$message_0295_0012_0001$$$::Before I even know it, she's finished her treatment and rebandaged my arm.[lr]::
35774::$$$message_0295_0012_0002$$$::She taps my arm and stands.::
