60510::$$$message_0550_0000_0000$$$::The girl returns to her bedroom.[lr]::
60511::$$$message_0550_0000_0001$$$::She goes to her bed with heavy steps and sits down limply.::
60512::$$$message_0550_0001_0000$$$::"...Senpai's hurt so badly, and he still..."[lr]::
60513::$$$message_0550_0001_0001$$$::She doesn't know what happened.[lr]::
60514::$$$message_0550_0001_0002$$$::She just knows that the boy left and came back a few hours later looking haggard and covered in wounds.[lr]::
60515::$$$message_0550_0001_0003$$$::The blonde girl who suddenly appeared in this house a few days ago didn't return with him.[lr]::
60516::$$$message_0550_0001_0004$$$::From this alone, it's clear that something irrevocable has happened.[lr]::
60517::$$$message_0550_0001_0005$$$::The boy is hiding something, and as a result, the blonde girl didn't come back.::
60518::$$$message_0550_0002_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
60519::$$$message_0550_0002_0001$$$::But that doesn't matter.[lr]::
60520::$$$message_0550_0002_0002$$$::She doesn't care about that at all.[lr]::
60521::$$$message_0550_0002_0003$$$::As long the boy is back safe, then she doesn't need to know what happened.[lr]::
60522::$$$message_0550_0002_0004$$$::Nothing could make her happier than Shirou Emiya coming home to her.::
60523::$$$message_0550_0003_0000$$$::"Wait...was it this cold today...?"[lr]::
60524::$$$message_0550_0003_0001$$$::She feels a chill, and touches her cheek.[lr]::
60525::$$$message_0550_0003_0002$$$::...It's hot.[lr]::
60526::$$$message_0550_0003_0003$$$::Her whole body feels hot, and she feels like she might faint if she doesn't concentrate.[lr]::
60527::$$$message_0550_0003_0004$$$::It must be a cold again.[lr]::
60528::$$$message_0550_0003_0005$$$::That's unusual, since she doesn't usually catch colds, but she was waiting at the door for almost three hours. ::
60529::$$$message_0550_0004_0000$$$::"...Ngh..."[lr]::
60530::$$$message_0550_0004_0001$$$::Sluggishly, she turns off the lights.[lr]::
60531::$$$message_0550_0004_0002$$$::Too tired to even change out of her clothes, she collapses into bed.::
60532::$$$message_0550_0005_0000$$$::"It's okay. Compared to what Senpai's going through, this is nothing..."[lr]::
60533::$$$message_0550_0005_0001$$$::Lying face down, the girl thinks back to the scene a few minutes ago.[lr]::
60534::$$$message_0550_0005_0002$$$::...His back looked like someone worked it over with a cheese grater.[lr]::
60535::$$$message_0550_0005_0003$$$::...His stomach was bruised black, as if struck by a heavy, blunt weapon.[lr]::
60536::$$$message_0550_0005_0004$$$::...He had to have been wounded in both body and spirit, yet his gaze was as clear as day.::
60537::$$$message_0550_0006_0000$$$::The moment she remembers, she feels her body temperature rise. [lr]::
60538::$$$message_0550_0006_0001$$$::She pretends not to notice that it's hatred she feels, not excitement.::
60539::$$$message_0550_0007_0000$$$::"Who did that...?"[lr]::
60540::$$$message_0550_0007_0001$$$::...Yes.[lr]::
60541::$$$message_0550_0007_0002$$$::She can't forgive whoever hurt him this badly.[lr]::
60542::$$$message_0550_0007_0003$$$::This goes beyond momentary feelings like hatred or disapproval.[lr]::
60543::$$$message_0550_0007_0004$$$::He's always been deeply hurt, and yet, he's always stayed here with her, so pristine.[lr]::
60544::$$$message_0550_0007_0005$$$::He's someone so different from her yet so precious, so she can't abide the fact that someone hurt him.::
60545::$$$message_0550_0008_0000$$$::"Mm...but...Senpai's back was amazing..."[lr]::
60546::$$$message_0550_0008_0001$$$::She absently reaches out with her hand.[lr]::
60547::$$$message_0550_0008_0002$$$::It's been a long time since she saw his bare skin up close.[lr]::
60548::$$$message_0550_0008_0003$$$::When they first met, he was small for a boy, and not much taller than her.[lr]::
60549::$$$message_0550_0008_0004$$$::But for the last two years, he has rapidly become a man.::
60550::$$$message_0550_0009_0000$$$::"...Mm."::
60551::$$$message_0550_0010_0000$$$::It wasn't like before, when he collapsed from a cold.[lr]::
60552::$$$message_0550_0010_0001$$$::That was only a common cold.[lr]::
60553::$$$message_0550_0010_0002$$$::Tonight, he was a wounded man.::
60554::$$$message_0550_0011_0000$$$::"Senpai..."[lr]::
60555::$$$message_0550_0011_0001$$$::Her mind goes blank as she remembers.[lr]::
60556::$$$message_0550_0011_0002$$$::When he exposed his chest, she was surprised by how masculine he was, covered muscles trained every day without rest, and not a gram of excess.[lr]::
60557::$$$message_0550_0011_0003$$$::If she had to compare his lithe body to that of an animal, he would be a wild goat. Small and beautiful, yet with the hidden strength to scale sheer cliffs.::
60558::$$$message_0550_0012_0000$$$::"Yeah...and his chest was so broad...so manly..."[lr]::
60559::$$$message_0550_0012_0001$$$::Her outstretched fingers trace the lines of a chest that isn't there.[lr]::
60560::$$$message_0550_0012_0002$$$::Unconsciously, they run up his body's lines like water drops.[lr]::
60561::$$$message_0550_0012_0003$$$::From his chest to his neck...[lr]::
60562::$$$message_0550_0012_0004$$$::Her fingers glide across the sheets, from his neck to his lips...[lr]::
60563::$$$message_0550_0012_0005$$$::"Ah."[lr]::
60564::$$$message_0550_0012_0006$$$::Her face goes bright red.::
60565::$$$message_0550_0013_0000$$$::"I-I'm so stupid!"[lr]::
60566::$$$message_0550_0013_0001$$$::In a panic, she tucks her arms in.[lr]::
60567::$$$message_0550_0013_0002$$$::The girl rolls into a ball on her bed, her ears turning just as red as her face.[lr]::
60568::$$$message_0550_0013_0003$$$::It shouldn't be this embarrassing, but the memory of his touch is just too fresh.[lr]::
60569::$$$message_0550_0013_0004$$$::The sensation of his skin on her fingertips just makes her imagination that much more vivid.::
60570::$$$message_0550_0014_0000$$$::"Senpai..."[lr]::
60571::$$$message_0550_0014_0001$$$::She clenches her hands tightly.[lr]::
60572::$$$message_0550_0014_0002$$$::She brings her face and hands in, trying to ball up the warmth heating her body.[lr]::
60573::$$$message_0550_0014_0003$$$::She can't think of anything else.[lr]::
60574::$$$message_0550_0014_0004$$$::She clutches her hands to her chest, clutching close the residual sensation in finger tips.[lr]::
60575::$$$message_0550_0014_0005$$$::"Senpai..."::
60576::$$$message_0550_0015_0000$$$::She endures the heat boiling up through her body.[lr]::
60577::$$$message_0550_0015_0001$$$::She won't be able to hold on if she lets it out.[lr]::
60578::$$$message_0550_0015_0002$$$::If that happens, she won't even be able to think of this one thing she's clinging to.::
60579::$$$message_0550_0016_0000$$$::"I'm...sorry..."[lr]::
60580::$$$message_0550_0016_0001$$$::   She's hounded by confusion and guilt towards the boy.[lr]::
60581::$$$message_0550_0016_0002$$$::His injured body. Just the thought of the bloody marks on his back makes her dizzy.[lr]::
60582::$$$message_0550_0016_0003$$$::   The girl who will never come home again. What she took from him. All the lies.[lr]::
60583::$$$message_0550_0016_0004$$$::Dark emotions she would normally never even entertain twist inside her, awakening a feeling of delight deep within...[r]::
60584::$$$message_0550_0017_0000$$$::"Senpai...I..."::
60585::$$$message_0550_0018_0000$$$::She calls out to him to try and bury the feelings.[lr]::
60586::$$$message_0550_0018_0001$$$::How long can she keep them down?[lr]::
60587::$$$message_0550_0018_0002$$$::She hugs her chest so tightly it contorts.[lr]::
60588::$$$message_0550_0018_0003$$$::Thoughts bubble up within her bosom.[lr]::
60589::$$$message_0550_0018_0004$$$::"Ha..."::
60590::$$$message_0550_0019_0000$$$::The only thing making her this happy, this relieved, is that the boy came home to her.::
60591::$$$message_0550_0020_0000$$$::"That's all I want, but Senpai, you..."::
60592::$$$message_0550_0021_0000$$$::...It isn't enough.[lr]::
60593::$$$message_0550_0021_0001$$$::She knows that now.[lr]::
60594::$$$message_0550_0021_0002$$$::He takes such good care of me, but he's trying to protect me by pushing me away.::
60595::$$$message_0550_0022_0000$$$::"No, we can't have that, Senpai. I want to be by your side..."::
60596::$$$message_0550_0023_0000$$$::She says her thoughts aloud.[lr]::
60597::$$$message_0550_0023_0001$$$::She knows how greedy she sounds.[lr]::
60598::$$$message_0550_0023_0002$$$::But because it's a desire that shouldn't be voiced, a wish that can't come true...::
60599::$$$message_0550_0024_0000$$$::"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Senpai."::
60600::$$$message_0550_0025_0000$$$::She moans her repentance.[lr]::
60601::$$$message_0550_0025_0001$$$::How vile she is, for delighting in his injuries.[lr]::
60602::$$$message_0550_0025_0002$$$::How decadent she is, for wanting to waste his efforts to protect her.[lr]::
60603::$$$message_0550_0025_0003$$$::It feels like a betrayal for someone like her to want to be with him.[lr]::
60604::$$$message_0550_0025_0004$$$::So she apologizes.[lr]::
60605::$$$message_0550_0025_0005$$$::The repentance and contrition quench her fever.::
60606::$$$message_0550_0026_0000$$$::"Ah...hah...ah..."[lr]::
60607::$$$message_0550_0026_0001$$$::She curls up in bed, damp with sweat.[lr]::
60608::$$$message_0550_0026_0002$$$::Her guilty conscience awakened a fever that was somehow like arousal.[lr]::
60609::$$$message_0550_0026_0003$$$::      Even though the fever has cooled, she feels troubled by a heavy agony.[lr]::
60610::$$$message_0550_0026_0004$$$::His wounded body...[lr]::
60611::$$$message_0550_0026_0005$$$::He's still going to fight, even after going through that.::
60612::$$$message_0550_0027_0000$$$::"What should I do, Senpai? You're going to get hurt even worse, now..."[lr]::
60613::$$$message_0550_0027_0001$$$::She frets, covered in sweat.[lr]::
60614::$$$message_0550_0027_0002$$$::It's a worry she doesn't have an answer for, and a problem she can't solve.[lr]::
60615::$$$message_0550_0027_0003$$$::She could think all night and still not come up with a way to stop the boy.[lr]::
60616::$$$message_0550_0027_0004$$$::Except...::
60617::$$$message_0550_0028_0000$$$::"Oh, I know. I can just stop him from going outside."[lr]::
60618::$$$message_0550_0028_0001$$$::With a relieved sigh, she arrives at an utterly simple answer.[lr]::
60619::$$$message_0550_0028_0002$$$::The girl breaks into a smile of someone who just had a divine revelation, feeling deep relief.[lr]::
60620::$$$message_0550_0028_0003$$$::Yeah. If I hurt you so you can't walk anymore, then you won't get into any danger, Senpai.[lr]::
60621::$$$message_0550_0028_0004$$$::She murmurs as if addressing someone.::ал
