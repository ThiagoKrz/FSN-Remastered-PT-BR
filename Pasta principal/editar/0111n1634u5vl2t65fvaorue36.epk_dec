15008::$$$message_0140_0000_0000$$$::"Argh!"[lr]::
15009::$$$message_0140_0000_0001$$$::I hear glass shattering.[lr]::
15010::$$$message_0140_0000_0002$$$::I hear the sound of intense fighting coming from the living room.[lr]::
15011::$$$message_0140_0000_0003$$$::"Shirou, your orders, please. There is no time to be indecisive."[lr]::
15012::$$$message_0140_0000_0004$$$::[font italic=true]I know.[font italic=false][lr]::
15013::$$$message_0140_0000_0005$$$::My delaying is making the situation worse.::
15014::$$$message_0140_0001_0000$$$::"We're going after Caster. I already said Tohsaka should take care of Illya."[lr]::
15015::$$$message_0140_0001_0001$$$::"Then let us go, Master. I will entrust my back to you."::
15016::$$$message_0140_0002_0000$$$::She hurries down the hall, mowing down bones as she goes.[lr]::
15017::$$$message_0140_0002_0001$$$::The bone soldiers disappear before getting anywhere near Saber.[lr]::
15018::$$$message_0140_0002_0002$$$::They are like vanishing snowflakes.[lr]::
15019::$$$message_0140_0002_0003$$$::Saber scatters so many in her path, it looks like a snowstorm.::
15020::$$$message_0140_0003_0000$$$::"...Hah..."[lr]::
15021::$$$message_0140_0003_0001$$$::She said she'd trust her back to me, but she pretty clearly doesn't need me to protect her.[lr]::
15022::$$$message_0140_0003_0002$$$::I'm once again reminded how skilled of a swordsman Saber is.::
15023::$$$message_0140_0004_0000$$$::Saber charges through them, unwavering.[lr]::
15024::$$$message_0140_0004_0001$$$::She cuts her way straight to the source of these bones.[lr]::
15025::$$$message_0140_0004_0002$$$::Her only goal now is to defeat the yet unseen sixth Servant that has invaded the house.::
15026::$$$message_0140_0005_0000$$$::Saber stops.[lr]::
15027::$$$message_0140_0005_0001$$$::The soldiers, which had been coming at us in droves, are suddenly gone.[lr]::
15028::$$$message_0140_0005_0002$$$::This must be our destination.[lr]::
15029::$$$message_0140_0005_0003$$$::A distorted human figure looms ahead of us.[lr]::
15030::$$$message_0140_0005_0004$$$::It wears a robe of some kind, but the robe itself is so dark that it looks more like a hole in the night.::
15031::$$$message_0140_0006_0000$$$::...A dark shadow.[lr]::
15032::$$$message_0140_0006_0001$$$::As soon as I lay eyes on the figure, I'm struck by an indescribable sense of anxiety.::
15033::$$$message_0140_0007_0000$$$::"Are you Saber? Ah yes, you certainly would be capable of defeating Berserker. My soldiers, then, would be no deterrent to you."::
15034::$$$message_0140_0008_0000$$$::The figure chuckles.[lr]::
15035::$$$message_0140_0008_0001$$$::It seems the dark figure is the master of those bone creatures...Caster.[lr]::
15036::$$$message_0140_0008_0002$$$::But...::
15037::$$$message_0140_0009_0000$$$::"There's no Master..."[lr]::
15038::$$$message_0140_0009_0001$$$::There's no sign of a Master nearby.[lr]::
15039::$$$message_0140_0009_0002$$$::Maybe she's the same as Lancer...able to move even far from her Master.::
15040::$$$message_0140_0010_0000$$$::"You... Has your contract been terminated?"[lr]::
15041::$$$message_0140_0010_0001$$$::Saber challenges her directly with the question.[lr]::
15042::$$$message_0140_0010_0002$$$::"Yes. That...man was unfit to be my Master. So I rid myself of him. He is no more."[lr]::
15043::$$$message_0140_0010_0003$$$::I can't see the expression on the robed Servant's face.[lr]::
15044::$$$message_0140_0010_0004$$$::But I can hear the terrible coldness in Caster's voice.::
15045::$$$message_0140_0011_0000$$$::"Master-killer...so your Master..."[lr]::
15046::$$$message_0140_0011_0001$$$::"He's long dead. But that is not a problem for me, Saber.[lr]::
15047::$$$message_0140_0011_0002$$$::We are soul-eaters. We are surrounded on all sides by sources of magical energy.[lr]::
15048::$$$message_0140_0011_0003$$$::All that remains is... Why, simply obtaining the Holy Grail. Then there is nothing else to worry about."::
15049::$$$message_0140_0012_0000$$$::"So you wish to live in this world, too? I do not know what Heroic Spirit you are, but have you abandoned what pride you had for this?"[lr]::
15050::$$$message_0140_0012_0001$$$::"Goodness. And would you not say letting yourself be used as a tool for humans is casting your pride aside?[lr]::
15051::$$$message_0140_0012_0002$$$::I could never endure that, both then and now. I grew tired of working for another's benefit. I prefer to be the one pulling the strings. You have no right to criticize."::
15052::$$$message_0140_0013_0000$$$::"I figured as much, but your misdeeds do not concern me."[lr]::
15053::$$$message_0140_0013_0001$$$::Saber tilts her body just slightly.[lr]::
15054::$$$message_0140_0013_0002$$$::   She's only about ten meters from Caster.[lr]::
15055::$$$message_0140_0013_0003$$$::Saber should be able to close that distance and bring Caster down in a heartbeat.::
15056::$$$message_0140_0014_0000$$$::"How nasty of you. I came here simply to talk, but you will not hear me? I will have you know, I've been gentle here."[lr]::
15057::$$$message_0140_0014_0001$$$::"There is nothing for us to discuss. You will die here."::
15058::$$$message_0140_0015_0000$$$::Saber is intent only on killing.[lr]::
15059::$$$message_0140_0015_0001$$$::...I'm not about to oppose her in this case.[lr]::
15060::$$$message_0140_0015_0002$$$::All I smell from Caster is blood.[lr]::
15061::$$$message_0140_0015_0003$$$::She must be telling the truth about murdering her Master.[lr]::
15062::$$$message_0140_0015_0004$$$::Her raid tonight was clearly intended to kill everyone in the house.::
15063::$$$message_0140_0016_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
15064::$$$message_0140_0016_0001$$$::So there's no reason for me to stop Saber.[lr]::
15065::$$$message_0140_0016_0002$$$::Besides, Caster isn't even a threat to Saber.[lr]::
15066::$$$message_0140_0016_0003$$$::Even I can see Caster's abilities.[lr]::
15067::$$$message_0140_0016_0004$$$::She is the weakest when it comes to one-to-one combat.[lr]::
15068::$$$message_0140_0016_0005$$$::If Saber engages her, she can only lose.::
15069::$$$message_0140_0017_0000$$$::"Don't do it, Saber..."[lr]::
15070::$$$message_0140_0017_0001$$$::Even with all of that in mind, I can't shake off this sense of anxiety.[lr]::
15071::$$$message_0140_0017_0002$$$::It's not the same feeling of hopeless, inevitable death I got whenever we were in Berserker's presence.[lr]::
15072::$$$message_0140_0017_0003$$$::Do I just have some sort of aversion to her, or is it a warning of something dangerous?[lr]::
15073::$$$message_0140_0017_0004$$$::Forget about me... Somehow, my left hand is aching to warn me that Saber should stay away from that thing.::
15074::$$$message_0140_0018_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
15075::$$$message_0140_0018_0001$$$::I hesitated too long.[lr]::
15076::$$$message_0140_0018_0002$$$::Saber launches herself at the dark shadow.::
15077::$$$message_0140_0019_0000$$$::Caster smiles.[lr]::
15078::$$$message_0140_0019_0001$$$::She doesn't look at all disturbed as Saber rushes toward her.[lr]::
15079::$$$message_0140_0019_0002$$$::"[atlas]."[lr]::
15080::$$$message_0140_0019_0003$$$::She mutters, "Atlas."[lr]::
15081::$$$message_0140_0019_0004$$$::I can't understand what she says, but it sends something beyond words straight into our minds.::
15082::$$$message_0140_0020_0000$$$::The world lurches and distorts.[lr]::
15083::$$$message_0140_0020_0001$$$::The air grows denser around Saber.[lr]::
15084::$$$message_0140_0020_0002$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
15085::$$$message_0140_0020_0003$$$::I hear...even feel a tremendous impact.[lr]::
15086::$$$message_0140_0020_0004$$$::The ground flexes like something massive slammed into Saber from above.::
15087::$$$message_0140_0021_0000$$$::"No way...she activated some kind of magecraft without moving a muscle!?"[lr]::
15088::$$$message_0140_0021_0001$$$::Actually, I think she murmured something like an incantation...[lr]::
15089::$$$message_0140_0021_0002$$$::Incantations can be shortened. The simpler the magecraft, the shorter the spell can be made.::
15090::$$$message_0140_0022_0000$$$::But this isn't by [font italic=true]any[font italic=false] means simple magecraft.[lr]::
15091::$$$message_0140_0022_0001$$$::Not many mages could visualize such a thing in a single breath.[lr]::
15092::$$$message_0140_0022_0002$$$::Even if it were possible, they'd need to prepare a catalyst ahead of time, like Tohsaka does.::
15093::$$$message_0140_0023_0000$$$::But Caster triggered the magecraft with a murmured word.[lr]::
15094::$$$message_0140_0023_0001$$$::I have never even heard of anything like this.[lr]::
15095::$$$message_0140_0023_0002$$$::If that is Caster's magecraft, she is no mere mage.::
15096::$$$message_0140_0024_0000$$$::"Saber!!!"[lr]::
15097::$$$message_0140_0024_0001$$$::Saber hovers there, frozen.[lr]::
15098::$$$message_0140_0024_0002$$$::Her feet still kick in midair.[lr]::
15099::$$$message_0140_0024_0003$$$::She hangs, suspended there.[lr]::
15100::$$$message_0140_0024_0004$$$::The air around her seems to have thickened into gelatin.::
15101::$$$message_0140_0025_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
15102::$$$message_0140_0025_0001$$$::I can't get close. Some sort of invisible barrier holds me back.[lr]::
15103::$$$message_0140_0025_0002$$$::The murkiness seems confined to Saber, but so long as her feet don't touch the ground, she can't move.::
15104::$$$message_0140_0026_0000$$$::"You underestimated me, Saber. I don't know how your mages fared in your life, but I lived during the Age of Gods.[lr]::
15105::$$$message_0140_0026_0001$$$::To these modern mages, what I do must seem like Magic."::
15106::$$$message_0140_0027_0000$$$::A ridiculing laugh echoes out from the depths of that dark robe.[lr]::
15107::$$$message_0140_0027_0001$$$::Saber is still suspended, helpless, in the air.::
15108::$$$message_0140_0028_0000$$$::"Oh? Is this really all you are capable of, Caster?"::
15109::$$$message_0140_0029_0000$$$::She dismisses this as if it were some dull trick.::
15110::$$$message_0140_0030_0000$$$::"Magic Resistance!? It repels even my magecraft!?"[lr]::
15111::$$$message_0140_0030_0001$$$::Caster steps back.[lr]::
15112::$$$message_0140_0030_0002$$$::After casually nullifying Caster's magecraft, Saber surges toward her at lightning speed.::
15113::$$$message_0140_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15114::$$$message_0140_0031_0001$$$::But I...[lr]6n½
