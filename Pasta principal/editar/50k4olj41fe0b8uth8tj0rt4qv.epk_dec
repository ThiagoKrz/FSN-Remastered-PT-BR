34036::$$$message_0275_0000_0001$$$::...I wake up.[lr]::
34037::$$$message_0275_0000_0002$$$::I feel heavy, like there's lead inside my head.::
34038::$$$message_0275_0001_0000$$$::"...What is this? I haven't been waking up well lately."[lr]::
34039::$$$message_0275_0001_0001$$$::I don't know if it's because there's a lot to think about, or if I'm having a weird dream.[lr]::
34040::$$$message_0275_0001_0002$$$::"Ungh..."[lr]::
34041::$$$message_0275_0001_0003$$$::Even though I usually don't dream, I feel like I've been experiencing something like a dream recently.::
34042::$$$message_0275_0002_0000$$$::"...Well, they were beautiful swords..."[lr]::
34043::$$$message_0275_0002_0001$$$::I often vaguely dream of swords.[lr]::
34044::$$$message_0275_0002_0002$$$::Among them, his blades appear frequently.::
34045::$$$message_0275_0003_0000$$$::"...Ugh. Yeah, I like them. So what?"[lr]::
34046::$$$message_0275_0003_0001$$$::I curse at Archer, who's not even here, and get out of bed.[lr]::
34047::$$$message_0275_0003_0002$$$::It's before 6 AM.[lr]::
34048::$$$message_0275_0003_0003$$$::I can't be getting distracted by strange dreams. I should go prepare breakfast.::
34049::$$$message_0275_0004_0000$$$::Saber sees me off as I leave the house.[lr]::
34050::$$$message_0275_0004_0001$$$::I've gotten used to this lifestyle, and the morning passes by smoothly without anything particular happening.::
34051::$$$message_0275_0005_0000$$$::I don't see Tohsaka by the school gate.[lr]::
34052::$$$message_0275_0005_0001$$$::Since the only lead we had, Issei, ended up innocent, I bet she's busy running around gathering information.::
34053::$$$message_0275_0006_0000$$$::"...Yeah, but this is my problem too. I need to do some investigating as well."[lr]::
34054::$$$message_0275_0006_0001$$$::...But the question is how to do that.[lr]::
34055::$$$message_0275_0006_0002$$$::Tohsaka's probably investigating the people at school, so I should investigate the building one more time.::
34056::$$$message_0275_0007_0000$$$::   Well, it's not like we'll be able to conveniently find out what we didn't know before.[lr]::
34057::$$$message_0275_0007_0001$$$::I used the break and the first half of lunch to look around school, but I couldn't find any abnormalities.::
34058::$$$message_0275_0008_0000$$$::"Hm. I don't know what you were doing, but good work."[lr]::
34059::$$$message_0275_0008_0001$$$::He must've finished lunch already, as Issei acknowledges my efforts while reading an old poetry anthology.::
34060::$$$message_0275_0009_0000$$$::"...Thanks. I'll be having tea since I'm going to eat lunch. Wait, where's the teapot?"[lr]::
34061::$$$message_0275_0009_0001$$$::"Oh, it's here. But, we only have kelp tea. Is that all right?"::
34062::$$$message_0275_0010_0000$$$::"Huh? Hmm, then I'll just have plain hot water. I just can't handle how thick kelp tea is." [lr]::
34063::$$$message_0275_0010_0001$$$::"I see, I see. Then I'll get green tea from the teacher's office tomorrow."[lr]::
34064::$$$message_0275_0010_0002$$$::I leave a rather cheerful Issei to himself and pour myself water before I sit at the table.::
34065::$$$message_0275_0011_0000$$$::"Guess I'll dig in."[lr]::
34066::$$$message_0275_0011_0001$$$::I clap my hands together and open my lunch.[lr]::
34067::$$$message_0275_0011_0002$$$::At the same time, someone knocks on the door.[lr]::
34068::$$$message_0275_0011_0003$$$::"Oh? There's someone at the door, Issei."[lr]::
34069::$$$message_0275_0011_0004$$$::"Hm? At this time?"[lr]::
34070::$$$message_0275_0011_0005$$$::Issei slowly goes to the door.::
34071::$$$message_0275_0012_0000$$$::The visitor is Mr. Kuzuki, the teacher in charge of the student council.[lr]::
34072::$$$message_0275_0012_0001$$$::I run into him often, and I bet he thinks I let myself into the student council room overly frequently.::
34073::$$$message_0275_0013_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34074::$$$message_0275_0013_0001$$$::I quietly eat my ground chicken lunch.[lr]::
34075::$$$message_0275_0013_0002$$$::He must have nothing to report today, as Issei and Mr. Kuzuki are just chatting.::
34076::$$$message_0275_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34077::$$$message_0275_0014_0001$$$::I munch on my food.[lr]::
34078::$$$message_0275_0014_0002$$$::I work on finishing up.::
34079::$$$message_0275_0015_0000$$$::"Mr. Kuzuki, it's almost time."[lr]::
34080::$$$message_0275_0015_0001$$$::"Mm, I see. Sorry to take up your time. I'm sure you know without being told, but don't forget to lock up. And make sure you leave school on time."[lr]::
34081::$$$message_0275_0015_0002$$$::"Yes, yes. I know."[lr]::
34082::$$$message_0275_0015_0003$$$::Mr. Kuzuki leaves, and Issei comes back in a rather good mood.::
34083::$$$message_0275_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34084::$$$message_0275_0016_0001$$$::...Wow, that was a rarity.[lr]::
34085::$$$message_0275_0016_0002$$$::Souichirou Kuzuki chatting with a student.[lr]::
34086::$$$message_0275_0016_0003$$$::And with a normally rather shy Issei.[lr]::
34087::$$$message_0275_0016_0004$$$::...Well, they might get along because they're both stubborn, but it's still odd. ::
34088::$$$message_0275_0017_0000$$$::"Hey, Issei."[lr]::
34089::$$$message_0275_0017_0001$$$::"Hm? What, Emiya?"[lr]::
34090::$$$message_0275_0017_0002$$$::"You know, I've been wondering for a while, but are you close with Mr. Kuzuki?"[lr]::
34091::$$$message_0275_0017_0003$$$::Oh, he's surprised.::
34092::$$$message_0275_0018_0000$$$::"...No, it's fine if it's private. I just thought that was the case, so don't worry about it."[lr]::
34093::$$$message_0275_0018_0001$$$::"Oh, no, that's not it. I just realized I hadn't told you. It's only natural that we're close. Mr. Kuzuki is like a big brother to me."[lr]::
34094::$$$message_0275_0018_0002$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
34095::$$$message_0275_0018_0003$$$::Mr. Kuzuki is like...Issei's...big brother...?::
34096::$$$message_0275_0019_0000$$$::"Hold on. What do you mean?"[lr]::
34097::$$$message_0275_0019_0001$$$::"I said he's like my big brother.[lr]::
34098::$$$message_0275_0019_0002$$$::Souichirou... Mr. Kuzuki has been staying at our place for the past three years or so. As you can see, he's rather plain and sincere. Living under the same roof as him, I've come to respect him. It's natural that I would look up to him as an older brother."::
34099::$$$message_0275_0020_0000$$$::"...Kuzuki lives at Ryudou Temple...?"[lr]::
34100::$$$message_0275_0020_0001$$$::I feel like the back of my head has been hit.[lr]::
34101::$$$message_0275_0020_0002$$$::But I force myself to stay calm on the outside and ask Issei to continue.::
34102::$$$message_0275_0021_0000$$$::"Oh yeah. You said there's a woman lately, right? Does Kuzuki know about her?"[lr]::
34103::$$$message_0275_0021_0001$$$::"He doesn't just know her. She's his fiancée. We're letting her borrow a room until they hold their wedding."::
34104::$$$message_0275_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34105::$$$message_0275_0022_0001$$$::A second shock.[lr]::
34106::$$$message_0275_0022_0002$$$::"Issei. I don't think...you would just call her some new woman in that case..."[lr]::
34107::$$$message_0275_0022_0003$$$::I try my best to object through dizziness.::
34108::$$$message_0275_0023_0000$$$::"Well, she is certainly new and we're not well-acquainted. Even if she's Mr. Kuzuki's fiancée, that's all I can say about her if I don't even know her name."[lr]::
34109::$$$message_0275_0023_0001$$$::Issei ends the conversation, clearly uncomfortable.::
34110::$$$message_0275_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34111::$$$message_0275_0024_0001$$$::...A-anyways...[lr]::
34112::$$$message_0275_0024_0002$$$::Regardless of the source, this is news I can't ignore.[lr]::
34113::$$$message_0275_0024_0003$$$::Souichirou Kuzuki commutes from Ryudou Temple, and a woman who is staying at Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
34114::$$$message_0275_0024_0004$$$::I heard that Mr. Kuzuki's fiancée showed up about a month ago.[lr]::
34115::$$$message_0275_0024_0005$$$::If that was Caster, then we pretty much have our answer...::
34116::$$$message_0275_0025_0000$$$::"So, that's what I heard."[lr]::
34117::$$$message_0275_0025_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34118::$$$message_0275_0025_0002$$$::In class after school.[lr]::
34119::$$$message_0275_0025_0003$$$::There's only ten minutes until we have to go home, but I tell Tohsaka about Mr. Kuzuki.::
34120::$$$message_0275_0026_0000$$$::"What do you think? Considering Issei's situation as well, I don't think we should suspect him just because he lives at the temple."::
34121::$$$message_0275_0027_0000$$$::"...Mr. Kuzuki, huh? ...He doesn't have the presence of a Master, since he's not even a mage to start with."[lr]::
34122::$$$message_0275_0027_0001$$$::I don't know if she's even listening to me, as she frowns like she's not convinced.::
34123::$$$message_0275_0028_0000$$$::"Not a mage...? Oh, that's good. So we can count Kuzuki out then."[lr]::
34124::$$$message_0275_0028_0001$$$::"Why? Someone that suspicious has to be a Master."[lr]::
34125::$$$message_0275_0028_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34126::$$$message_0275_0028_0003$$$::...Okay, I guess I'm starting to get used to this.[lr]::
34127::$$$message_0275_0028_0004$$$::But I still can't keep up with Tohsaka's thought process.::
34128::$$$message_0275_0029_0000$$$::"We'll ambush him tonight. I'll try pulling some strings so he'll have to stay the night shift, so you be ready too."::
34129::$$$message_0275_0030_0000$$$::"Toh[line2]Hold on. We can't do that.[lr]::
34130::$$$message_0275_0030_0001$$$::Getting him on the night shift... Are you saying we'll fight him tonight?"[lr]::
34131::$$$message_0275_0030_0002$$$::"Of course. There's no guarantee that Kuzuki will come to school tomorrow.[lr]::
34132::$$$message_0275_0030_0003$$$::We can't afford to wait. We'll make him stay at school until night and test him on his way home to see if he's a Master or not."::
34133::$$$message_0275_0031_0000$$$::"...Let me ask just in case. How are we going to test if he's a Master or not?"[lr]::
34134::$$$message_0275_0031_0001$$$::"Using force. Just like I did to you."::
34135::$$$message_0275_0032_0000$$$::The way she says that sounds oddly honeyed.[lr]::
34136::$$$message_0275_0032_0001$$$::...She really does like pushing people around.[lr]::
34137::$$$message_0275_0032_0002$$$::Maybe in another lifetime the two of us fought over a playground's peace as children.::
34138::$$$message_0275_0033_0000$$$::"...I'm against it. There's got to be a less violent way to check. There's no need to take such dangerous measures."[lr]::
34139::$$$message_0275_0033_0001$$$::"It's not dangerous. I'm not indiscriminate, you know?[lr]::
34140::$$$message_0275_0033_0002$$$::I'm just going to shoot a light Gandr at him from the shadows. Even if he's an ordinary citizen, he'll only be bedridden with a cold for a couple days."::
34141::$$$message_0275_0034_0000$$$::"Oh... Well, that's a problem too. If Mr. Kuzuki is really a Master, then we'll get into battle right then and there. As long as we attack first, we won't be able to talk to him."::
34142::$$$message_0275_0035_0000$$$::"Mm? You don't get it. That's even more favorable for us.[lr]::
34143::$$$message_0275_0035_0001$$$::What part of it are you calling dangerous, Emiya?"::
34144::$$$message_0275_0036_0000$$$::"You also don't get it! I'm saying that's dangerous for you."[lr]::
34145::$$$message_0275_0036_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34146::$$$message_0275_0036_0002$$$::Tohsaka must have finally realized, as she pauses.::
34147::$$$message_0275_0037_0000$$$::But only for an instant.[lr]::
34148::$$$message_0275_0037_0001$$$::"I see. That's fine, I'll just do it by myself then."[lr]::
34149::$$$message_0275_0037_0002$$$::She decides just like that.::
34150::$$$message_0275_0038_0000$$$::"Ugh...!"[lr]::
34151::$$$message_0275_0038_0001$$$::Damn it, I guess there's no use saying anything to Tohsaka once she's made up her mind.::
34152::$$$message_0275_0039_0000$$$::"...Fine, I'll go with you. I don't know what kind of crazy things you would do if I let you be."[lr]::
34153::$$$message_0275_0039_0001$$$::"That's my line... God, I was wondering what you were going to say."::
34154::$$$message_0275_0040_0000$$$::"...It's time to go home. Let's meet at 7 PM at the park under the bridge. It'll most likely turn into a battle, so you better be prepared."[lr]::
34155::$$$message_0275_0040_0001$$$::She looks away and starts walking.[lr]::
34156::$$$message_0275_0040_0002$$$::I leave the classroom after her.::
34157::$$$message_0275_0041_0000$$$::"So we will ambush Caster's Master tonight?"[lr]::
34158::$$$message_0275_0041_0001$$$::"Well, we don't know for sure yet if Kuzuki is the Master, but that's pretty much the plan."::
34159::$$$message_0275_0042_0000$$$::I give Saber a detailed account of today's events as soon as I get home.[lr]::
34160::$$$message_0275_0042_0001$$$::Saber agrees with Tohsaka and already seems roused by the prospect.::
34161::$$$message_0275_0043_0000$$$::"So we won't be training today. I'll prepare dinner right away, so let's get ready for tonight... Wait, is it bad to eat before going to battle?"::
34162::$$$message_0275_0044_0000$$$::"Hmm...? Why are you asking such a thing? I believe there will be a problem if we are on an empty stomach during battle..."[lr]::
34163::$$$message_0275_0044_0001$$$::"Well, I thought it might be too heavy on the stomach. We don't even have an hour left, so it might be better to eat dinner once we come back home."::
34164::$$$message_0275_0045_0000$$$::"Oh, no, I do not think that is the case. It is also the quality of a warrior to be able to quickly digest anything we consume.[lr]::
34165::$$$message_0275_0045_0001$$$::Um, well, I do not think meals are much of a problem if one has been training and has led a proper lifestyle..."::
34166::$$$message_0275_0046_0000$$$::"So...does that mean I can cook dinner?"[lr]::
34167::$$$message_0275_0046_0001$$$::"Yes. I believe we will have more energy that way."[lr]::
34168::$$$message_0275_0046_0002$$$::...I see.[lr]::
34169::$$$message_0275_0046_0003$$$::Well, I've also trained so that I can move right after I eat, so I guess there's no problem.[lr]::
34170::$$$message_0275_0046_0004$$$::But well, I'll still make something light just in case.::
34171::$$$message_0275_0047_0000$$$::"Then I'll be in the living room, but what about you, Saber?"[lr]::
34172::$$$message_0275_0047_0001$$$::"I shouldn't bother you. I shall stay and clear my mind for now."[lr]::
34173::$$$message_0275_0047_0002$$$::I guess she means to meditate.::
34174::$$$message_0275_0048_0000$$$::"Got it. I'll come get you once dinner's ready."[lr]::
34175::$$$message_0275_0048_0001$$$::I leave the dojo.[lr]::
34176::$$$message_0275_0048_0002$$$::It's completely dark outside.[lr]::
34177::$$$message_0275_0048_0003$$$::We're meeting at 7 PM... So that means that we will ambush Mr. Kuzuki an hour after that.::
34178::$$$message_0275_0049_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34179::$$$message_0275_0049_0001$$$::If Mr. Kuzuki is a Master, then we'll have to fight.[lr]::
34180::$$$message_0275_0049_0002$$$::Caster is a cautious Servant.[lr]::
34181::$$$message_0275_0049_0003$$$::If she found out that her Master was attacked, we won't get another chance.[lr]::
34182::$$$message_0275_0049_0004$$$::...Then we have to make sure that it's fatal if we're going to attack.[lr]::
34183::$$$message_0275_0049_0005$$$::We can't let the opponent escape and don't have the luxury of fleeing ourselves.::
34184::$$$message_0275_0050_0000$$$::No matter the opponent... In order to stop Caster from attacking all the people in the town, we must defeat her Master.[lr]::
34185::$$$message_0275_0050_0001$$$::If all goes well, we'll take away his Command Spells and he won't be a Master anymore.[lr]::
34186::$$$message_0275_0050_0002$$$::...But if worst comes to worst and we're unable to manage that, it will probably turn into a fight to the death.::
34187::$$$message_0275_0051_0000$$$::"...Oh yeah. I have to take a weapon."[lr]::
34188::$$$message_0275_0051_0001$$$::A weapon from here... The easiest thing to pass energy through is probably a wooden sword.[lr]::
34189::$$$message_0275_0051_0002$$$:: My success rate at Strengthening has been going up recently, so even a wooden sword would become a good weapon.[lr]::
34190::$$$message_0275_0051_0003$$$::But that is only the case for a normal fight.[lr]::
34191::$$$message_0275_0051_0004$$$::I'll need a better weapon to fight against a Servant or Master.::
34192::$$$message_0275_0052_0000$$$::"If I were being greedy...swords like his."[lr]::
34193::$$$message_0275_0052_0001$$$::...I imagine what I saw in my dream.::
34194::$$$message_0275_0053_0000$$$::The black and white twin swords.[lr]::
34195::$$$message_0275_0053_0001$$$::They're a length that even I'd feel comfortable using.[lr]::
34196::$$$message_0275_0053_0002$$$::And ultimately...I would be able to fight decently enough with them.[lr]::
34197::$$$message_0275_0053_0003$$$::I could protect myself without being a burden to Saber and be able to proudly say that I'm her Master.::
34198::$$$message_0275_0054_0000$$$::"...Man. There's no use in wishing for something I don't have, idiot."::
34199::$$$message_0275_0055_0000$$$::I sigh and head to the porch.[lr]::
34200::$$$message_0275_0055_0001$$$::I'll just do what I can do.[lr]::
34201::$$$message_0275_0055_0002$$$::For now, I'll put my energy and strength into making dinner.[lr]::
34202::$$$message_0275_0055_0003$$$::Saber is so serious, but it seems like she looks forward to meals. It has secretly been my joy to make her happy with them.::
