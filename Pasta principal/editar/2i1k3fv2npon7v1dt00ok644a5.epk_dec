51008::$$$message_0439_0000_0000$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
51009::$$$message_0439_0000_0001$$$::It would probably cause some trouble if I were to take Saber to walk around school.[lr]::
51010::$$$message_0439_0000_0002$$$::I should stay in this familiar room and chill until the evening.::
51011::$$$message_0439_0001_0000$$$::"Yeah. I'll stay and watch if it's not going to be a bother, Fuji-nee."[lr]::
51012::$$$message_0439_0001_0001$$$::"Alrighty. I'll go coach then, so you can just space out here. Oh, if you feel like shooting, go right on ahead. You're my student, and you're better than most people.::
51013::$$$message_0439_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51014::$$$message_0439_0002_0001$$$::I suppose. I am better than the others on the shooting front.::
51015::$$$message_0439_0003_0000$$$::Even though I've been away from it, I'm sure I can get the same results as when I was active.[lr]::
51016::$$$message_0439_0003_0001$$$::But, that's not because of archery skills.[lr]::
51017::$$$message_0439_0003_0002$$$::I can hit the target like I do mentally while I'm working on magecraft.::
51018::$$$message_0439_0004_0000$$$::"That's not true, Fuji-nee. I'm no good with the 'persistence' part of the sport."::
51019::$$$message_0439_0005_0000$$$::"What? The 'shoot 200 arrows a day and the rest is just releasing the bow' thing? You focus on some of the boring parts, Shirou."::
51020::$$$message_0439_0006_0000$$$::"Hey, anyone who does kyudo should know this.[lr]::
51021::$$$message_0439_0006_0001$$$::Anyway, I'm not gonna shoot half-heartedly. I'm not in the swing of it anymore, so I don't know if I'll even hit the target."::
51022::$$$message_0439_0007_0000$$$::"...Oh. But Shirou, shooting arrows everyday isn't the only way to train.[lr]::
51023::$$$message_0439_0007_0001$$$::Even if you're not shooting, if you're training yourself, that's enough for the persistence part. It's good to draw a clear line, but having respect towards the sport covers commitment. Anyway, don't sweat the small stuff and just go with the flow, my guy."::
51024::$$$message_0439_0008_0000$$$::Fuji-nee heads to the range.[lr]::
51025::$$$message_0439_0008_0001$$$::As if tagging in, Mitsuzuri enters.::
51026::$$$message_0439_0009_0000$$$::"'Scuse me... Oh, why the long face, Emiya?[lr]::
51027::$$$message_0439_0009_0001$$$::Got the whole spiel from Ms. Fujimura, eh?"[lr]::
51028::$$$message_0439_0009_0002$$$::"I guess. She told me not to worry so much. Though she is probably right."::
51029::$$$message_0439_0010_0000$$$::"Oh, I see. I totally thought you lost interest. I didn't realize you still had the itch. That's a bit unexpected."::
51030::$$$message_0439_0011_0000$$$::"It's unexpected? What, did it look like I got bored with kyudo to you?"::
51031::$$$message_0439_0012_0000$$$::"Yes. I mean, you only missed the target once. From day one when I joined, all I thought was that you had crazy skills. Your form was beautiful, and you seemed like you didn't know how to miss.[lr]::
51032::$$$message_0439_0012_0001$$$::And then I thought, man, you must not even be happy anymore when you're this good. Even without a bow, you can get into the headspace, and it's annoying that it looked like the bow was even maybe in the way."::
51033::$$$message_0439_0013_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51034::$$$message_0439_0013_0001$$$::"Was I right? I bet. Kyudo is to shoot one's mind. The arrow isn't shot at the target, but at the mind of the shooter.[lr]::
51035::$$$message_0439_0013_0002$$$::Those who can't face themselves, or those who can't shoot oneself, won't understand the mental space they need to find."::
51036::$$$message_0439_0014_0000$$$::In other words, kyudo is a way to kill oneself.[lr]::
51037::$$$message_0439_0014_0001$$$::To make yourself transparent and aim to be one with nature.[lr]::
51038::$$$message_0439_0014_0002$$$::The eight stages of shooting are for that... Ashibumi, the footing. Dozukuri, correct posture. Yugamae, readying the bow. Uchiokoshi, the action of raising the bow. Hikiwake, drawing the bow. Kai, the full draw. Hanare, the release. And zanshin, the follow-through of the shot.::
51039::$$$message_0439_0015_0000$$$::Specifically with kai, the unity of the target and oneself.[lr]::
51040::$$$message_0439_0015_0001$$$::With the release of the arrow that has become oneself, that snapshot in time is called hanare.[lr]::
51041::$$$message_0439_0015_0002$$$::The self that becomes further away with a hit, as well as the action and result becoming one, it all converges to make the past and future into a singular point. That is zanshin.::
51042::$$$message_0439_0016_0000$$$::It's a ritual. Practice to build oneself. [lr]::
51043::$$$message_0439_0016_0001$$$::That's right.[lr]::
51044::$$$message_0439_0016_0002$$$::Basically, kyudo's process resembles meditation in magecraft.::
51045::$$$message_0439_0017_0000$$$::"I suppose I'm preaching to the choir here. Hitting the target is a bonus. Kyudo is mental framework. It's a path rather than skills.[lr]::
51046::$$$message_0439_0017_0001$$$::Put another way, kyudo is a sport where you cannot reach that state of mind if you don't have a bow."::
51047::$$$message_0439_0018_0000$$$::"...I thought that was the boring part for you. The rest of us shoot an arrow and when it hits the target, we get the illusion of feeling it. Even though we know that shooting is only a means to do so, we don't know if we were able to purify ourselves until the arrow hits the target."::
51048::$$$message_0439_0019_0000$$$::"But Emiya, you're the type that doesn't care where the arrow goes.[lr]::
51049::$$$message_0439_0019_0001$$$::...Anyone can hit the target in kyudo. If you disregard the eight stages and just focus on the technique of hitting the target, anyone can do it.[lr]::
51050::$$$message_0439_0019_0002$$$::But that's only making an arrow hit the target with their skills. Real shooters hit the target, no matter how bad skill-wise the shooter may be."::
51051::$$$message_0439_0020_0000$$$::"...That's not true, though. I go to the range so that I can hit the target, too."::
51052::$$$message_0439_0021_0000$$$::"That's what I'm talking about. Do you actually need to come all the way to the range to practice? Even the bow part seems to be irrelevant in the first place for you.[lr]::
51053::$$$message_0439_0021_0001$$$::You've missed the target once, right? I wanted to see if you'd flip out, but it was still nothing to you."::
51054::$$$message_0439_0022_0000$$$::"When I asked why, you said, 'I deliberately pictured a miss.'[lr]::
51055::$$$message_0439_0022_0001$$$::You didn't miss because you screwed up, you missed because you wanted to.[lr]::
51056::$$$message_0439_0022_0002$$$::That's when I realized you [font italic=true]always[font italic=false] picture hitting the target before you even fire. Everything else is still just follow-through." ::
51057::$$$message_0439_0023_0000$$$::"Hm...? What are you talking about? That's just basics, right? Don't you also imagine the arrow hitting the target and follow accordingly?"::
51058::$$$message_0439_0024_0000$$$::"Of course. People try all sorts of things and hope for the best. But that's only in our imagination. We can't envision it like you can, Emiya."[lr]::
51059::$$$message_0439_0024_0001$$$::You're already 'one with nature' and all. You've reached the state of nothingness, to put it in martial arts terms."::
51060::$$$message_0439_0025_0000$$$::...Hm.[lr]::
51061::$$$message_0439_0025_0001$$$::I don't know if I can actually envision it like that, but I can agree to the nothingness part.[lr]::
51062::$$$message_0439_0025_0002$$$::Being able to erase oneself to make a circuit is the sign of a strong mage.[lr]::
51063::$$$message_0439_0025_0003$$$::To make the self transparent and rid oneself of any attachments and desires to reach a goal, simply chasing after the result.[lr]::
51064::$$$message_0439_0025_0004$$$::When it comes to making oneself into nothingness, the training for kyudo and magecraft are similar.::
51065::$$$message_0439_0026_0000$$$::"This is getting complicated... What are you getting at, Mitsuzuri?"::
51066::$$$message_0439_0027_0000$$$::"What I'm saying is since you're unselfish, that transparency is easy for you. You should be more greedy and selfish. It's boring if you become a master at such a young age, you know? I won't tell you to be like Shinji, but why don't you have some fun once in a while?"::
51067::$$$message_0439_0028_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51068::$$$message_0439_0028_0001$$$::I'm at a loss for words.[lr]::
51069::$$$message_0439_0028_0002$$$::On one hand, I don't really see it, but on the other, I can't think of anything that I consider fun.::
51070::$$$message_0439_0029_0000$$$::"I told you. That's why Sakura has such a hard time with you. If you don't know how to let loose now, you won't know how to once you get older.[lr]::
51071::$$$message_0439_0029_0001$$$::That's what society calls good-for-nothings."[lr]::
51072::$$$message_0439_0029_0002$$$::She gives me a pointed "do you understand?" sort of look, sort of surprising from her.::
51073::$$$message_0439_0030_0000$$$::"...Man, am I really that helpless that you're concerned about my future? Why are you so worried about me?"[lr]::
51074::$$$message_0439_0030_0001$$$::"Because you don't laugh, Emiya."[lr]::
51075::$$$message_0439_0030_0002$$$::"Huh...?"::
51076::$$$message_0439_0031_0000$$$::"I'm talking about training camp. Everyone had a blast, but you never really let yourself truly laugh even at my best jokes."[lr]::
51077::$$$message_0439_0031_0001$$$::"...Hm. So, that means..."::
51078::$$$message_0439_0032_0000$$$::"Yeah. I'm still mad about that, and I keep receipts."[lr]::
51079::$$$message_0439_0032_0001$$$::Mitsuzuri says this...[lr]::
51080::$$$message_0439_0032_0002$$$::smiling in challenge at me, her chosen opponent.::
