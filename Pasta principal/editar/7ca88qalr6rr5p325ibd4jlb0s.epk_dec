59770::$$$message_0544_0000_0000$$$::And so, Rin Tohsaka arrives at her destination.[lr]::
59771::$$$message_0544_0000_0001$$$::The Matou residence.[lr]::
59772::$$$message_0544_0000_0002$$$::It's the atelier of an old mage lineage that immigrated to this town two hundred years ago.[lr]::
59773::$$$message_0544_0000_0003$$$::Her family welcomed them as collaborators and gave them land, and yet these fellows are outsiders whom they have never been friends with.[lr]::
59774::$$$message_0544_0000_0004$$$::The Tohsakas and Matous practice mutual non-aggression, and have a pact that prevents them from easily involving themselves with each other.::
59775::$$$message_0544_0001_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
59776::$$$message_0544_0001_0001$$$::She really could not care less.[lr]::
59777::$$$message_0544_0001_0002$$$::That pact was broken eleven years ago.[lr]::
59778::$$$message_0544_0001_0003$$$::And the people who made that deal were the family heads from centuries ago.[lr]::
59779::$$$message_0544_0001_0004$$$::For two hundred years, they've followed an agreement whose reasons and content are unclear.::
59780::$$$message_0544_0002_0000$$$::And for all that time, neither the Tohsakas or Matous have obtained their goal, the Holy Grail.[lr]::
59781::$$$message_0544_0002_0001$$$::Originally, the pact was only about getting the Holy Grail.[lr]::
59782::$$$message_0544_0002_0002$$$::That's never happened, so she has no reason to follow that musty old rule.::
59783::$$$message_0544_0003_0000$$$::Rin passes through the front door without ringing the doorbell.[lr]::
59784::$$$message_0544_0003_0001$$$::She's never been here as a guest.[lr]::
59785::$$$message_0544_0003_0002$$$::She's only here as a Master to eliminate her enemies in the Holy Grail War.::
59786::$$$message_0544_0004_0000$$$::"Yeah, but..."[lr]::
59787::$$$message_0544_0004_0001$$$::Rin searches the manor, looking like she's chewing something bitter.[lr]::
59788::$$$message_0544_0004_0002$$$::...She's here for the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
59789::$$$message_0544_0004_0003$$$::So there's no need for her to follow the Tohsaka-Matou pact.[lr]::
59790::$$$message_0544_0004_0004$$$::   That's what she tells herself, but she can't change who she is.::
59791::$$$message_0544_0005_0000$$$::"...Oh. This is the first time I've gone against Father's instructions."[lr]::
59792::$$$message_0544_0005_0001$$$::She murmurs absently.[lr]::
59793::$$$message_0544_0005_0002$$$::It isn't particularly remarkable.[lr]::
59794::$$$message_0544_0005_0003$$$::She might have gone against her father's teachings, but she hasn't broken anything important.::
59795::$$$message_0544_0006_0000$$$::Her only regret is...[lr]::
59796::$$$message_0544_0006_0001$$$::"...I'm such a moron. If I was going to break the rules anyway, then I should've done this way sooner."[lr]::
59797::$$$message_0544_0006_0002$$$::...the guilt she's been bearing towards a certain someone for the last ten years.::
59798::$$$message_0544_0007_0000$$$::"Rin. There are two blank areas in the floor plan."[lr]::
59799::$$$message_0544_0007_0001$$$::"Huh? Where, the first floor?"[lr]::
59800::$$$message_0544_0007_0002$$$::"It starts on the second floor. The stairs are narrow, but they probably lead underground."[lr]::
59801::$$$message_0544_0007_0003$$$::"...Okay. By the way, Archer, have you noticed?"[lr]::
59802::$$$message_0544_0007_0004$$$::"Of course. But it's no threat to us. I won't concern myself with it if you don't. Our objective is that fiend, Zouken."[lr]::
59803::$$$message_0544_0007_0005$$$::She nods at the voice next to her and heads for the hidden passage on the second floor.::
59804::$$$message_0544_0008_0000$$$::   Rin can't see him, but the red knight is at her side.[lr]::
59805::$$$message_0544_0008_0001$$$::She brought him along in case of a fight, but her Servant appears to be the meticulous sort.[lr]::
59806::$$$message_0544_0008_0002$$$::He sketched out a mental floor plan after walking around the house just once and pointed out rooms that seemed to be missing.[lr]::
59807::$$$message_0544_0008_0003$$$::Rin had a vague sense of it already, but Archer has the ability to grasp the design and structure of objects. It's a specialized ability one would never expect from a knight.::
59808::$$$message_0544_0009_0000$$$::"...I've been thinking this for a while, but it's really weird how good you are at that, even though you're an Archer."[lr]::
59809::$$$message_0544_0009_0001$$$::"Save the sass for later. It's open. Be careful, it's dark inside."[lr]::
59810::$$$message_0544_0009_0002$$$::The conversation stops.[lr]::
59811::$$$message_0544_0009_0003$$$::The wall opens.[lr]::
59812::$$$message_0544_0009_0004$$$::Damp air wafts out from the passage leading underground.[lr]::
59813::$$$message_0544_0009_0005$$$::It's an unbearable, rotten odor that Archer can feel even without his material body.::
59814::$$$message_0544_0010_0000$$$::Rin walks down the wet stone steps.[lr]::
59815::$$$message_0544_0010_0001$$$::Her surroundings are greenish dark.[lr]::
59816::$$$message_0544_0010_0002$$$::The countless holes in the walls must be to entomb the dead.[lr]::
59817::$$$message_0544_0010_0003$$$::The bodies in the stone coffins decompose and erode, leaving empty holes for their next occupants.[lr]::
59818::$$$message_0544_0010_0004$$$::Not so different from aboveground burials, except for one thing: [lr]::
59819::$$$message_0544_0010_0005$$$::the way those bodies decompose.[lr]::
59820::$$$message_0544_0010_0006$$$::Here, it isn't the dirt that breaks the corpses down, but countless squirming insects.::
59821::$$$message_0544_0011_0000$$$::"So this is the Matous[line2]the Makiris' training room."[lr]::
59822::$$$message_0544_0011_0001$$$::She murmurs, feeling dizzy.[lr]::
59823::$$$message_0544_0011_0002$$$::It isn't because of any feeling of repugnance, nor a chill.[lr]::
59824::$$$message_0544_0011_0003$$$::Anger is what makes her tremble, regret, and vomit.[lr]::
59825::$$$message_0544_0011_0004$$$::This is a training room.[lr]::
59826::$$$message_0544_0011_0005$$$::This place is a training room.[lr]::
59827::$$$message_0544_0011_0006$$$::This rotten, wet room, filled with nothing but death and countless insects, is what the Matous give their successor.::
59828::$$$message_0544_0012_0000$$$::"...Ngh!"[lr]::
59829::$$$message_0544_0012_0001$$$::What...what does one even learn here?[lr]::
59830::$$$message_0544_0012_0002$$$::This chamber is only for breeding.[lr]::
59831::$$$message_0544_0012_0003$$$::For feeding, multiplying, and training insects.[lr]::
59832::$$$message_0544_0012_0004$$$::Then, the Matous must also use insects to educate, discipline, and raise their successors...::
59833::$$$message_0544_0013_0000$$$::   Just how different is their world from hers?::
59834::$$$message_0544_0014_0000$$$::She thinks of her stern, difficult education, and of the Magic Crest engraved in her arm.[lr]::
59835::$$$message_0544_0014_0001$$$::She isn't comparing the severity of their upbringing as successors.[lr]::
59836::$$$message_0544_0014_0002$$$::To begin with, no one else has borne struggles and overcome obstacles like she has.[lr]::
59837::$$$message_0544_0014_0003$$$::Rin Tohsaka has, without a doubt, faced greater challenges and adversity.[lr]::
59838::$$$message_0544_0014_0004$$$::That's what it means to be recognized as an Average One[line2]a mage wielding all five great elements[line2]and personally inducted into the Mage's Association as a prodigy.::
59839::$$$message_0544_0015_0000$$$::If she was asked to command this nest of insects, she could come up with a more effective formula in half a year flat.[lr]::
59840::$$$message_0544_0015_0001$$$::Rin Tohsaka could rewrite the magecraft that the Matou heir hasn't even mastered after a decade, in a mere six months.::
59841::$$$message_0544_0016_0000$$$::But...this method of teaching is idiotic.[lr]::
59842::$$$message_0544_0016_0001$$$::She could only eat her words if you asked her whether she could put up with being a plaything for these bugs.::
59843::$$$message_0544_0017_0000$$$::The magical tradition that takes place here isn't education. It's torture.[lr]::
59844::$$$message_0544_0017_0001$$$::It's magecraft taught directly to the body, not the brain.[lr]::
59845::$$$message_0544_0017_0002$$$::They must be a tradition of the Makiris, and a preference of the old mage Zouken.[lr]::
59846::$$$message_0544_0017_0003$$$::Meaning...[lr]::
59847::$$$message_0544_0017_0004$$$::That whoever is chosen to be the Matou heir undergoes endless torture.::
59848::$$$message_0544_0018_0000$$$::"Rin."[lr]::
59849::$$$message_0544_0018_0001$$$::"...I know. Zouken isn't here. I don't know if he ran when I got here, or if his home base is somewhere else. We don't have any leads either way, so we don't have to stay."[lr]::
59850::$$$message_0544_0018_0002$$$::She fights down the urge to scream and leaves the room behind.::
59851::$$$message_0544_0019_0000$$$::The girl's footsteps fade into the distance.[lr]::
59852::$$$message_0544_0019_0001$$$::Later...[lr]::
59853::$$$message_0544_0019_0002$$$::The insects swarm around the vomit she puked in disgust.::
59854::$$$message_0544_0020_0000$$$::Rin returns to the surface.[lr]::
59855::$$$message_0544_0020_0001$$$::Her business concluded, she heads outside, when...[lr]::
59856::$$$message_0544_0020_0002$$$::"Shinji. I know you're there. Don't bother hiding."[lr]::
59857::$$$message_0544_0020_0003$$$::She called out to the person lurking in another hidden passage in the back of the room.::
59858::$$$message_0544_0021_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, you..."[lr]::
59859::$$$message_0544_0021_0001$$$::"Hmph. I was going to ignore you and go home, but I've changed my mind. Let's talk, Matou."[lr]::
59860::$$$message_0544_0021_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
59861::$$$message_0544_0021_0003$$$::Glaring hatefully at Rin, Shinji obeys.::
59862::$$$message_0544_0022_0000$$$::He clearly showed himself because he's afraid of her.[lr]::
59863::$$$message_0544_0022_0001$$$::Not because of the threat she poses as a Master with a Servant. He's simply intimidated by the fierce air she's giving off.::
59864::$$$message_0544_0023_0000$$$::"D-don't mess with me. I have nothing to say. Besides, the Tohsakas aren't supposed to interfere with the Matous. What are you even doing here?"[lr]::
59865::$$$message_0544_0023_0001$$$::"Oh, but we're schoolmates, too. I don't think it's weird if I come over to hang out."::
59866::$$$message_0544_0024_0000$$$::"Ha! Don't make me laugh. You call breaking and entering, then making a mess of things 'hanging out?' Hmph. I heard you lost your manners ever since your dad died, and I guess it's true. The Tohsakas must be pretty stupid, if they're resorting to robbery."::
59867::$$$message_0544_0025_0000$$$::"Is that what this looks like? Hmm...that doesn't sound so bad.[lr]::
59868::$$$message_0544_0025_0001$$$::There's nothing here to steal, but how about some robbery?[lr]::
59869::$$$message_0544_0025_0002$$$::Robbery is when you manhandle anyone you run into after you break in.[lr]::
59870::$$$message_0544_0025_0003$$$::...Yeah. I think I feel like that right now."[lr]::
59871::$$$message_0544_0025_0004$$$::It's obviously a joke,[lr]::
59872::$$$message_0544_0025_0005$$$::but she isn't smiling.[lr]::
59873::$$$message_0544_0025_0006$$$::Rin practically pins Shinji to the wall with her icy glare.::
59874::$$$message_0544_0026_0000$$$::"...! Y-you're wrong, idiot! I have nothing to do with him. I'm not working with Zouken! I have no idea what the geezer's been up to this whole time!"[lr]::
59875::$$$message_0544_0026_0001$$$::"Are you sure about that? How'd you become a Master, then?"[lr]::
59876::$$$message_0544_0026_0002$$$::"Well, I..."::
59877::$$$message_0544_0027_0000$$$::He gulps.[lr]::
59878::$$$message_0544_0027_0001$$$::Shinji swallows whatever he was about to say, even as Rin urges him to continue.[lr]::
59879::$$$message_0544_0027_0002$$$::If it's about Zouken, he probably would have spilled his guts right away.[lr]::
59880::$$$message_0544_0027_0003$$$::Rin Tohsaka is dangerous right now. There's no telling what she might do if he says one wrong word.[lr]::
59881::$$$message_0544_0027_0004$$$::   This sucks.[lr]::
59882::$$$message_0544_0027_0005$$$::She might be so mad that she might actually try to kill him.::
59883::$$$message_0544_0028_0000$$$::"You what?"[lr]::
59884::$$$message_0544_0028_0001$$$::"I, uh..."[lr]::
59885::$$$message_0544_0028_0002$$$::But he can't say it.[lr]::
59886::$$$message_0544_0028_0003$$$::He's as good as dead if he tells her how he became a Master.[lr]::
59887::$$$message_0544_0028_0004$$$::Even if...::
59888::$$$message_0544_0029_0000$$$::"Then I'll answer for you. You're just playing copycat. You're a failure who can't be a mage, so you're hoping to use the Holy Grail to become one.[lr]::
59889::$$$message_0544_0029_0001$$$::That's your only goal. You're a coward reaching for something he doesn't even really want, just so he can hide how powerless he is."::
59890::$$$message_0544_0030_0000$$$::...it might be completely inconsequential to anyone else.::
59891::$$$message_0544_0031_0000$$$::"Nngh...! Tohsaka, how dare you...!"[lr]::
59892::$$$message_0544_0031_0001$$$::"Am I wrong? You were born to the Matou family without any Magic Circuits. But that isn't your fault. The Matou bloodline thinned out long ago. Ever since your family put down roots in this land, they've neglected their original pursuit.[lr]::
59893::$$$message_0544_0031_0002$$$::But you became obsessed with it.[lr]::
59894::$$$message_0544_0031_0003$$$::You got some wild idea in your head about being 'special,' and started begging for something you don't even need. You can't become a mage even if you get Magic Circuits, yet you cling to the delusion that you're entitled to them, somehow."::
59895::$$$message_0544_0032_0000$$$::"Y-you don't know what you're talking about! Screw you! You think I can't be a mage!? How do you know that!?"[lr]::
59896::$$$message_0544_0032_0001$$$::"I know. I can say for a fact that you can't become a mage even if you have the Holy Grail.[lr]::
59897::$$$message_0544_0032_0002$$$::You just lack the talent for it, unlike Emiya."::
59898::$$$message_0544_0033_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
59899::$$$message_0544_0033_0001$$$::Shinji's mouth falls open.[lr]::
59900::$$$message_0544_0033_0002$$$::He wasn't expecting that name to come up.[lr]::
59901::$$$message_0544_0033_0003$$$::It's well enough that Rin Tohsaka is his enemy as a Master. He saw that coming.::
59902::$$$message_0544_0034_0000$$$::But it's inconceivable that she would mention Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
59903::$$$message_0544_0034_0001$$$::He's just an amateur.[lr]::
59904::$$$message_0544_0034_0002$$$::Isn't he just an unworthy mongrel, not even from a family of mages?[lr]::
59905::$$$message_0544_0034_0003$$$::It was frustrating enough that he summoned Saber, but why is Rin Tohsaka of all people saying his name!?::
59906::$$$message_0544_0035_0000$$$::"Ha...ha...what? Don't do this to me, Tohsaka. Why are you bringing up Emiya!?"[lr]::
59907::$$$message_0544_0035_0001$$$::"He's stronger than you, and he has the aptitude to be a mage. Shirou Emiya has what Shinji Matou doesn't.[lr]::
59908::$$$message_0544_0035_0002$$$::...Yes, like you, he lacks magical talent. But his greatest quality is indispensible for a mage: he won't let himself lose to anyone."::
59909::$$$message_0544_0036_0000$$$::"Greatest!? Him!? Ha, don't make me laugh, Tohsaka![lr]::
59910::$$$message_0544_0036_0001$$$::He doesn't have anything I don't! He's got nothing at all! He's just a stray dog who got lucky and made a pact with Saber!"::
59911::$$$message_0544_0037_0000$$$::Shinji stares straight at Tohsaka. His fear seems to have been replaced by his hatred of Shirou.[lr]::
59912::$$$message_0544_0037_0001$$$::Rin just shrugs and sighs.::
59913::$$$message_0544_0038_0000$$$::"...Fine. You really are hopeless if you still don't get it even after I spelled it out. I thought I'd make you take some responsibility, but you're not even worth the trouble. I'll let you get away this time, so run along to the church before Emiya finishes you off."::
59914::$$$message_0544_0039_0000$$$::Rin turns away with an irritated huff.[lr]::
59915::$$$message_0544_0039_0001$$$::It declares that she's finished here.[lr]::
59916::$$$message_0544_0039_0002$$$::She no longer considers Shinji an enemy, and leaves the Matou house behind.::
59917::$$$message_0544_0040_0000$$$::"I'm...weaker than Emiya...?"[lr]::
59918::$$$message_0544_0040_0001$$$::He repeats the words with nothing but loathing.[lr]::
59919::$$$message_0544_0040_0002$$$::But Shinji, his back to a wall, can't even see the departing Rin anymore.[lr]::
59920::$$$message_0544_0040_0003$$$::If he rushes her, she'll kill him for sure.[lr]::
59921::$$$message_0544_0040_0004$$$::Even Shinji knows the undeniable difference in their power.::
59922::$$$message_0544_0041_0000$$$::"Tohsaka...you...you bitch!"[lr]::
59923::$$$message_0544_0041_0001$$$::Bottomless resentment fills his scream.[lr]::
59924::$$$message_0544_0041_0002$$$::"...Ugh, I might as well."[lr]::
59925::$$$message_0544_0041_0003$$$::Without turning around, Rin stops and bids farewell to the boy who was the successor to the Matous.::
59926::$$$message_0544_0042_0000$$$::"Here's one last lesson for you.[lr]::
59927::$$$message_0544_0042_0001$$$::To aim beyond, for something other than yourself. To reflect on other people more than yourself... And to despise yourself more than anyone else.[lr]::
59928::$$$message_0544_0042_0002$$$::That's the disposition of a mage. No matter how much talent or Magic Circuits someone has, there are heights they'll never reach without those qualities.[lr]::
59929::$$$message_0544_0042_0003$$$::...Hmph. Even I never thought I'd ever meet anyone who fits all of those conditions. It's a contradictory personality you wouldn't have unless you were born broken."::
59930::$$$message_0544_0043_0000$$$::"Shinji. You're the archetype of someone who looks down on others while nursing an inferiority complex for no good reason. You scorn everything around you, yet the people you condescend to are superior to you. You're just trapped by this pointless sense of inferiority.[lr]::
59931::$$$message_0544_0043_0001$$$::...You're empty inside. You're the only one who thinks you're stuck, when you're like a balloon, your destination changing whichever way the wind blows."[lr]::
59932::$$$message_0544_0043_0002$$$::"Ugh...guh..."::
59933::$$$message_0544_0044_0000$$$::"Do you understand yet? A guy like you can't handle being a mage, and no Servant will obey you.[lr]::
59934::$$$message_0544_0044_0001$$$::Whatever happens from here on out doesn't concern Shinji Matou. No matter how much you insist that you're a Master, you'll never, ever be one."::
59935::$$$message_0544_0045_0000$$$::Her footsteps trail off.[lr]::
59936::$$$message_0544_0045_0001$$$::Rin leaves Shinji alone in the dark house without sparing him another glance.::
59937::$$$message_0544_0046_0000$$$::"Ha. Haha. Hahaha!"[lr]::
