61930::$$$message_0568_0000_0000$$$::   It's been a few hours since I started training.[lr]::
61931::$$$message_0568_0000_0001$$$::My sparring with Saber can't be likened to kendo.[lr]::
61932::$$$message_0568_0000_0002$$$::To begin with, Saber isn't trained in kendo, and seems like she has no intention of teaching me swordplay.::
61933::$$$message_0568_0001_0000$$$::No, what Saber is literally pounding into me is combat itself.[lr]::
61934::$$$message_0568_0001_0001$$$::She's getting me used to fighting for my life so that I'll be able to maintain my composure and physical performance in a mortal battle against another Master.::
61935::$$$message_0568_0002_0000$$$::This was Saber's idea, and I'm extremely grateful for the crash course.[lr]::
61936::$$$message_0568_0002_0001$$$::I won't be able to improve my swordsmanship enough to matter in one or two days.[lr]::
61937::$$$message_0568_0002_0002$$$::Shirou Emiya can only rely on the body he's trained until this day.[lr]::
61938::$$$message_0568_0002_0003$$$::If I can gain enough experience to respond to a life-or-death situation, that'll be the surest weapon of all...::
61939::$$$message_0568_0003_0000$$$::"I have you!"[lr]::
61940::$$$message_0568_0003_0001$$$::"Ow!"[lr]::
61941::$$$message_0568_0003_0002$$$::    And, as you'd expect...[lr]::
61942::$$$message_0568_0003_0003$$$::The instant I'm distracted by my thoughts, Saber nails me squarely in the chest with a thrust from her shinai.::
61943::$$$message_0568_0004_0000$$$::"Shirou. You must not let your guard down just because you've retreated out of your opponent's reach.[lr]::
61944::$$$message_0568_0004_0001$$$::Try to allow yourself to relax only when you're here at home."::
61945::$$$message_0568_0005_0000$$$::"Argh... Sorry. I did drop my guard there."[lr]::
61946::$$$message_0568_0005_0001$$$::I cough as I get up, rubbing the spot where she stabbed me.::
61947::$$$message_0568_0006_0000$$$::"...Phew. You can be surprisingly perceptive at times, but I have also seen you act with reckless abandon. If you could just rein in that flaw..."[lr]::
61948::$$$message_0568_0006_0001$$$::Suddenly, Saber looks away.::
61949::$$$message_0568_0007_0000$$$::"What's wrong, Saber? Did something happen?"[lr]::
61950::$$$message_0568_0007_0001$$$::"No. Sakura is waving from outside... She appears to be calling for you."[lr]::
61951::$$$message_0568_0007_0002$$$::"For me...?"::
61952::$$$message_0568_0008_0000$$$::...I wonder why.[lr]::
61953::$$$message_0568_0008_0001$$$::Sakura was trying to stop our training because she couldn't bear to watch me get my butt kicked any longer.[lr]::
61954::$$$message_0568_0008_0002$$$::When I turned her away, she went back to the living room looking bored...::
61955::$$$message_0568_0009_0000$$$::"...I'm going to the living room for a bit. Is that all right, Saber?"[lr]::
61956::$$$message_0568_0009_0001$$$::"We have been training for two hours, so let us take a break."[lr]::
61957::$$$message_0568_0009_0002$$$::"Thanks. I'll make us some tea, too."::
61958::$$$message_0568_0010_0000$$$::"Ah, Senpai."[lr]::
61959::$$$message_0568_0010_0001$$$::I hurry to the living room and see Sakura standing in front of the telephone.::
61960::$$$message_0568_0011_0000$$$::"...Um, there's a phone call. They've been waiting for a while. Here you go."[lr]::
61961::$$$message_0568_0011_0001$$$::Sakura steps away from the phone.[lr]::
61962::$$$message_0568_0011_0002$$$::"A phone call...? At this hour?"[lr]::
61963::$$$message_0568_0011_0003$$$::Is it Fuji-nee...? I pick up the receiver, expecting her to ask me to bring her something she left at home.::
61964::$$$message_0568_0012_0000$$$::"Let's see. Hello, I've just been handed the phone.[lr]::
61965::$$$message_0568_0012_0001$$$::This is Emiya speaking[line2]"::
61966::$$$message_0568_0013_0000$$$::"THIS IS NO TIME FOR THAT![lr]::
61967::$$$message_0568_0013_0001$$$::WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION TO [r]STAY HOME FROM SCHOOL!?"::
61968::$$$message_0568_0014_0000$$$::The speaker roars in my ear.[lr]::
61969::$$$message_0568_0014_0001$$$::Actually, there must be some crazy magecraft at work to make such a small speaker fill the room with her shouting.::
61970::$$$message_0568_0015_0000$$$::"Aaaarrgh, that hurts..."[lr]::
61971::$$$message_0568_0015_0001$$$::My ears ring and my head throbs.[lr]::
61972::$$$message_0568_0015_0002$$$::"Hey, are you listening to me!? Are you actually okay, Emiya!?"::
61973::$$$message_0568_0016_0000$$$::"...I hear you, so lower your voice a little. You're going to burst my eardrums if you do that again."[lr]::
61974::$$$message_0568_0016_0001$$$::"...Hmph. I don't know if I should say that you never change, or that there's something wrong with you. Anyway, it sounds like you're fine.[lr]::
61975::$$$message_0568_0016_0002$$$::Ugh, I can't believe I got so worried about you."::
61976::$$$message_0568_0017_0000$$$::"..."::
61977::$$$message_0568_0018_0000$$$::"Well, sorry about that. Anyway, what do you want?[lr]::
61978::$$$message_0568_0018_0001$$$::Something must have happened for you to call all of a sudden."[lr]::
61979::$$$message_0568_0018_0002$$$::"That's what I want to ask you. I gave you warning after warning, but you still went to Ryudou Temple yesterday."::
61980::$$$message_0568_0019_0000$$$::"Urgh. How do you know that?"[lr]::
61981::$$$message_0568_0019_0001$$$::"I had someone keep a lookout... Looks like nothing happened, though. I assumed you had a little mishap when you didn't show up at school."::
61982::$$$message_0568_0020_0000$$$::"Haah. You mean you think I got myself killed?"[lr]::
61983::$$$message_0568_0020_0001$$$::"Yeah. I thought they chopped you up into little pieces and buried you in the hills."[lr]::
61984::$$$message_0568_0020_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
61985::$$$message_0568_0020_0003$$$::Um.[lr]::
61986::$$$message_0568_0020_0004$$$::That's a lot worse than a "little mishap."::
61987::$$$message_0568_0021_0000$$$::"I hate to disappoint you but I'm...not exactly fighting fit, but I'll manage.[lr]::
61988::$$$message_0568_0021_0001$$$::So what do you want, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
61989::$$$message_0568_0021_0002$$$::"Huh...? I just[line2]"::
61990::$$$message_0568_0022_0000$$$::"Enough digging for intel on each other.[lr]::
61991::$$$message_0568_0022_0001$$$::Oh, you want to know about the Master at Ryudou Temple. They already got[line2]no, they were gone by the time we got there.[lr]::
61992::$$$message_0568_0022_0002$$$::They got betrayed by their own Servant. By Caster.[lr]::
61993::$$$message_0568_0022_0003$$$::And then..."::
61994::$$$message_0568_0023_0000$$$::...I shouldn't say any more.[lr]::
61995::$$$message_0568_0023_0001$$$::I've been speaking in a low voice, but Sakura is still behind me.[lr]::
61996::$$$message_0568_0023_0002$$$::I shouldn't mention anything shocking, like people dying.::
61997::$$$message_0568_0024_0000$$$::"Anyway, there isn't a Master or Servant at Ryudou Temple anymore. That's what you wanted to ask, right?"[lr]::
61998::$$$message_0568_0024_0001$$$::"...Y-yeah. Glad you figured it out."[lr]::
61999::$$$message_0568_0024_0002$$$::"Then I'm hanging up. I'm in the middle of training, and I'm sore all over."[lr]::
62000::$$$message_0568_0024_0003$$$::I end with a 'later,' and move to replace the receiver.::
62001::$$$message_0568_0025_0000$$$::"H-hold it!"[lr]::
62002::$$$message_0568_0025_0001$$$::"? What now? I thought we were done."[lr]::
62003::$$$message_0568_0025_0002$$$::"W-we're not done yet! Look, just come to school tomorrow. I have something important to tell you."[lr]::
62004::$$$message_0568_0025_0003$$$::Slam. Beep. Beep.[lr]::
62005::$$$message_0568_0025_0004$$$::The caller violently hangs up. That's so Tohsaka.::
62006::$$$message_0568_0026_0000$$$::"...Jeez. She's mad that I went yesterday, and now she's telling me to come. There's no pleasing her."[lr]::
62007::$$$message_0568_0026_0001$$$::I return the phone receiver to its base.[lr]::
62008::$$$message_0568_0026_0002$$$::I turn around to go back to the living room and finish making tea.::
62009::$$$message_0568_0027_0000$$$::But...[lr]::
62010::$$$message_0568_0027_0001$$$::Sakura is in my way.::
62011::$$$message_0568_0028_0000$$$::"Sakura? What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?"[lr]::
62012::$$$message_0568_0028_0001$$$::"No, I don't have a fever. It's just...you looked so happy, so I was wondering why."::
62013::$$$message_0568_0029_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
62014::$$$message_0568_0029_0001$$$::Me? Happy?[lr]::
62015::$$$message_0568_0029_0002$$$::Is she saying I was happy that Tohsaka called me?::
62016::$$$message_0568_0030_0000$$$::"No way. I'm mad, actually."[lr]::
62017::$$$message_0568_0030_0001$$$::"...You didn't notice, then."[lr]::
62018::$$$message_0568_0030_0002$$$::Sakura awkwardly avoids meeting my eyes.::
62019::$$$message_0568_0031_0000$$$::"...Hm."[lr]::
62020::$$$message_0568_0031_0001$$$::I'm still confused, but I take the chance to finish making tea for three.::
62021::$$$message_0568_0032_0000$$$::By the time training is over, everything outside is suffused in dark red light.::
62022::$$$message_0568_0033_0000$$$::"Senpai, I'm done prepping the amberjack. That just leaves the tomatoes and pumpkin, right?"[lr]::
62023::$$$message_0568_0033_0001$$$::"Yeah, I took care of those. Next, we'll season the sauce and grill them once that's done... Oh, and I'm going to steam the egg custard, so get the big bowls. Fuji-nee splurged and bought crab yesterday, for some reason."::
62024::$$$message_0568_0034_0000$$$::"Oh, you're adding crab-flavored fish cake! I love the way they look and taste."[lr]::
62025::$$$message_0568_0034_0001$$$::With a huff of exertion, Sakura sets the bowls down on the kitchen counter.[lr]::
62026::$$$message_0568_0034_0002$$$::I put my heart into making dinner as thanks for everyone's help during breakfast and lunch.::
62027::$$$message_0568_0035_0000$$$::I'd prefer it if Sakura relaxed in the living room like Saber, but she's stubborn about helping as she always does.::
62028::$$$message_0568_0036_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
62029::$$$message_0568_0036_0001$$$::In the middle of the dinner hustle,[lr]::
62030::$$$message_0568_0036_0002$$$::the doorbell rings.[lr]::
62031::$$$message_0568_0036_0003$$$::Sakura's here next to me, so it must be a visitor.::
62032::$$$message_0568_0037_0000$$$::"I'll go get it. If they're selling newspapers, I'll turn them down."[lr]::
62033::$$$message_0568_0037_0001$$$::"Sakura?"[lr]::
62034::$$$message_0568_0037_0002$$$::Sakura goes to the house entrance before I can stop her.::
62035::$$$message_0568_0038_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62036::$$$message_0568_0038_0001$$$::...Something is making me anxious.[lr]::
62037::$$$message_0568_0038_0002$$$::I put down the daikon I've been peeling and go to check on the front door.::
62038::$$$message_0568_0039_0000$$$::Whoever it is keeps ringing the doorbell.[lr]::
62039::$$$message_0568_0039_0001$$$::The nonstop ding-donging sounds almost manic.[lr]::
62040::$$$message_0568_0039_0002$$$::Sakura lets the visitor know she's coming, and unlocks the door.::
62041::$$$message_0568_0040_0000$$$::    An instant later,[lr]::
62042::$$$message_0568_0040_0001$$$::"It's time to come home, Sakura."[lr]::
62043::$$$message_0568_0040_0002$$$::I hear a smooth, melodramatic voice. It clashes with the rude way its owner shoves his way into the house.::
62044::$$$message_0568_0041_0000$$$::It all happened in a second.[lr]::
62045::$$$message_0568_0041_0001$$$::The doorbell rang nonstop.[lr]::
62046::$$$message_0568_0041_0002$$$::"Hello, may I help you?"[lr]::
62047::$$$message_0568_0041_0003$$$::Sakura unlocked the door.[lr]::
62048::$$$message_0568_0041_0004$$$::"Ngh!"[lr]::
62049::$$$message_0568_0041_0005$$$::Shinji wrenched the door open and stepped inside.::
62050::$$$message_0568_0042_0000$$$::"My broth[line2]!?"[lr]::
62051::$$$message_0568_0042_0001$$$::"It's time to come home, Sakura."[lr]::
62052::$$$message_0568_0042_0002$$$::Without missing a beat, Shinji grabs Sakura's arm,::
62053::$$$message_0568_0042_0003$$$::and drags her toward the door, ignoring her dismay.::
62054::$$$message_0568_0043_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
62055::$$$message_0568_0043_0001$$$::I run.[lr]::
62056::$$$message_0568_0043_0002$$$::By the time I get there, Shinji's already one foot out the door.::
62057::$$$message_0568_0044_0000$$$::"What do you think you're doing, Shinji!?"[lr]::
62058::$$$message_0568_0044_0001$$$::"Hey, Emiya. I'm here to take my little sister home. Something wrong with that?"[lr]::
62059::$$$message_0568_0044_0002$$$::"You're [font italic=true]taking[font italic=false] her home?"::
62060::$$$message_0568_0045_0000$$$::"Hey, now. There's nothing wrong with me coming to pick up my little sister.[lr]::
62061::$$$message_0568_0045_0001$$$::If anything, you're the one who tempted her to come over. I hope you weren't planning to use her against me."::
62062::$$$message_0568_0046_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62063::$$$message_0568_0046_0001$$$::I don't know what to say.[lr]::
62064::$$$message_0568_0046_0002$$$::Did Shinji just...::
62065::$$$message_0568_0047_0000$$$::"Or, what? Were you planning to use my sister as a shield while you sneak around? That's pretty cowardly of you."::
62066::$$$message_0568_0048_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62067::$$$message_0568_0048_0001$$$::He actually went there.::
62068::$$$message_0568_0049_0000$$$::"What are you looking at me like that for? Are you stupid?"[lr]::
62069::$$$message_0568_0049_0001$$$::"Shinji."[lr]::
62070::$$$message_0568_0049_0002$$$::"Ha! There it is! Let's pick up where we left off, Emiya!"::
62071::$$$message_0568_0050_0000$$$::My hands ball into fists.[lr]::
62072::$$$message_0568_0050_0001$$$::I can't keep my cool.[lr]::
62073::$$$message_0568_0050_0002$$$::I...[lr]::
