56109::$$$message_0497_0000_0000$$$::I go back to my bedroom after my bath.[lr]::
56110::$$$message_0497_0000_0001$$$::Once I put on dry clothes, it finally hits me that I can sleep now.::
56111::$$$message_0497_0001_0000$$$::"Haah..."[lr]::
56112::$$$message_0497_0001_0001$$$::I sit down on the floor, shaking my sore shoulders, and sigh.[lr]::
56113::$$$message_0497_0001_0002$$$::Today sure was a long day.[lr]::
56114::$$$message_0497_0001_0003$$$::A lot of stuff happened, and there was a lot of trouble.[lr]::
56115::$$$message_0497_0001_0004$$$::I had to part ways with someone and try to salvage what was left.::
56116::$$$message_0497_0002_0000$$$::"Right, Sakura was Rider's Master..."[lr]::
56117::$$$message_0497_0002_0001$$$::She let Shinji take control, but Sakura was Rider's Master all along.[lr]::
56118::$$$message_0497_0002_0002$$$::Maybe Rider's nearby right now, watching over Sakura.::
56119::$$$message_0497_0003_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I've run into her a few times already.[lr]::
56120::$$$message_0497_0003_0001$$$::If she's going to protect Sakura, then we should have a conversation."::
56121::$$$message_0497_0004_0000$$$::Her appearance makes her seem unapproachable, but I think she's actually a reasonable person.[lr]::
56122::$$$message_0497_0004_0001$$$::And since I don't know when Zouken will cut Sakura off, I'll have to rely on Rider.::
56123::$$$message_0497_0005_0000$$$::According to Kotomine, Sakura's health will get worse the more she uses her Servant, so we should only count on Rider as a last resort.::
56124::$$$message_0497_0006_0000$$$::"Okay. I'll have Sakura introduce us tomorrow.[lr]::
56125::$$$message_0497_0006_0001$$$::Ahh...I bet she still holds a grudge after Saber beat her, though."[lr]::
56126::$$$message_0497_0006_0002$$$::My shoulders slump in disappointment.[lr]::
56127::$$$message_0497_0006_0003$$$::Anyway, we'll all be living together now that Sakura is home, so I should at least introduce myself[line2]::
56128::$$$message_0497_0007_0000$$$::"Who's there!?"[lr]::
56129::$$$message_0497_0007_0001$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
56130::$$$message_0497_0007_0002$$$::I jump to my feet, ready to respond to an attack, and squint at the sliding door.[lr]::
56131::$$$message_0497_0007_0003$$$::...Someone's outside my room.[lr]::
56132::$$$message_0497_0007_0004$$$::They're standing quietly in the corridor.::
56133::$$$message_0497_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56134::$$$message_0497_0008_0001$$$::...Nobody answers.[lr]::
56135::$$$message_0497_0008_0002$$$::The shadow is looking my way.::
56136::$$$message_0497_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56137::$$$message_0497_0009_0001$$$::...Crap.[lr]::
56138::$$$message_0497_0009_0002$$$::I don't have anything I can use as a weapon in here. If I'm fighting bare-handed, I'd better try to get the drop on them first[line2]::
56139::$$$message_0497_0010_0000$$$::"S-Senpai. Um, are you awake?"[lr]::
56140::$$$message_0497_0010_0001$$$::"Huh? Oh, it's just you, Sakura."[lr]::
56141::$$$message_0497_0010_0002$$$::I relax my tense posture.::
56142::$$$message_0497_0011_0000$$$::"Feel free to use the bath. If you need fresh clothes, just borrow Fuji-nee's."[lr]::
56143::$$$message_0497_0011_0001$$$::"...Okay. I already used the bath. I'm wearing Ms. Fujimura's clothes, too."::
56144::$$$message_0497_0012_0000$$$::"???"[lr]::
56145::$$$message_0497_0012_0001$$$::Then...what else is there to talk about?::
56146::$$$message_0497_0013_0000$$$::"Um, Senpai...may I come in?"[lr]::
56147::$$$message_0497_0013_0001$$$::"Sure. What's wrong?"[lr]::
56148::$$$message_0497_0013_0002$$$::I slide open the door.[lr]::
56149::$$$message_0497_0013_0003$$$::Sakura comes into the room, and...[lr]::
56150::$$$message_0497_0013_0004$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56151::$$$message_0497_0013_0005$$$::Something's off about her, in her new clothes.::
56152::$$$message_0497_0014_0000$$$::Someone gulps.[lr]::
56153::$$$message_0497_0014_0001$$$::I realize that it was me, and my temperature shoots up.[lr]::
56154::$$$message_0497_0014_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
56155::$$$message_0497_0014_0003$$$::I cover my flabbergasted mouth and look away.::
56156::$$$message_0497_0015_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
56157::$$$message_0497_0015_0001$$$::It's pointless.[lr]::
56158::$$$message_0497_0015_0002$$$::I want to stare at Sakura, even though I'm looking away.[lr]::
56159::$$$message_0497_0015_0003$$$::I don't know why, but she's making me feel funny.::
56160::$$$message_0497_0016_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
56161::$$$message_0497_0016_0001$$$::Sakura stands in the doorway.[lr]::
56162::$$$message_0497_0016_0002$$$::I finally realize that she doesn't only look graceful, but that something's strange about her.::
56163::$$$message_0497_0017_0000$$$::"...Sakura? What's wrong? Is your fever all right? Was it a cold after all?"[lr]::
56164::$$$message_0497_0017_0001$$$::"...No. I do have a fever, but it's not because I have a cold.[lr]::
56165::$$$message_0497_0017_0002$$$::My fever isn't...an illness."[lr]::
56166::$$$message_0497_0017_0003$$$::She looks down awkwardly.::
56167::$$$message_0497_0018_0000$$$::Sakura's been acting like this for the last few days.[lr]::
56168::$$$message_0497_0018_0001$$$::...I thought I'd gotten used to seeing this side of Sakura I hadn't known before, to being conscious of her as a girl my age.[lr]::
56169::$$$message_0497_0018_0002$$$::But...this doesn't even begin to compare.::
56170::$$$message_0497_0019_0000$$$::"...Sakura?"[lr]::
56171::$$$message_0497_0019_0001$$$::"It's no good, Senpai. I can't hold it back on my own."::
56172::$$$message_0497_0020_0000$$$::"H-hold what back?"[lr]::
56173::$$$message_0497_0020_0001$$$::"Inside me, the...I mean, even when we got home, the thought of how warm  your hand was..."[lr]::
56174::$$$message_0497_0020_0002$$$::"..."::
56175::$$$message_0497_0021_0000$$$::Sakura sways unsteadily.[lr]::
56176::$$$message_0497_0021_0001$$$::I'm starting to think this is worse than just a fever.::
56177::$$$message_0497_0022_0000$$$::"I...Senpai, why...[retainhaze][chgfg textoff=0 time=300 storage=桜私服12a頬(遠)]Ah..."[lr]::
56178::$$$message_0497_0022_0001$$$::My thoughts are sluggish.[lr]::
56179::$$$message_0497_0022_0002$$$::It's clear that something is wrong with Sakura.[lr]::
56180::$$$message_0497_0022_0003$$$::I know I should take her back to her room right away, but my feet won't move.::
56181::$$$message_0497_0023_0000$$$::The silence is tantalizing.[lr]::
56182::$$$message_0497_0023_0001$$$::Sakura drifts closer, like a breeze.[lr]::
56183::$$$message_0497_0023_0002$$$::Her foot catches the edge of the tatami, and...::
56184::$$$message_0497_0024_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
56185::$$$message_0497_0024_0001$$$::Did I shout, or did she whisper?[lr]::
56186::$$$message_0497_0024_0002$$$::Sakura weakly collapses.[lr]::
56187::$$$message_0497_0024_0003$$$::I move my sluggish feet,[lr]::
56188::$$$message_0497_0024_0004$$$::trying to help her up...::
56189::$$$message_0497_0025_0000$$$::...But I don't make it in time, and she awkwardly falls into me.[lr]::
56190::$$$message_0497_0025_0001$$$::There's definitely something wrong with her body.[lr]::
56191::$$$message_0497_0025_0002$$$::She's warm, but her arms and legs are cold. It's like her body has a high fever, while her limbs are losing blood.[lr]::
56192::$$$message_0497_0025_0003$$$::This isn't a normal sick fever at all.[lr]::
56193::$$$message_0497_0025_0004$$$::Maybe someone poisoned her.::
56194::$$$message_0497_0026_0000$$$::I look away. [lr]::
56195::$$$message_0497_0026_0001$$$::Sakura buries her face in my chest.[lr]::
56196::$$$message_0497_0026_0002$$$::...There's a long silence.[lr]::
56197::$$$message_0497_0026_0003$$$::Sakura's crying quietly.[lr]::
56198::$$$message_0497_0026_0004$$$::"...Sakura."::
56199::$$$message_0497_0027_0000$$$::"...Senpai, why are you protecting me? The worms have eaten so much of me. It won't be good for you.[lr]::
56200::$$$message_0497_0027_0001$$$::So why are you protecting me, even making an enemy out of Tohsaka[line2]out of my sister?"::
56201::$$$message_0497_0028_0000$$$::...My reason for protecting Sakura?[lr]::
56202::$$$message_0497_0028_0001$$$::I don't even need to think about it.::
56203::$$$message_0497_0029_0000$$$::"...That's not it. I wanted you here.[lr]::
56204::$$$message_0497_0029_0001$$$::I need you, and I can't stand the thought of being away from you.[lr]::
56205::$$$message_0497_0029_0002$$$::So...even if Tohsaka is your big sister, I won't back down."::
56206::$$$message_0497_0030_0000$$$::"You mean, as a family member?[lr]::
56207::$$$message_0497_0030_0001$$$::...Or do you see me as a girl?"::
56208::$$$message_0497_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56209::$$$message_0497_0031_0001$$$::I don't see her as just a family member anymore.[lr]::
56210::$$$message_0497_0031_0002$$$::I just failed to realize that over the last few days, I've always wanted Sakura to be with me.[lr]::
56211::$$$message_0497_0031_0003$$$::...I'm long past pretending otherwise.::
56212::$$$message_0497_0032_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I love you, Sakura."[lr]::
56213::$$$message_0497_0032_0001$$$::I say it clearly.[lr]::
56214::$$$message_0497_0032_0002$$$::...It's stupid. Once I was told that I would lose her, I finally dropped the pointless act.::
56215::$$$message_0497_0033_0000$$$::"...Senpai."[lr]::
56216::$$$message_0497_0033_0001$$$::Sakura trembles.[lr]::
56217::$$$message_0497_0033_0002$$$::No, it might be me who's trembling.[lr]::
56218::$$$message_0497_0033_0003$$$::Of course I'm nervous, lying down with Sakura in my arms and telling her how I feel.[lr]::
56219::$$$message_0497_0033_0004$$$::I hold her a little tighter.::
56220::$$$message_0497_0034_0000$$$::...It's quiet.[lr]::
56221::$$$message_0497_0034_0001$$$::I thought I'd be more anxious, but as soon as I say it out loud, I feel much calmer.::
56222::$$$message_0497_0035_0000$$$::"Sakura."[lr]::
56223::$$$message_0497_0035_0001$$$::Sakura's shoulders move.[lr]::
56224::$$$message_0497_0035_0002$$$::Her head trembles against my chest.[lr]::
56225::$$$message_0497_0035_0003$$$::I told Sakura that I love her. So I'd like to hear her say that she loves me, too.[lr]::
56226::$$$message_0497_0035_0004$$$::...Though, I don't mind if I don't get to hear it.[lr]::
56227::$$$message_0497_0035_0005$$$::Tomorrow, we can spend a peaceful morning together, just like we always have.::
56228::$$$message_0497_0036_0000$$$::"...Sen...pai."[lr]::
56229::$$$message_0497_0036_0001$$$::Her tenderness makes me gulp.[lr]::
56230::$$$message_0497_0036_0002$$$::Her voice is more meek than before.[lr]::
56231::$$$message_0497_0036_0003$$$::It's a hazy, feverish voice.::
56232::$$$message_0497_0037_0000$$$::"Ah...hey, Sakura...ah..."[lr]::
56233::$$$message_0497_0037_0001$$$::Sakura's on top of me, and acting strange.[lr]::
56234::$$$message_0497_0037_0002$$$::She isn't only feverish, she looks pained, like she's trying to endure something.::
56235::$$$message_0497_0038_0000$$$::"Hey, Sakura...get ahold of yourself, are you feeling sick!?"[lr]::
56236::$$$message_0497_0038_0001$$$::Her body gets hotter, while her limbs get colder.[lr]::
56237::$$$message_0497_0038_0002$$$::   I need to calm down.[lr]::
56238::$$$message_0497_0038_0003$$$::I can't make her feel better, but Tohsaka[line2]no, then maybe the church[line2]no, it would be better to call Kotomine for help than to take her there.::
56239::$$$message_0497_0039_0000$$$::"Stay still. Everything's going to be all right soon."[lr]::
56240::$$$message_0497_0039_0001$$$::"Senpai...I...ah...hah, hah, hah..."[lr]::
56241::$$$message_0497_0039_0002$$$::I need to put her to sleep, first.[lr]::
56242::$$$message_0497_0039_0003$$$::Sakura squeezes me hard.[lr]::
56243::$$$message_0497_0039_0004$$$::...She bites her lip in anguish.[lr]::
56244::$$$message_0497_0039_0005$$$::I told her that I love her, but I can't even do anything for her.::
56245::$$$message_0497_0040_0000$$$::"I want it...Senpai, I...don't have enough..."[lr]::
56246::$$$message_0497_0040_0001$$$::She mumbles deliriously, dizzy with pain and shame.::
56247::$$$message_0497_0041_0000$$$::"I can't...hold out. Can't take it anymore..."[lr]::
56248::$$$message_0497_0041_0001$$$::Breaths get faster.[lr]::
56249::$$$message_0497_0041_0002$$$::Both Sakura's ragged gasps, and my own as I hear it.[lr]::
56250::$$$message_0497_0041_0003$$$::...I'm starting to lose my composure, being this close to her.[lr]::
56251::$$$message_0497_0041_0004$$$::Anyway, I need to get her into a warm bed.::
56252::$$$message_0497_0042_0000$$$::"Listen, Sakura. Wait[line2]"[lr]::
56253::$$$message_0497_0042_0001$$$::"...!!!"[lr]::
56254::$$$message_0497_0042_0002$$$::Sakura tries to run...or rather, her body arches backward, and she grabs my hand.::
56255::$$$message_0497_0043_0000$$$::"Ah... Sorry, Sakura."[lr]::
56256::$$$message_0497_0043_0001$$$::"No, it's not like that, Senpai...I...no, I can't..."[lr]::
56257::$$$message_0497_0043_0002$$$::I thought Sakura didn't want me to touch her, but I was wrong.[lr]::
56258::$$$message_0497_0043_0003$$$::Her body is uncoordinated.[lr]::
56259::$$$message_0497_0043_0004$$$::She grabs my hand, but when she tries to get closer, trembling, her upper body jerks away from me.::
56260::$$$message_0497_0044_0000$$$::"Sakura? Hey, Sakura!"[lr]::
56261::$$$message_0497_0044_0001$$$::"I can't, I shouldn't... You'll hate me... Ah...but it hurts so much...and your hands are so warm..."::
56262::$$$message_0497_0045_0000$$$::The hand that Sakura grabbed inches closer to her.[lr]::
56263::$$$message_0497_0045_0001$$$::...I can't pull away.[lr]::
56264::$$$message_0497_0045_0002$$$::I can't so much as let go of her weakly resisting hand.::
56265::$$$message_0497_0046_0000$$$::"Ah...Senpai...no, it's not enough..."[lr]::
56266::$$$message_0497_0046_0001$$$::Her voice is bewitching.[lr]::
56267::$$$message_0497_0046_0002$$$::She brings my hand closer to her, and then...::
56268::$$$message_0497_0047_0000$$$::Her warm lips seek it out, and she bites it.[lr]::
56269::$$$message_0497_0047_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
56270::$$$message_0497_0047_0002$$$::I go limp in surprise.[lr]::
56271::$$$message_0497_0047_0003$$$::Why is she doing this?::
56272::$$$message_0497_0048_0000$$$::"...Ouch."[lr]::
56273::$$$message_0497_0048_0001$$$::She chomps on it.[lr]::
56274::$$$message_0497_0048_0002$$$::There's a slight pain in my fingertip.[lr]::
56275::$$$message_0497_0048_0003$$$::Sakura's teeth break my skin, and my blood seeps out.::
56276::$$$message_0497_0049_0000$$$::Blood flows.[lr]::
56277::$$$message_0497_0049_0001$$$::Sakura's trembling gradually improves.[lr]::
56278::$$$message_0497_0049_0002$$$::I can feel her terribly cold limbs starting to regain their warmth.::
56279::$$$message_0497_0050_0000$$$::"Mm..."[lr]::
56280::$$$message_0497_0050_0001$$$::She gulps.[lr]::
56281::$$$message_0497_0050_0002$$$::I watch her throat swallow my oozing blood.::
56282::$$$message_0497_0051_0000$$$::"...Ngh."[lr]::
56283::$$$message_0497_0051_0001$$$::Her tongue laps the wound.[lr]::
56284::$$$message_0497_0051_0002$$$::She makes quiet noises as she sucks my blood.::
56285::$$$message_0497_0052_0000$$$::"Ngh...urgh..."[lr]::
56286::$$$message_0497_0052_0001$$$::It's a pleasant feeling, like my finger is melting.[lr]::
56287::$$$message_0497_0052_0002$$$::I feel the touch of her lips and the periodic caress of her tongue.[lr]::
56288::$$$message_0497_0052_0003$$$::Moreover, for each drop of blood I lose, I feel sweet pleasure.::
56289::$$$message_0497_0053_0000$$$::...I've felt this pain somewhere else before.[lr]::
56290::$$$message_0497_0053_0001$$$::But right now, I can't remember when or where.[lr]::
56291::$$$message_0497_0053_0002$$$::All I recall is how unsettlingly good it felt.[lr]::
56292::$$$message_0497_0053_0003$$$::She's only sucking on my finger, and yet, the pleasure seeps from my wrist to my elbow.::
56293::$$$message_0497_0054_0000$$$::"Mm...mmm..."[lr]::
56294::$$$message_0497_0054_0001$$$::It's like the arteries leading from my heart to my finger are put into relief.[lr]::
56295::$$$message_0497_0054_0002$$$::Blood suffused with magical energy dribbles into Sakura's mouth.::
56296::$$$message_0497_0055_0000$$$::"Ah...aah..."[lr]::
56297::$$$message_0497_0055_0001$$$::I try to look at the facts objectively.[lr]::
56298::$$$message_0497_0055_0002$$$::Sakura is drinking my blood, enduring her shame. It's calming her body down.[lr]::
56299::$$$message_0497_0055_0003$$$::Then...what's the problem with it?::
56300::$$$message_0497_0056_0000$$$::"...Haah, ah..."[lr]::
56301::$$$message_0497_0056_0001$$$::How much blood did I lose?[lr]::
56302::$$$message_0497_0056_0002$$$::This feeling of lethargy must mean...[lr]::
56303::$$$message_0497_0056_0003$$$::...that I've given at least as much as a blood donation.[lr]::
56304::$$$message_0497_0056_0004$$$::Sakura licks my finger one last time, and then her lips quietly release my finger.::
56305::$$$message_0497_0057_0000$$$::We look at each other, both saying nothing.[lr]::
56306::$$$message_0497_0057_0001$$$::She looks in better shape now, but her uncertainty is still there.::
56307::$$$message_0497_0058_0000$$$::"...Sakura?"[lr]::
56308::$$$message_0497_0058_0001$$$::I finally say her name.[lr]::
56309::$$$message_0497_0058_0002$$$::I push down the mysterious pleasure I felt from my finger, and the worry I felt about what was happening.::
56310::$$$message_0497_0059_0000$$$::"Senpai... Ah, ah...!"[lr]::
56311::$$$message_0497_0059_0001$$$::Suddenly, she lets go of my hand and scrambles away.::
56312::$$$message_0497_0060_0000$$$::"Sakura...um, you don't have to say anything."[lr]::
56313::$$$message_0497_0060_0001$$$::"...I'm sorry."[lr]::
56314::$$$message_0497_0060_0002$$$::Her voice is terribly faint.[lr]::
56315::$$$message_0497_0060_0003$$$::I look at Sakura's face, and see that she has her hands on her lap and eyes downcast, like she's cowering from me.[lr]::
56316::$$$message_0497_0060_0004$$$::"...You must know, Senpai."::
56317::$$$message_0497_0061_0000$$$::"I was raised as a mage in the Matou household.[lr]::
56318::$$$message_0497_0061_0001$$$::...Because I'm from a different bloodline, Grandfather did things to my body to turn me into a Matou mage. That's how I have this grotesque body that always craves magical energy."[lr]::
56319::$$$message_0497_0061_0002$$$::My black rage at Zouken Matou bubbles back up.[lr]::
56320::$$$message_0497_0061_0003$$$::But more than that, Sakura's pitiful, emotional words move me.::
56321::$$$message_0497_0062_0000$$$::"When I want power as a mage, the worms in my body start to twinge. Once that happens, there's nothing I can do to stop the hunger.[lr]::
56322::$$$message_0497_0062_0001$$$::The worms eat up all of my magical energy, and it isn't enough, so they make me want more. That's why I..."[lr]::
56323::$$$message_0497_0062_0002$$$::"...Drank my blood, right?"[lr]::
56324::$$$message_0497_0062_0003$$$::"..."::
56325::$$$message_0497_0063_0000$$$::She nods slightly.[lr]::
56326::$$$message_0497_0063_0001$$$::...Sometimes, silence is the most damning agreement.::
56327::$$$message_0497_0064_0000$$$::"Magical energy dissolves easily into a mage's blood. That's why I wanted to drink your blood. It restores my magical energy and relieves my symptoms."::
56328::$$$message_0497_0065_0000$$$::...Oh.[lr]::
56329::$$$message_0497_0065_0001$$$::Her magical energy consumption must be intense, now that Rider has returned to her Master.[lr]::
56330::$$$message_0497_0065_0002$$$::...She managed to live a "normal" life without any problems before now, so it hammers home how heavy the burden is.::
56331::$$$message_0497_0066_0000$$$::"...It's awful, right? I-I wouldn't be surprised if you wanted to turn your back on me.[lr]::
56332::$$$message_0497_0066_0001$$$::I've been aching ever since I came home with you. I can't think of anything else. You've helped me so much, but all I do is take from you..."[lr]::
56333::$$$message_0497_0066_0002$$$::"..."::
56334::$$$message_0497_0067_0000$$$::"...Senpai. I'm crazy, aren't I?"[lr]::
56335::$$$message_0497_0067_0001$$$::Her husky, strained voice cuts me deep.::
56336::$$$message_0497_0068_0000$$$::"Even when you were so worried and hugging me, I wanted your blood.[lr]::
56337::$$$message_0497_0068_0001$$$::When you told me that you loved me as a girl, all I could think of was sucking your blood.[lr]::
56338::$$$message_0497_0068_0002$$$::All I could hear was the worms moaning. They wanted comfort, soon, so I needed your blood, and I don't really love you, but as long as I get to drink your blood, maybe it's all right if I love you, so...!"::
56339::$$$message_0497_0069_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56340::$$$message_0497_0069_0001$$$::"...I'm sorry. How can a dirty person like me, who only feels good when she drinks your blood, have the right to be loved by you?"[lr]::
56341::$$$message_0497_0069_0002$$$::   Well, that's obvious.[lr]::
56342::$$$message_0497_0069_0003$$$::Actually, I don't know why she's even asking.::
56343::$$$message_0497_0070_0000$$$::"...You aren't dirty at all, Sakura. You're beautiful."[lr]::
56344::$$$message_0497_0070_0001$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
56345::$$$message_0497_0070_0002$$$::I hug her again and whisper in her ear.[lr]::
56346::$$$message_0497_0070_0003$$$::Is Sakura trembling and crying? Am I sad because I can't cry for her sake?::
56347::$$$message_0497_0071_0000$$$::"...You idiot. I'm not going to hate you over a few drops of blood.[lr]::
56348::$$$message_0497_0071_0001$$$::I said that I love you. I've been lying to myself and trying not to notice all this time, but you're really pretty.[lr]::
56349::$$$message_0497_0071_0002$$$::...So don't be so hard on yourself. It isn't your fault that your body is this way."::
56350::$$$message_0497_0072_0000$$$::I stroke her shoulders.[lr]::
56351::$$$message_0497_0072_0001$$$::Sakura leans on my shoulder, sobbing quietly.::
56352::$$$message_0497_0073_0000$$$::"Besides, I was happy when you drank my blood."[lr]::
56353::$$$message_0497_0073_0001$$$::"...Huh? Senpai, that's..."[lr]::
56354::$$$message_0497_0073_0002$$$::"It isn't weird. I'm happy that I can help you feel better, even if I can't cure you.[lr]::
56355::$$$message_0497_0073_0003$$$::So don't worry about it. I'd be in a real dilemma if you hated me for the one thing I can do to help you."[lr]::
56356::$$$message_0497_0073_0004$$$::I give her a light, reassuring clap on the shoulder.::
56357::$$$message_0497_0074_0000$$$::"If you're okay with my blood, then feel free to drink it anytime.[lr]::
56358::$$$message_0497_0074_0001$$$::I'm glad that it makes you feel better."[lr]::
56359::$$$message_0497_0074_0002$$$::...I imply that I'm glad I fell in love with her.[lr]::
56360::$$$message_0497_0074_0003$$$::It's a small, simple fact I can be proud of.::
56361::$$$message_0497_0075_0000$$$::"...I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Senpai..."[lr]::
56362::$$$message_0497_0075_0001$$$::Sakura keeps apologizing.[lr]::
56363::$$$message_0497_0075_0002$$$::Each time, I stroke her shoulder to let her know there's nothing to apologize for.[lr]::
56364::$$$message_0497_0075_0003$$$::She trembles uncontrollably, like a young child.::
56365::$$$message_0497_0076_0000$$$::"I love you, Senpai. That's why I don't like who I am.[lr]::
56366::$$$message_0497_0076_0001$$$::But, if you'll still love me despite that... I have a favor to ask."[lr]::
56367::$$$message_0497_0076_0002$$$::"...Sure."::
56368::$$$message_0497_0077_0000$$$::"Will you help me the next time I'm in pain?[lr]::
56369::$$$message_0497_0077_0001$$$::You won't hate me even if I drink your blood?"::
56370::$$$message_0497_0078_0000$$$::I stroke her hair and tell her yes.[lr]::
56371::$$$message_0497_0078_0001$$$::Sakura stops trembling, and then she smiles, with tears still in her eyes.[lr]::
56372::$$$message_0497_0078_0002$$$::"...I'm glad I fell in love with you."::
56373::$$$message_0497_0079_0000$$$::I feel a touch on my cheek, light yet full of affection.[lr]::
56374::$$$message_0497_0079_0001$$$::When I touch the spot where her lips gently kissed me, I blush bright red, like I just remembered how.[lr]::
56375::$$$message_0497_0079_0002$$$::We've touched each other countless times, but I suddenly feel embarrassed.::
56376::$$$message_0497_0080_0000$$$::"...Well, uh."[lr]::
56377::$$$message_0497_0080_0001$$$::"...Senpai..."[lr]::
56378::$$$message_0497_0080_0002$$$::We separate, kneeling properly across from each other.[lr]::
56379::$$$message_0497_0080_0003$$$::Everything that's happened is flooding my mind, and I can't move very well.[lr]::
56380::$$$message_0497_0080_0004$$$::Sakura seems to feel the same way, and we both look around uncomfortably for a moment.::
56381::$$$message_0497_0081_0000$$$::"...Thank you for all your help today.[lr]::
56382::$$$message_0497_0081_0001$$$::I'm going back to my room, so...good night."[lr]::
56383::$$$message_0497_0081_0002$$$::Sakura stands up hastily.[lr]::
56384::$$$message_0497_0081_0003$$$::I don't have any reason to stop her, and I'm too shy to.::
56385::$$$message_0497_0082_0000$$$::"Night, Sakura."[lr]::
56386::$$$message_0497_0082_0001$$$::"...Yes. Sleep well, Senpai."::
56387::$$$message_0497_0083_0000$$$::She slides the paper door shut, and leaves.[lr]::
56388::$$$message_0497_0083_0001$$$::...Once I'm alone, I touch my cheek again.[lr]::
56389::$$$message_0497_0083_0002$$$::It was an unavoidable ordeal for Sakura, but when I think back on it, I feel warm and fuzzy.::
56390::$$$message_0497_0084_0000$$$::"...Time to sleep."[lr]::
56391::$$$message_0497_0084_0001$$$::...I'd like to reminisce a little longer, but tomorrow will probably be a busy day, and I need to consider how to deal with Tohsaka. I need to speak to Rider, too.[lr]::
56392::$$$message_0497_0084_0002$$$::...Besides, the Holy Grail War still isn't over. I need to defeat that mastermind Zouken and save[line2]::
56393::$$$message_0497_0085_0000$$$::...See, I really am sleepy.[lr]::
56394::$$$message_0497_0085_0001$$$::My mind and body are tired, so I should get a good night's rest and get my head in the game tomorrow...::
56395::$$$message_0497_0086_0000$$$::I'm dreaming.[lr]::
56396::$$$message_0497_0086_0001$$$::I should be asleep by myself, but someone's snuggling up to me.[lr]::
56397::$$$message_0497_0086_0002$$$::I'm physically and mentally exhausted, I shouldn't be able to get up, and Sakura's back in her room.[lr]::
56398::$$$message_0497_0086_0003$$$::So if I'm sleeping with Sakura, it can only be in a dream.::
56399::$$$message_0497_0087_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56400::$$$message_0497_0087_0001$$$::Even in my dreams, Sakura is sucking my blood.[lr]::
56401::$$$message_0497_0087_0002$$$::That's how titillating that experience was.::
56402::$$$message_0497_0088_0000$$$::...I told her that I love her.[lr]::
56403::$$$message_0497_0088_0001$$$::She kept calling my name, wanting me, and I want to reciprocate those feelings.[lr]::
56404::$$$message_0497_0088_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56405::$$$message_0497_0088_0003$$$::Sakura is sucking my blood.[lr]::
56406::$$$message_0497_0088_0004$$$::Even in my dreams, she is sucking my blood.[lr]::
56407::$$$message_0497_0088_0005$$$::I'm literally in a dreamlike state.::
56408::$$$message_0497_0089_0000$$$::It wasn't enough. It would feel even better if she kept going until one of us broke.[lr]::
56409::$$$message_0497_0089_0001$$$::Creation is a gentle delight, while decay is a fierce pleasure.[lr]::
56410::$$$message_0497_0089_0002$$$::It's cathartic for both sides.::
56411::$$$message_0497_0090_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56412::$$$message_0497_0090_0001$$$::What am I thinking?[lr]::
56413::$$$message_0497_0090_0002$$$::No matter what, as a human, I...::
56414::$$$message_0497_0091_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
56415::$$$message_0497_0091_0001$$$::My vision warps.[lr]::
56416::$$$message_0497_0091_0002$$$::Sakura isn't here.[lr]::
56417::$$$message_0497_0091_0003$$$::It was Sakura drinking my blood, but at some point, it became something I don't quite understand.::
56418::$$$message_0497_0092_0000$$$::"Hah...guh..."[lr]::
56419::$$$message_0497_0092_0001$$$::It's hot.[lr]::
56420::$$$message_0497_0092_0002$$$::The ground under me is melting.[lr]::
56421::$$$message_0497_0092_0003$$$::I sink in a bog that's hot enough to scorch me.[lr]::
56422::$$$message_0497_0092_0004$$$::I drown in it, knowing that this is Sakura's body heat...::
56423::$$$message_0497_0093_0000$$$::I'm having a terrible nightmare...[lr]::
56424::$$$message_0497_0093_0001$$$::A sinister vision of a sea of hot coal tar.::
