43484::$$$message_0385_0000_0000$$$::The stone room is illuminated by the light of dawn.[lr]::
43485::$$$message_0385_0000_0001$$$::The light that comes in from the ceiling dilutes the darkness underground.[lr]::
43486::$$$message_0385_0000_0002$$$::Every entrance and window is sealed off, but even that cannot block the sunlight.[lr]::
43487::$$$message_0385_0000_0003$$$::Even this place that should be closed off in the darkness benefits from the break of dawn.::
43488::$$$message_0385_0001_0000$$$::                                                      "Ungh... Haah..."::
43489::$$$message_0385_0002_0000$$$::Whether it's an entrance or window, they were originally created to let things in or out.[lr]::
43490::$$$message_0385_0002_0001$$$::The cracks cannot be covered, and besides, it can't fulfill its duty as a passage if it's completely closed off.[lr]::
43491::$$$message_0385_0002_0002$$$::If one wants to completely avoid the sunlight, there cannot be any entrances from the outset.[lr]::
43492::$$$message_0385_0002_0003$$$::If one prefers darkness, they should dive underground to the bottom without a way to return.::
43493::$$$message_0385_0003_0000$$$::                                                        "Hnng... Ah..."::
43494::$$$message_0385_0004_0000$$$::In that regard, this underground sanctuary is not perfect.[lr]::
43495::$$$message_0385_0004_0001$$$::The sunlight exposes all secrets without reservation.[lr]::
43496::$$$message_0385_0004_0002$$$::The hidden sanctuary was easily discovered, and the owner was eliminated just as easily.[lr]::
43497::$$$message_0385_0004_0003$$$::There are traces of blood on the floor.[lr]::
43498::$$$message_0385_0004_0004$$$::The original owner of this sanctuary was defeated by an intruder.[lr]::
43499::$$$message_0385_0004_0005$$$::The supervisor of the Holy Grail War, Kirei Kotomine, was removed from the stage by Caster's hand.::
43500::$$$message_0385_0005_0000$$$::                                                     "Khh... Ah, haah..."::
43501::$$$message_0385_0006_0000$$$::That battle was already a few hours ago.[lr]::
43502::$$$message_0385_0006_0001$$$::The underground regained its silence.[lr]::
43503::$$$message_0385_0006_0002$$$::The new owner of the church is standing still in the darkness.[lr]::
43504::$$$message_0385_0006_0003$$$::But, the winner scorns herself.[lr]::
43505::$$$message_0385_0006_0004$$$::Caster glares at the darkness with an irritated look.::
43506::$$$message_0385_0007_0000$$$::First of all, she doesn't like this sanctuary.[lr]::
43507::$$$message_0385_0007_0001$$$::Neither the hidden sanctuary nor the secret sanctuary hidden beneath it suits her taste. [lr]::
43508::$$$message_0385_0007_0002$$$::The light that comes in is unpleasant, and she didn't like the priest that she finished off earlier either.[lr]::
43509::$$$message_0385_0007_0003$$$::And most of all, the most important objective has not been accomplished yet.[lr]::
43510::$$$message_0385_0007_0004$$$::She was shocked at how poorly things were going, and she even considered reducing this place to ashes.::
43511::$$$message_0385_0008_0000$$$::                                                     "Fuh, ugh, haah..."::
43512::$$$message_0385_0009_0000$$$::Fortunately, she restrained herself from such an atrocity.[lr]::
43513::$$$message_0385_0009_0001$$$::It's not because she regained her composure, nor is it out of respect towards the church.::
43514::$$$message_0385_0010_0000$$$::She suppressed her emotions solely because of this sound.[lr]::
43515::$$$message_0385_0010_0001$$$::This faint, periodic noise.[lr]::
43516::$$$message_0385_0010_0002$$$::The painful voice that escapes from the woman is like heavenly music to her ears.[lr]::
43517::$$$message_0385_0010_0003$$$::For the time being, she enjoys the spectacle.::
43518::$$$message_0385_0011_0000$$$::                                              "Hnng... Haah, ugh, agh...!"::
43519::$$$message_0385_0012_0000$$$::The groaning sounds of pain come from a girl.[lr]::
43520::$$$message_0385_0012_0001$$$::The voice that escapes her mouth is too weak.[lr]::
43521::$$$message_0385_0012_0002$$$::Her anguish would cause those who listen to feel the desire to protect her or sadistic feelings on the contrary.[lr]::
43522::$$$message_0385_0012_0003$$$::Of course, she is the latter.[lr]::
43523::$$$message_0385_0012_0004$$$::Sweat drips down her forehead.[lr]::
43524::$$$message_0385_0012_0005$$$::Just from watching her cute lips bearing the pain, the cold room seems to get warmer.::
43525::$$$message_0385_0013_0000$$$::"...How impressive, Saber. I can't imagine resisting the Command Spell all night long."::
43526::$$$message_0385_0014_0000$$$::"Khh... Haah..."[lr]::
43527::$$$message_0385_0014_0001$$$::In the back of the sanctuary...[lr]::
43528::$$$message_0385_0014_0002$$$::The girl tied from the ceiling can only pant.[lr]::
43529::$$$message_0385_0014_0003$$$::As long as Saber continues to defy the Command Spell, she has no free will.::
43530::$$$message_0385_0015_0000$$$::Additionally, magecraft so strong that it is visible tortures her whole body.[lr]::
43531::$$$message_0385_0015_0001$$$::The Command Spell pressures her from the inside, and Caster's magecraft tortures her from the outside.::
43532::$$$message_0385_0016_0000$$$::                                                             "Khh...!"::
43533::$$$message_0385_0017_0000$$$::Saber's reasoning is disappearing.[lr]::
43534::$$$message_0385_0017_0001$$$::Even then, the last remnants of her pride are keeping her at bay.[lr]::
43535::$$$message_0385_0017_0002$$$::Neither the binding of the Command Spell nor Caster's magecraft can take away her underlying principles.::
43536::$$$message_0385_0018_0000$$$::Therefore, the torture lasts forever.[lr]::
43537::$$$message_0385_0018_0001$$$::Caster watches that process[line2]the girl desperately holding out[line2]with joy.[lr]::
43538::$$$message_0385_0018_0002$$$::It was Caster's idea to put her in a white dress.[lr]::
43539::$$$message_0385_0018_0003$$$::Rustic armor is not appealing, and most of all, it does not suit her.[lr]::
43540::$$$message_0385_0018_0004$$$::If she is an innocent saint, then she should be in a pure white dress when she falls.::
43541::$$$message_0385_0019_0000$$$::"...Hehe, how brave.[lr]::
43542::$$$message_0385_0019_0001$$$::No matter how much you resist with your will, your body[line2]made to be a Servant[line2]won't keep up.[lr]::
43543::$$$message_0385_0019_0002$$$::You can tell that the Command Spell is slowly infringing your mind, right? You will be mine in less than a day. In that case, is it not easier to surrender and be docile?"::
43544::$$$message_0385_0020_0000$$$::"Khh, guh...!"[lr]::
43545::$$$message_0385_0020_0001$$$::The voice resists painfully.[lr]::
43546::$$$message_0385_0020_0002$$$::Even though her reasoning is melted, she will not yield to Caster.[lr]::
43547::$$$message_0385_0020_0003$$$::Just as Caster says, she will put up with the torture until the Command Spell fully controls her body in the very end.::
43548::$$$message_0385_0021_0000$$$::"You are stubborn, Saber... Yes, but I will forgive you.[lr]::
43549::$$$message_0385_0021_0001$$$::I like girls like you. Your blond hair, petite body, and that boyish gallantness... Everything is so cute. Also, your loyalty to choose death over betrayal is adorable."[lr]::
43550::$$$message_0385_0021_0002$$$::"...Really, I want to step on you and crush you."::
43551::$$$message_0385_0022_0000$$$::She stares at the girl with eyes mixed with hatred and pleasure.[lr]::
43552::$$$message_0385_0022_0001$$$::If Caster puts her mind to it, she could get Saber to surrender in an instant.[lr]::
43553::$$$message_0385_0022_0002$$$::Saber's freedom is taken away just from one Command Spell.[lr]::
43554::$$$message_0385_0022_0003$$$::Then, the result is obvious if she corners her with two Command Spells.[lr]::
43555::$$$message_0385_0022_0004$$$::Saber will become Caster's without the need for such torture.::
43556::$$$message_0385_0023_0000$$$::"Khh... Ah..."[lr]::
43557::$$$message_0385_0023_0001$$$::But she will not do such an inelegant thing.[lr]::
43558::$$$message_0385_0023_0002$$$::Caster should take her time finishing her, since Saber is her lovely tool.::
43559::$$$message_0385_0024_0000$$$::"...Yes. It is boring to control your body with a Command Spell.[lr]::
43560::$$$message_0385_0024_0001$$$::I shall have you become my Servant out of your own will... Yes. I shall destroy your heart before your body."[lr]::
43561::$$$message_0385_0024_0002$$$::She now holds the strongest piece in her own hands.[lr]::
43562::$$$message_0385_0024_0003$$$::There is nothing threatening her victory.[lr]::
43563::$$$message_0385_0024_0004$$$::The whereabouts of the Holy Grail is a concern, but that is a matter of time. Just as she decided to enjoy the fall of the king of knights as a reward for her evil scheme...::
43564::$$$message_0385_0025_0000$$$::"What are you doing, Caster?"[lr]::
43565::$$$message_0385_0025_0001$$$::Suddenly... An emotionless voice calls from behind.::
43566::$$$message_0385_0026_0000$$$::"Guh!?"[lr]::
43567::$$$message_0385_0026_0001$$$::She turns around immediately.[lr]::
43568::$$$message_0385_0026_0002$$$::Above the sanctuary...[lr]::
43569::$$$message_0385_0026_0003$$$::Someone slowly makes his way down the stairs that lead outside.[lr]::
43570::$$$message_0385_0026_0004$$$::A lean, ghost-like figure appears from the darkness.[lr]::
43571::$$$message_0385_0026_0005$$$::There are no footsteps, nor a presence to be felt.[lr]::
43572::$$$message_0385_0026_0006$$$::The man comes down into the sanctuary and keeps a straight face even after seeing the bloodstains on the floor and the girl tied from the ceiling.::
43573::$$$message_0385_0027_0000$$$::"...Lord... Souichirou..."[lr]::
43574::$$$message_0385_0027_0001$$$::Caster's attitude changes right away.[lr]::
43575::$$$message_0385_0027_0002$$$::Her expression changes from irritation and pleasure to that of a tense Servant.::
43576::$$$message_0385_0028_0000$$$::"Why are you here...? I believe I asked you to stay at Ryudou Temple."[lr]::
43577::$$$message_0385_0028_0001$$$::"I questioned you first, Caster. I asked you what you are doing here."::
43578::$$$message_0385_0029_0000$$$::The man... Souichirou Kuzuki's voice does not change.[lr]::
43579::$$$message_0385_0029_0001$$$::A voice with no inflection is more terrifying than any threat.[lr]::
43580::$$$message_0385_0029_0002$$$::An emotionless voice is like a mirror.[lr]::
43581::$$$message_0385_0029_0003$$$::An awareness of one's guilt.[lr]::
43582::$$$message_0385_0029_0004$$$::This voice is more fearful to those who have greater guilt.[lr]::
43583::$$$message_0385_0029_0005$$$::She is not being questioned by Kuzuki, but by her own self.::
43584::$$$message_0385_0030_0000$$$::"Ungh..."[lr]::
43585::$$$message_0385_0030_0001$$$::Caster holds her chest and reports the whole story to Kuzuki.[lr]::
43586::$$$message_0385_0030_0002$$$::He is not someone who can be fooled.[lr]::
43587::$$$message_0385_0030_0003$$$::No, he is the only one to whom she cannot lie.::
43588::$$$message_0385_0031_0000$$$::"I took away a Servant from one of the Masters, Shirou Emiya, yesterday... I let Shirou Emiya go, but he is no longer a Master. If he is smart, then he should not oppose us anymore."::
43589::$$$message_0385_0032_0000$$$::"I see. But, I have not given such an order."[lr]::
43590::$$$message_0385_0032_0001$$$::"It was an arbitrary decision, Master.[lr]::
43591::$$$message_0385_0032_0002$$$::After that, I attacked the church to obtain the vessel of the Holy Grail. I killed the priest, the supervisor of the Holy Grail, but its whereabouts are unknown."[lr]::
43592::$$$message_0385_0032_0003$$$::"That was also an arbitrary decision, huh? So the reason you haven't returned is because you have not found the Holy Grail... Hm. You did go through considerable trouble to obtain this place; it would be a waste to abandon it without finding what you are after."::
43593::$$$message_0385_0033_0000$$$::Kuzuki's words are not blaming her.[lr]::
43594::$$$message_0385_0033_0001$$$::But, Caster only felt ashamed of herself.[lr]::
43595::$$$message_0385_0033_0002$$$::She killed the priest who knew the whereabouts of the Holy Grail, but she has yet to obtain it.[lr]::
43596::$$$message_0385_0033_0003$$$::On top of that, her arbitrary decisions that she needed to keep secret were revealed. What else can she call this other than a failure?::
43597::$$$message_0385_0034_0000$$$::"I understand the situation. Can you explain the reason, Caster?"[lr]::
43598::$$$message_0385_0034_0001$$$::"...I am sorry. However, this is all for you, Master. My objective is to lead you to victory. There is no other reason."[lr]::
43599::$$$message_0385_0034_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43600::$$$message_0385_0034_0003$$$::A long silence.[lr]::
43601::$$$message_0385_0034_0004$$$::After hearing Caster's strong declaration, Souichirou Kuzuki simply murmurs, "I see."::
43602::$$$message_0385_0035_0000$$$::"Then, you cannot be away from here. If another Master finds the Holy Grail while you are away, then your efforts will be in vain."[lr]::
43603::$$$message_0385_0035_0001$$$::"Then, Master..."[lr]::
43604::$$$message_0385_0035_0002$$$::"You may investigate until you are satisfied. I shall remain here as well until you are done. You are not fit to fight by yourself. You need a guard until Saber is under your control."::
43605::$$$message_0385_0036_0000$$$::"Huh... N-no, there is no need for that. I can keep her under my control without your help, and I do not know how long it will take to find the Holy Grail.[lr]::
43606::$$$message_0385_0036_0001$$$::Besides, it is dangerous here. You will be safer if you return to Ryudou Temple."[lr]::
43607::$$$message_0385_0036_0002$$$::"That is true. But if I do that, I cannot fulfill my objective."::
43608::$$$message_0385_0037_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
43609::$$$message_0385_0037_0001$$$::Those words were unexpected for Caster.[lr]::
43610::$$$message_0385_0037_0002$$$::He did not have an objective.[lr]::
43611::$$$message_0385_0037_0003$$$::What kind of objective can this man have, when he has no interest in the Holy Grail that can grant any wish?::
43612::$$$message_0385_0038_0000$$$::"Lord Souichirou, that[line2]"[lr]::
43613::$$$message_0385_0038_0001$$$::"Hurry. If you can't find it, it's fine. I will not question your achievements. Just produce results."[lr]::
43614::$$$message_0385_0038_0002$$$::He tells her simply and goes back up the stairs.[lr]::
43615::$$$message_0385_0038_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43616::$$$message_0385_0038_0004$$$::Caster watches him, dumbfounded.[lr]::
43617::$$$message_0385_0038_0005$$$::The darkness is still silent.[lr]::
43618::$$$message_0385_0038_0006$$$::The footsteps heading above ground cannot be heard.::
