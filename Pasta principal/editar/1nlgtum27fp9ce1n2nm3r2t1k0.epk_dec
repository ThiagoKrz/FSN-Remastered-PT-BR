60709::$$$message_0554_0000_0000$$$::      It's hot.::
60710::$$$message_0554_0001_0000$$$::How did this happen?[lr]::
60711::$$$message_0554_0001_0001$$$::I tucked myself in, closed my eyes, and said goodnight. But the next thing I knew, everything was red.::
60712::$$$message_0554_0002_0000$$$::        It's hot.::
60713::$$$message_0554_0003_0000$$$::Mom woke me up before the noise did.[lr]::
60714::$$$message_0554_0003_0001$$$::It was so bright, even though it was still nighttime.[lr]::
60715::$$$message_0554_0003_0002$$$::Dad picked me up, then ran down the burning hallway.::
60716::$$$message_0554_0004_0000$$$::        It's hard to breathe.::
60717::$$$message_0554_0005_0000$$$::I heard Mom's voice behind me.[lr]::
60718::$$$message_0554_0005_0001$$$::She told Dad not to go on his own.[lr]::
60719::$$$message_0554_0005_0002$$$::He ruffled my hair and told me to wait outside.[lr]::
60720::$$$message_0554_0005_0003$$$::I nodded and did what he said.::
60721::$$$message_0554_0006_0000$$$::        It hurts.::
60722::$$$message_0554_0007_0000$$$::Outside was the same as inside.[lr]::
60723::$$$message_0554_0007_0001$$$::Everyone was all red, and my eyes hurt.[lr]::
60724::$$$message_0554_0007_0002$$$::So I closed my eyes and ran, trying to find somewhere that wasn't so hot.[lr]::
60725::$$$message_0554_0007_0003$$$::When I turned back to look, my house was already gone.[lr]::
60726::$$$message_0554_0007_0004$$$::It must be punishment for not following directions.::
60727::$$$message_0554_0008_0000$$$::        My eyes hurt.::
60728::$$$message_0554_0009_0000$$$::I cry while I walk.[lr]::
60729::$$$message_0554_0009_0001$$$::I know I have to go home and wait,[lr]::
60730::$$$message_0554_0009_0002$$$::but I don't know where home is anymore.[lr]::
60731::$$$message_0554_0009_0003$$$::I stop covering my face with my hand and look up.::
60732::$$$message_0554_0010_0000$$$::I come face to face with it all for the first time.::
60733::$$$message_0554_0011_0000$$$::The town is burning in the distance.[lr]::
60734::$$$message_0554_0011_0001$$$::The fire won't go out. It's too late to change it now.[lr]::
60735::$$$message_0554_0011_0002$$$::This all happened ten years ago.[lr]::
60736::$$$message_0554_0011_0003$$$::The flames burning far away are so distant, not physically, but in time.::
60737::$$$message_0554_0012_0000$$$::"So...hot..."[lr]::
60738::$$$message_0554_0012_0001$$$::My skin hurts.[lr]::
60739::$$$message_0554_0012_0002$$$::My throat burns with every breath.[lr]::
60740::$$$message_0554_0012_0003$$$::My body creaks with each movement of life.[lr]::
60741::$$$message_0554_0012_0004$$$::When I try to run away, my ankles twist, caught on something heavy like shackles.[lr]::
60742::$$$message_0554_0012_0005$$$::Even as a child, I somehow intuit that the death of everyone around me is dragging my living self down with them.::
60743::$$$message_0554_0013_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
60744::$$$message_0554_0013_0001$$$::...It's still hot.[lr]::
60745::$$$message_0554_0013_0002$$$::I claw at my throat, my nails scratching it red.[lr]::
60746::$$$message_0554_0013_0003$$$::Each breath I suck in inflicts stabbing pain on my burned esophagus.[lr]::
60747::$$$message_0554_0013_0004$$$::My eyeballs stop working, and my brain begins to steam in my skull.::
60748::$$$message_0554_0014_0000$$$::"Why..."[lr]::
60749::$$$message_0554_0014_0001$$$::   It's hot.[lr]::
60750::$$$message_0554_0014_0002$$$::It's hot, so hot. Hot, hot, hot. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hothothothothothothot...!!!::
60751::$$$message_0554_0015_0000$$$::"Ha...ah..."[lr]::
60752::$$$message_0554_0015_0001$$$::I remember.[lr]::
60753::$$$message_0554_0015_0002$$$::This is hot. Awfully hot.[lr]::
60754::$$$message_0554_0015_0003$$$::But it's cold. Terribly cold.::
60755::$$$message_0554_0016_0000$$$::Past the boiling point and back to freezing temperature.[lr]::
60756::$$$message_0554_0016_0001$$$::My burning blood has already hardened and stopped. Everything I see is backwards.[lr]::
60757::$$$message_0554_0016_0002$$$::And it's hot.[lr]::
60758::$$$message_0554_0016_0003$$$::So it's cold.[lr]::
60759::$$$message_0554_0016_0004$$$::That's why it's so hot I'm losing my mind.::
60760::$$$message_0554_0017_0000$$$::                                            However...[lr]::
60761::$$$message_0554_0017_0001$$$::                                            What was the cause of it all?::
60762::$$$message_0554_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60763::$$$message_0554_0018_0001$$$::There was a black sun in the sky.[lr]::
60764::$$$message_0554_0018_0002$$$::Didn't feel especially strange to me that the sun was out at night, or that it was black.[lr]::
60765::$$$message_0554_0018_0003$$$::After all, everything was crazy.[lr]::
60766::$$$message_0554_0018_0004$$$::It felt normal next to everything that was going on.::
60767::$$$message_0554_0019_0000$$$::"Ah...ah...!"[lr]::
60768::$$$message_0554_0019_0001$$$::And yet, I ran away.[lr]::
60769::$$$message_0554_0019_0002$$$::I was so scared.[lr]::
60770::$$$message_0554_0019_0003$$$::The fire around me wasn't scary.[lr]::
60771::$$$message_0554_0019_0004$$$::Compared to that black shadow, getting burned to death felt only human, only natural.[lr]::
60772::$$$message_0554_0019_0005$$$::So I ran.[lr]::
60773::$$$message_0554_0019_0006$$$::I knew that if it caught me, it would take me someplace even scarier.::
60774::$$$message_0554_0020_0000$$$::    I look up at the sky in a daze.[lr]::
60775::$$$message_0554_0020_0001$$$::I know it'll rain eventually, and I slowly lower my upraised hand...::
60776::$$$message_0554_0021_0000$$$::"...Ah."[lr]::
60777::$$$message_0554_0021_0001$$$::Slowly, I open my eyelids.[lr]::
60778::$$$message_0554_0021_0002$$$::Not quite fully awake, I stare at my bedroom in a daze.::
60779::$$$message_0554_0022_0000$$$::"A dream, huh?"[lr]::
60780::$$$message_0554_0022_0001$$$::Still lying on my back, I feel relief.[lr]::
60781::$$$message_0554_0022_0002$$$::How many years has it been since I woke up from a dream feeling relieved?::
60782::$$$message_0554_0023_0000$$$::"But...it was such a clear dream."[lr]::
60783::$$$message_0554_0023_0001$$$::I murmur aloud, still feeling the heat on my cheeks.[lr]::
60784::$$$message_0554_0023_0002$$$::A long time ago, this nightmare used to haunt me and make me cry out at night.::
60785::$$$message_0554_0024_0000$$$::...It happened ten years ago.[lr]::
60786::$$$message_0554_0024_0001$$$::The memories were still fresh back then. Every time I went to sleep, I would find myself wandering in that inferno.[lr]::
60787::$$$message_0554_0024_0002$$$::I never imagined that I'd forget about it, especially while I was in the dream.[lr]::
60788::$$$message_0554_0024_0003$$$::When I fell asleep, it would all become real again[line2]the sky that day, the burnt odor in the air, and the inescapable wall of fire.::
60789::$$$message_0554_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60790::$$$message_0554_0025_0001$$$::Even now, I think that hasn't changed.[lr]::
60791::$$$message_0554_0025_0002$$$::But it isn't as raw anymore.[lr]::
60792::$$$message_0554_0025_0003$$$::With time, wounds heal and memories dull.[lr]::
60793::$$$message_0554_0025_0004$$$::Over the last few years, all I really see when I dream about the fire is the color red.[lr]::
60794::$$$message_0554_0025_0005$$$::Why would it come back again in vivid detail, even down to the smell of ash in the air, after all this time...?::
60795::$$$message_0554_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60796::$$$message_0554_0026_0001$$$::And what was [font italic=true]that[font italic=false]?[lr]::
60797::$$$message_0554_0026_0002$$$::I don't know what that thing was, nor do I remember it.[lr]::
60798::$$$message_0554_0026_0003$$$::In fact, I didn't even see it.::
60799::$$$message_0554_0027_0000$$$::"Argh..."[lr]::
60800::$$$message_0554_0027_0001$$$::I want to throw up.[lr]::
60801::$$$message_0554_0027_0002$$$::Just thinking about it makes me dizzy.[lr]::
60802::$$$message_0554_0027_0003$$$::A circuit breaker flips in my body and tells me not to think about it any further.::
60803::$$$message_0554_0028_0000$$$::"I should get up. Wash my face."[lr]::
60804::$$$message_0554_0028_0001$$$::I'm drenched in sweat because of the nightmare.[lr]::
60805::$$$message_0554_0028_0002$$$::I don't want my sheets to soak it up and get all gross, plus my brain is in a fog.::
60806::$$$message_0554_0029_0000$$$::"Wait...what...?"[lr]::
60807::$$$message_0554_0029_0001$$$::My arms feel sluggish.[lr]::
60808::$$$message_0554_0029_0002$$$::In fact, I can't put any strength into them, and I can't even get up.::
60809::$$$message_0554_0030_0000$$$::"Wait[line2]what the hell?"[lr]::
60810::$$$message_0554_0030_0001$$$::Damn it, even talking is a challenge.[lr]::
60811::$$$message_0554_0030_0002$$$::I slowly bring my hand to my face, and realize it's pretty warm.::
60812::$$$message_0554_0031_0000$$$::"...Wow. Did I catch a cold, too?"[lr]::
60813::$$$message_0554_0031_0001$$$::That's a surprise.[lr]::
60814::$$$message_0554_0031_0002$$$::This is the first time I've ever caught a cold.[lr]::
60815::$$$message_0554_0031_0003$$$::I've lost count of the number of times I've been battered and bruised, but I've never gotten a common cold before.::
60816::$$$message_0554_0032_0000$$$::"...Maybe that's why I had the dream. I'm burning up, so I was burning in my dreams, too."::
60817::$$$message_0554_0033_0000$$$::Yeah, that makes sense.[lr]::
60818::$$$message_0554_0033_0001$$$::I can't think straight, so it's little wonder I'd have a dream or two[line2][lr]::
60819::$$$message_0554_0033_0002$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
60820::$$$message_0554_0033_0003$$$::Whoa, WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WAIT what am I lying around for!?::
60821::$$$message_0554_0034_0000$$$::"Uh, wait, why, how!?"[lr]::
60822::$$$message_0554_0034_0001$$$::I frantically sit up.[lr]::
60823::$$$message_0554_0034_0002$$$::Then, I check under the covers.[lr]::
60824::$$$message_0554_0034_0003$$$::This is hardly the time to be worrying about feeling sluggish or tired.::
60825::$$$message_0554_0035_0000$$$::If anything happened, then I need to run to the bathroom in the morning and destroy the evidence. My first priority is to purify myself and then exercise my right to silence.[lr]::
60826::$$$message_0554_0035_0001$$$::To be frank, Shirou's stock in the Emiya household is in free fall.::
60827::$$$message_0554_0036_0000$$$::"...Oh, it wasn't that bad."[lr]::
60828::$$$message_0554_0036_0001$$$::Thank god.[lr]::
60829::$$$message_0554_0036_0002$$$::My entire body is drenched in sweat, but there isn't really anything else off about it.::
60830::$$$message_0554_0037_0000$$$::"That was a...dream, right? Yeah. It was that kind of dream."[lr]::
60831::$$$message_0554_0037_0001$$$::There's no way I went to school while I was asleep, and I've never done anything that crazy with Tohsaka.[lr]::
60832::$$$message_0554_0037_0002$$$::My subconscious went there all on its own.[lr]::
60833::$$$message_0554_0037_0003$$$::After all, I'm still in the clothes I was wearing when I went to bed, and Saber's been in the room next door the entire time!::
60834::$$$message_0554_0038_0000$$$::"...Yeah, Saber would've noticed if I went outside."[lr]::
60835::$$$message_0554_0038_0001$$$::    I sigh in palpable relief.[lr]::
60836::$$$message_0554_0038_0002$$$::At once, the tension drains from my body, and I dramatically fall back on the floor.::
60837::$$$message_0554_0039_0000$$$::"Shirou...? I just heard a noise. Is something wrong?"[lr]::
60838::$$$message_0554_0039_0001$$$::I hear Saber's voice behind the sliding door.[lr]::
60839::$$$message_0554_0039_0002$$$::...See?[lr]::
60840::$$$message_0554_0039_0003$$$::Even that was enough to get her attention, so it had to be a dream. Yup, a dream. It was absolutely, positively a dream. If it wasn't, then I don't know how I'll look Tohsaka in the eye ever again.::
60841::$$$message_0554_0040_0000$$$::"Shirou?"[lr]::
60842::$$$message_0554_0040_0001$$$::"H-hey. Good morning, Saber."::
60843::$$$message_0554_0041_0000$$$::"What is the matter? It's not like you to greet someone while lying down."[lr]::
60844::$$$message_0554_0041_0001$$$::"Oh, I just woke up in a state I didn't expect."::
60845::$$$message_0554_0042_0000$$$::Saber looks puzzled.[lr]::
60846::$$$message_0554_0042_0001$$$::Now...[lr]::
60847::$$$message_0554_0042_0002$$$::I'm thanking my lucky stars that was only a dream, but now I have to confront a different trial.[lr]::
60848::$$$message_0554_0042_0003$$$::I feel slow and I can't even stand up, so how am I supposed to make breakfast...?::
60849::$$$message_0554_0043_0000$$$::"37.6 degrees. Hmm. It's pretty unusual for you to catch a cold, Shirou."[lr]::
60850::$$$message_0554_0043_0001$$$::She casually gives me my diagnosis, thermometer in one hand.[lr]::
60851::$$$message_0554_0043_0002$$$::I already figured that was the case so it doesn't come as a surprise, but a cold would make me feel this heavy, huh?::
60852::$$$message_0554_0044_0000$$$::"Does it hurt anywhere else? Like your throat or your head?"[lr]::
60853::$$$message_0554_0044_0001$$$::"? No, not really. My body just feels all heavy and hot. Is that weird?"::
60854::$$$message_0554_0045_0000$$$::"Mmm...I think that's a better sign than actual pain.[lr]::
60855::$$$message_0554_0045_0001$$$::Oh, but you're a tough kid, so maybe you don't even notice the discomfort. ...Okay, I'll get you some medicine just in case."::
60856::$$$message_0554_0046_0000$$$::Fuji-nee takes some cold medication and cough drops out of the first aid box.[lr]::
60857::$$$message_0554_0046_0001$$$::She's an old hand at patching up lacerations and the like, but it looks like she isn't used to treating illnesses like this.::
60858::$$$message_0554_0047_0000$$$::"Thanks, Fuji-nee. And sorry[line2]I don't think I can make breakfast."[lr]::
60859::$$$message_0554_0047_0001$$$::"Don't be stupid. Which do you think is more important, breakfast or your health? I'm glad Saber called me over, but if you'd gone ahead and cooked as usual, I would have been really pissed off!"::
60860::$$$message_0554_0048_0000$$$::She growls in sincere anger.[lr]::
60861::$$$message_0554_0048_0001$$$::...She's right, obviously.::
60862::$$$message_0554_0049_0000$$$::"And don't worry about food. Sakura made okayu[line2]rice porridge[line2]so eat that if you get hungry."[lr]::
60863::$$$message_0554_0049_0001$$$::"Huh? Sakura made porridge?"[lr]::
60864::$$$message_0554_0049_0002$$$::She must be feeling better, then.::
60865::$$$message_0554_0050_0000$$$::"Sakura, are you doing okay? You seemed in even worse shape than me yesterday."[lr]::
60866::$$$message_0554_0050_0001$$$::"Yes. My fever is down, so you don't need to worry about me.[lr]::
60867::$$$message_0554_0050_0002$$$::I managed to sleep well. It's all thanks to you keeping me company, so I wasn't scared."::
60868::$$$message_0554_0051_0000$$$::...Oh, that's good.[lr]::
60869::$$$message_0554_0051_0001$$$::I thought it would take longer, but I'm relieved that it took her only a night to recover.::
60870::$$$message_0554_0052_0000$$$::"Oh yeah, I totally forgot. Sakura caught a cold yesterday, too."[lr]::
60871::$$$message_0554_0052_0001$$$::"Huh...? Yeah, so? ...I don't like that look on your face, so stop whatever you're about to say."::
60872::$$$message_0554_0053_0000$$$::"Mm-hmm. Shirou, did you try to transfer Sakura's cold over?"[lr]::
60873::$$$message_0554_0053_0001$$$::"Uh, what? Why would I do that?"[lr]::
60874::$$$message_0554_0053_0002$$$::"Oh, you don't get it? Sakura's fever is down, right? So maybe you did something. It's long been said that people get better from a cold when they pass it to someone else."::
60875::$$$message_0554_0054_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
60876::$$$message_0554_0054_0001$$$::I look at Sakura, not understanding.[lr]::
60877::$$$message_0554_0054_0002$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
60878::$$$message_0554_0054_0003$$$::Finally, I realize what Fuji-nee's running her mouth off about.::
60879::$$$message_0554_0055_0000$$$::"Y-y-y-you idiot! I only went over to take her temperature and give her medicine! You're not allowed to make any more of those jokes! It's rude to Sakura!"[lr]::
60880::$$$message_0554_0055_0001$$$::I feel myself blushing furiously.[lr]::
60881::$$$message_0554_0055_0002$$$::I imagine my 37-degree fever just climbed to 38.::
60882::$$$message_0554_0056_0000$$$::"Just kidding! I know that, silly! You aren't clever enough for that."[lr]::
60883::$$$message_0554_0056_0001$$$::"Urgh... That kinda annoys me too, but it's fine as long as that's cleared up."::
60884::$$$message_0554_0057_0000$$$::"Good boy. I'll have the school excuse your absence, so take it easy today. Saber, would you mind taking care of Shirou?[lr]::
60885::$$$message_0554_0057_0001$$$::There's no telling what he'll get up to, so tie him up in bed if you have to."::
60886::$$$message_0554_0058_0000$$$::"I already intend to do so. I will keep a watchful eye on Shirou to make sure he does not get up. Should I also feed him?"[lr]::
60887::$$$message_0554_0058_0001$$$::"Wow, that's a little intense, but it works for me. Thanks, Saber."::
60888::$$$message_0554_0059_0000$$$::Saber nods.[lr]::
60889::$$$message_0554_0059_0001$$$::...Is it just me, or did I just get a vague feeling of danger?::
60890::$$$message_0554_0060_0000$$$::"So, you listen to whatever Saber says, and behave until we come home. I'll buy something for dinner that'll give you energy, so you need to let yourself rest and recover."::
60891::$$$message_0554_0061_0000$$$::Fuji-nee nods with a smile at the impossible mission she's giving me.[lr]::
60892::$$$message_0554_0061_0001$$$::"...?"[lr]::
60893::$$$message_0554_0061_0002$$$::Behind her, Sakura looks downcast. She looks like she wants to say something that's weighing on her mind.::
60894::$$$message_0554_0062_0000$$$::"We're leaving! Look forward to the souvenirs!"[lr]::
60895::$$$message_0554_0062_0001$$$::Fuji-nee waves goodbye and leaves for work.::
60896::$$$message_0554_0063_0000$$$::"...Whew."[lr]::
60897::$$$message_0554_0063_0001$$$::I see Fuji-nee off, then go back to bed.[lr]::
60898::$$$message_0554_0063_0002$$$::All I did was go from my bedroom to a porch, but the effort made me so short of breath I collapsed right back into bed.[lr]::
60899::$$$message_0554_0063_0003$$$::...My fever isn't that high, but evidently, I'm physically exhausted.[lr]::
60900::$$$message_0554_0063_0004$$$::Fuji-nee's right. I won't be able to do much until I recover my strength in bed.::
60901::$$$message_0554_0064_0000$$$::Then...[lr]::
60902::$$$message_0554_0064_0001$$$::Sakura comes to my room, even though it's already past 7:30.::
60903::$$$message_0554_0065_0000$$$::"Sakura? It's already 7:30. Shouldn't you leave before you're late for school?"::
60904::$$$message_0554_0066_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
60905::$$$message_0554_0066_0001$$$::Sakura awkwardly avoids meeting my gaze.[lr]::
60906::$$$message_0554_0066_0002$$$::Just as I notice that she's making the same expression as earlier when she looked like she wanted to say something,[lr]::
60907::$$$message_0554_0066_0003$$$::"Um, Senpai. Can I stay here?"[lr]::
60908::$$$message_0554_0066_0004$$$::She looks up and asks me a question.::
60909::$$$message_0554_0067_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
60910::$$$message_0554_0067_0001$$$::She means staying home from school, right?::
60911::$$$message_0554_0068_0000$$$::"...Oh. Do you still have a fever?"[lr]::
60912::$$$message_0554_0068_0001$$$::"No, my fever is down. I just..."[lr]::
60913::$$$message_0554_0068_0002$$$::She hesitates, like it's hard to say.[lr]::
60914::$$$message_0554_0068_0003$$$::Hm.[lr]::
60915::$$$message_0554_0068_0004$$$::She does still look pale, and it isn't reasonable to expect her to fully recover overnight after how bad she looked yesterday.::
60916::$$$message_0554_0069_0000$$$::"Right, you had a cold, too. But are you sure?[lr]::
60917::$$$message_0554_0069_0001$$$::Don't you need to get your absence excused?"[lr]::
60918::$$$message_0554_0069_0002$$$::"...I'm sure. Um, I was thinking about playing hooky."[lr]::
60919::$$$message_0554_0069_0003$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
60920::$$$message_0554_0069_0004$$$::She means skipping class by pretending to be sick?::
60921::$$$message_0554_0070_0000$$$::"Why? You actually have a cold, so it isn't lying. If you have a fever, you should sleep in your room."::
60922::$$$message_0554_0071_0000$$$::"...Um. I'm saying that I feel fine."[lr]::
60923::$$$message_0554_0071_0001$$$::"???"[lr]::
60924::$$$message_0554_0071_0002$$$::I understand even less now.[lr]::
60925::$$$message_0554_0071_0003$$$::What's Sakura trying to say?::
60926::$$$message_0554_0072_0000$$$::"W-well, I think it's my fault that you caught a cold."[lr]::
60927::$$$message_0554_0072_0001$$$::"Hey, don't just take what Fuji-nee says at face value. That's not what happened. I've been going out for late-night walks lately, so it's my own fault."::
60928::$$$message_0554_0073_0000$$$::"But still! ...I feel fine, so I'm going to play hooky t-to thank you for yesterday!"::
60929::$$$message_0554_0074_0000$$$::"Mrgh."[lr]::
60930::$$$message_0554_0074_0001$$$::Apparently, Sakura feels responsible for my illness.::
60931::$$$message_0554_0075_0000$$$::If I'm being honest, I would feel better having her around.[lr]::
60932::$$$message_0554_0075_0001$$$::Saber needs to sleep, and it would be easier for me if Sakura could prepare the medicine.::
60933::$$$message_0554_0076_0000$$$::"Um, Senpai...?"[lr]::
60934::$$$message_0554_0076_0001$$$::"Okay. Then I'm counting on you, Sakura."[lr]::
60935::$$$message_0554_0076_0002$$$::"Of course, I know you have Saber, so you don't need[line2][lr]::
60936::$$$message_0554_0076_0003$$$::Wait, what?"[lr]::
60937::$$$message_0554_0076_0004$$$::"I'm asking you to take care of me."::
60938::$$$message_0554_0077_0000$$$::"Um... you mean me, right?"[lr]::
60939::$$$message_0554_0077_0001$$$::"Yeah. Saber's still jet-lagged, so she sleeps during the day. I know it's pathetic of me to ask, but I'd appreciate it if you could make lunch today."[lr]::
60940::$$$message_0554_0077_0002$$$::"O-okay![lr]::
60941::$$$message_0554_0077_0003$$$::I'll do my best, Senpai!"::
60942::$$$message_0554_0078_0000$$$::Sakura's expression transforms into a sunny smile, her earlier nervousness gone.[lr]::
60943::$$$message_0554_0078_0001$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
60944::$$$message_0554_0078_0002$$$::A smile looks better on her face.::
