31243::$$$message_0251_0000_0000$$$::After we finish eating dinner, I receive a call from Tohsaka.[lr]::
31244::$$$message_0251_0000_0001$$$::Regarding the incident at school, It seems like there are a lot fewer victims than we had thought.[lr]::
31245::$$$message_0251_0000_0002$$$::It must be because Rider, the Servant who set up the Bounded Field, was defeated quickly.::
31246::$$$message_0251_0001_0000$$$::From what I understand, the students that were in the same classroom as Rider need to stay longer in the hospital, but most of them just have anemia.[lr]::
31247::$$$message_0251_0001_0001$$$::School's not going to close down, and we'll be having classes like usual tomorrow."::
31248::$$$message_0251_0002_0000$$$::"Shirou, what did Rin say?"[lr]::
31249::$$$message_0251_0002_0001$$$::"She says that school's going on like normal. So we'll go tomorrow and look for Caster's Master."::
31250::$$$message_0251_0003_0000$$$::"...I see. Then no one suffered any serious injuries?"[lr]::
31251::$$$message_0251_0003_0001$$$::"There were a few. Oh, I think Fuji-nee's not home yet because she's busy with a staff meeting or something."::
31252::$$$message_0251_0004_0000$$$::"That is good. I am sure she will be sitting at the dining table tomorrow morning as though nothing happened."[lr]::
31253::$$$message_0251_0004_0001$$$::Yeah, I'm relieved too.[lr]::
31254::$$$message_0251_0004_0002$$$::Well, she has extraordinary strength, so I wasn't worried once I heard that everyone was safe.::
31255::$$$message_0251_0005_0000$$$::"...Then, Shirou. Continuing our conversation from earlier..."[lr]::
31256::$$$message_0251_0005_0001$$$::Saber leans over the table with a serious expression.[lr]::
31257::$$$message_0251_0005_0002$$$::"...Ugh. So you haven't given up yet, Saber?"::
31258::$$$message_0251_0006_0000$$$::"Of course not. I will sleep in your room so that we do not repeat last night's mistake. You do not have any complaints, right?"[lr]::
31259::$$$message_0251_0006_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31260::$$$message_0251_0006_0002$$$::Of course I have complaints.[lr]::
31261::$$$message_0251_0006_0003$$$::Having Saber sleep in my room is like telling me to die.::
31262::$$$message_0251_0007_0000$$$::"Shirou. First of all, it is your fault for falling sway to long-distance hypnosis from such a great distance.[lr]::
31263::$$$message_0251_0007_0001$$$::I cannot protect you from Caster's magecraft, so it is natural for me to at least stay in the same room."::
31264::$$$message_0251_0008_0000$$$::"The closer I am, the better I can sense magecraft. If Caster is after you, I cannot sleep away from you."[lr]::
31265::$$$message_0251_0008_0001$$$::"Well, that is a very sound argument, but, Saber..."[lr]::
31266::$$$message_0251_0008_0002$$$::I don't think Caster would use the same strategy since she failed once already.::
31267::$$$message_0251_0009_0000$$$::That's what I think, but if I were to say that to Saber right now...::
31268::$$$message_0251_0009_0001$$$::"...You're too optimistic! That's why you were tricked by a fiend like Caster and insulted by someone with a twisted personality like Archer! It's because you are as overly agreeable as the chocolate bun we had for dessert!"[lr]::
31269::$$$message_0251_0009_0002$$$::It'll be something like that.::
31270::$$$message_0251_0010_0000$$$::"Are you listening, Shirou!? I will not let listen to these 'but you are a woman' excuses. I will be sleeping in your room starting tonight, so please do not escape to the shed in the middle of the night!"[lr]::
31271::$$$message_0251_0010_0001$$$::Saber glares at me.::
31272::$$$message_0251_0011_0000$$$::...Oof, she even anticipated that I was going to run away to the shed.[lr]::
31273::$$$message_0251_0011_0001$$$::I'll have to hold out and try to get her to agree on a compromise.::
31274::$$$message_0251_0012_0000$$$::"...All right. I'll have you sleep near me."[lr]::
31275::$$$message_0251_0012_0001$$$::"So you finally accept it, huh? Yes, that is the obvious choice as a Master."::
31276::$$$message_0251_0013_0000$$$::"But not in the same room. You know there's an empty room next to mine, right? On the other side of the sliding door."::
31277::$$$message_0251_0014_0000$$$::"Mm? Yes, I know, but what about it?"[lr]::
31278::$$$message_0251_0014_0001$$$::"Um, that place should be good enough to protect me while I'm asleep, right? Well, first of all, the enemy won't even come in if we're sleeping in the same room.[lr]::
31279::$$$message_0251_0014_0002$$$::If you are standing by in the next room over, then you can attack the enemy the moment they've let their guard down."[lr]::
31280::$$$message_0251_0014_0003$$$::Oh, I feel like I'm making sense here.::
31281::$$$message_0251_0015_0000$$$::"That's enough right, Saber? To be honest, I don't know about two people sleeping in that small room. We physically can't fit. I think it's bad as Servant to cause her Master lack of sleep."::
31282::$$$message_0251_0016_0000$$$::"Hm... You certainly found a silver tongue tonight, Shirou.[lr]::
31283::$$$message_0251_0016_0001$$$::Understood. It still sounds like an excuse to me, but fine. I shall agree to that plan."::
31284::$$$message_0251_0017_0000$$$::"...Phew."[lr]::
31285::$$$message_0251_0017_0001$$$::Good.[lr]::
31286::$$$message_0251_0017_0002$$$::Man, being a Master is hard enough.[lr]::
31287::$$$message_0251_0017_0003$$$::If I sleep in the same room as Saber on top of that, my processor will overheat.::
31288::$$$message_0251_0018_0000$$$::   With that, the chaotic day comes to an end.::
31289::$$$message_0251_0019_0000$$$::It's becoming a habit to train with Saber until eleven and spend an hour doing my routine in the shed.[lr]::
31290::$$$message_0251_0019_0001$$$::I get back to my room when the date changes and hear Saber's breathing as she sleeps.::
31291::$$$message_0251_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31292::$$$message_0251_0020_0001$$$::I feel myself getting flustered from the thought and try to keep my cool as I get in bed.[lr]::
31293::$$$message_0251_0020_0002$$$::I close my eyes, shaking away any thoughts, and tell myself to get to sleep as soon as possible.::
31294::$$$message_0251_0021_0000$$$::"...As if I can sleep that fast, stupid."[lr]::
31295::$$$message_0251_0021_0001$$$::I try my best not to think about Saber and look back at what happened today.[lr]::
31296::$$$message_0251_0021_0002$$$::The red school.[lr]::
31297::$$$message_0251_0021_0003$$$::A field of blood that would have created lots of victims had we not stopped it.::
31298::$$$message_0251_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31299::$$$message_0251_0022_0001$$$::That blows any frivolous thoughts away.[lr]::
31300::$$$message_0251_0022_0002$$$::The students collapsed in the red classroom.[lr]::
31301::$$$message_0251_0022_0003$$$::She was desperately bearing the sight of Rider collapsed on the floor and the students that looked like corpses.::
31302::$$$message_0251_0023_0000$$$::...Oh, I remember.[lr]::
31303::$$$message_0251_0023_0001$$$::At that moment, I was able to find out a deep part of her.::
31304::$$$message_0251_0024_0000$$$::                                    [font italic=true]I'll kill you the next time we meet.[font italic=false][lr]::
31305::$$$message_0251_0024_0001$$$::                                    [font italic=true]I mean we're enemies, right?[font italic=false]::
31306::$$$message_0251_0025_0000$$$::Though she acts like a distinguished mage, she's never crossed the final line.[lr]::
31307::$$$message_0251_0025_0001$$$::She's brave, strong, and has a charming regality about her, but she's also incredibly good-natured. ::
31308::$$$message_0251_0026_0000$$$::That difference must be her burden.[lr]::
31309::$$$message_0251_0026_0001$$$::...The one area where she fumbles.[lr]::
31310::$$$message_0251_0026_0002$$$::The more she tries to act like a mage, the more she denies herself.::
31311::$$$message_0251_0027_0000$$$::"...Yeah, but man. I'm one to talk."[lr]::
31312::$$$message_0251_0027_0001$$$::I sigh and pull the covers over my face.[lr]::
31313::$$$message_0251_0027_0002$$$::...How do I put this...[lr]::
31314::$$$message_0251_0027_0003$$$::I'd like to do what I can to support such a perfect girl.[lr]::
31315::$$$message_0251_0027_0004$$$::But there must be something unscrewed in my head to think such a thing.::
