33889::$$$message_0274_0000_0000$$$::                                                   Then I see his dream.::
33890::$$$message_0274_0001_0000$$$::The memory of the man who was celebrated as a hero.[lr]::
33891::$$$message_0274_0001_0001$$$::The story of a knight who was not understood by anyone.::
33892::$$$message_0274_0002_0000$$$::It is a simple story.[lr]::
33893::$$$message_0274_0002_0001$$$::At the very heart of the matter, there was something wrong with him.[lr]::
33894::$$$message_0274_0002_0002$$$::He had a reasonable amount of power and a fair amount of ambition.[lr]::
33895::$$$message_0274_0002_0003$$$::Yet, he used his strength in the wrong places from beginning to end, and died a miserable death.::
33896::$$$message_0274_0003_0000$$$::It came as a reasonable consequence.[lr]::
33897::$$$message_0274_0003_0001$$$::Power exists to grant your own wishes.[lr]::
33898::$$$message_0274_0003_0002$$$::Pity does no good for others.[lr]::
33899::$$$message_0274_0003_0003$$$::There's a balance because the actions you take come back to you, or so Kirei regularly says.[lr]::
33900::$$$message_0274_0003_0004$$$::One is fed because their actions circulate to generate more vitality.::
33901::$$$message_0274_0004_0000$$$::But not having that means never being replenished.[lr]::
33902::$$$message_0274_0004_0001$$$::If one lives for someone else instead of oneself, it's obvious they would run out of energy right away.[lr]::
33903::$$$message_0274_0004_0002$$$::It would be like money if it were disposable.[lr]::
33904::$$$message_0274_0004_0003$$$::If others use it, there is nothing left for you.[lr]::
33905::$$$message_0274_0004_0004$$$::It's easy to take advantage of, and it's a given that it'll be used.[lr]::
33906::$$$message_0274_0004_0005$$$::That's why in the end...[lr]::
33907::$$$message_0274_0004_0006$$$::He saw many betrayals, and his life was ended by someone he saved.::
33908::$$$message_0274_0005_0000$$$::...It just makes me mad.[lr]::
33909::$$$message_0274_0005_0001$$$::I want to know why.[lr]::
33910::$$$message_0274_0005_0002$$$::He worked hard, made superhuman effort even though he was an ordinary person, and he accomplished a miracle with his own blood.[lr]::
33911::$$$message_0274_0005_0003$$$::His reward for that was betrayal and death. And though it seems ludicrous, he died satisfied.[lr]::
33912::$$$message_0274_0005_0004$$$::It's not my place to criticize another's life.[lr]::
33913::$$$message_0274_0005_0005$$$::It's not my place, but...I can't stand that one major point.::
33914::$$$message_0274_0006_0000$$$::I've had this dream multiple times now, and that is my belief.[lr]::
33915::$$$message_0274_0006_0001$$$::Usually, I wake up here.[lr]::
33916::$$$message_0274_0006_0002$$$::   Yet...[lr]::
33917::$$$message_0274_0006_0003$$$::It seems like this morning, there's more to this dream.::
33918::$$$message_0274_0007_0000$$$::    He was standing in that hell.::
33919::$$$message_0274_0008_0000$$$::It is a scene of devastation by natural means rather than human hands.::
33920::$$$message_0274_0009_0000$$$::"I would make a contract. I will serve after death, and in return, I would take compensation now."::
33921::$$$message_0274_0010_0000$$$::He weaves a spell of contract.[lr]::
33922::$$$message_0274_0010_0001$$$::Thus, he was changed as if possessed and saved those who would normally not be saved.[lr]::
33923::$$$message_0274_0010_0002$$$::...Oh. This must be how he became a Heroic Spirit.::
33924::$$$message_0274_0011_0000$$$::...From this perspective, it isn't really that great of compensation.[lr]::
33925::$$$message_0274_0011_0001$$$::He probably saved a number not even in the hundreds.[lr]::
33926::$$$message_0274_0011_0002$$$::This is barely qualification as a hero with such a small number, and normally it wouldn't count for the level of a Heroic Spirit.[lr]::
33927::$$$message_0274_0011_0003$$$::Yet the number is irrelevant.[lr]::
33928::$$$message_0274_0011_0004$$$::The qualification is one who surpasses human bounds and is able to change the fate of those destined to die.::
33929::$$$message_0274_0012_0000$$$::Something that upends fate itself.[lr]::
33930::$$$message_0274_0012_0001$$$::It doesn't matter if he is not powerful like a hero. So long as it was a disaster that could not be avoided, however small, that he changed.[lr]::
33931::$$$message_0274_0012_0002$$$::No.[lr]::
33932::$$$message_0274_0012_0003$$$::The world would gain a Heroic Spirit in turn, as compensation for this miracle.::
33933::$$$message_0274_0013_0000$$$::He became a hero and saved many lives that could not have been saved.[lr]::
33934::$$$message_0274_0013_0001$$$::As a result, he became a Heroic Spirit after he died and now repeats the same things he did in life.[lr]::
33935::$$$message_0274_0013_0002$$$::As a servant...as a slave.[lr]::
33936::$$$message_0274_0013_0003$$$::I guess the payment for the miracle is to become a disposable tool, in service of others even after death.::
33937::$$$message_0274_0014_0000$$$::Heroic Spirits.[lr]::
33938::$$$message_0274_0014_0001$$$::Superior spirits chosen by humanity. Guardian spirits of humanity.[lr]::
33939::$$$message_0274_0014_0002$$$::   But they are not ones with free will like Servants.[lr]::
33940::$$$message_0274_0014_0003$$$::Heroic Spirits; Guardians of humanity.[lr]::
33941::$$$message_0274_0014_0004$$$::Guardians do not have free will. They operate merely as sources of power.[lr]::
33942::$$$message_0274_0014_0005$$$::They are extermination weapons that are only summoned to protect the world when circumstances appear that could destroy it. They are summoned to destroy these circumstances.[lr]::
33943::$$$message_0274_0014_0006$$$::The Servant system is nothing more than a ritual that uses these Guardians.::
33944::$$$message_0274_0015_0000$$$::Guardians are summoned into any era. After eliminating the threatening circumstances, they disappear.[lr]::
33945::$$$message_0274_0015_0001$$$::...I would hate to be like that, but he must've been determined to take on that role.::
33946::$$$message_0274_0016_0000$$$::In fact, he might've even desired it.[lr]::
33947::$$$message_0274_0016_0001$$$::Nothing made him happier than being able to save people even after he died.[lr]::
33948::$$$message_0274_0016_0002$$$::Since he didn't have the power to save them when he was alive, he must've believed that he could avert any tragedy once he became a Heroic Spirit.[lr]::
33949::$$$message_0274_0016_0003$$$::With that in mind, he readily made a deal with the world to give up his life after death, and saved a hundred lives.[lr]::
33950::$$$message_0274_0016_0004$$$::...After that...[lr]::
33951::$$$message_0274_0016_0005$$$::He believed that he could save tens of thousands more.::
33952::$$$message_0274_0017_0000$$$::    What an idiot.[lr]::
33953::$$$message_0274_0017_0001$$$::There's no way that could be possible.[lr]::
33954::$$$message_0274_0017_0002$$$::Because by the time a Heroic Spirit is summoned, where they appear has already gone to hell.[lr]::
33955::$$$message_0274_0017_0003$$$::Places where Heroic Spirits[line2]Guardians[line2]appear are only hell.[lr]::
33956::$$$message_0274_0017_0004$$$::They only appear when the world is about to be destroyed by mankind.[lr]::
33957::$$$message_0274_0017_0005$$$::Humans are creatures that perish from their own doings.[lr]::
33958::$$$message_0274_0017_0006$$$::That's why the process of destruction is always the same.::
33959::$$$message_0274_0018_0000$$$::Jealousy. Hatred. Selfishness. Desire.[lr]::
33960::$$$message_0274_0018_0001$$$::The man who loved and tried to be of help to others was shown the same ugliness even after he died.[lr]::
33961::$$$message_0274_0018_0002$$$::He is summoned to such places and fulfills his responsibilities, just as the contract says.::
33962::$$$message_0274_0019_0000$$$::   He killed.[lr]::
33963::$$$message_0274_0019_0001$$$::He killed and killed and killed and killed. He killed all the humans where he was summoned to save humanity as a whole.[lr]::
33964::$$$message_0274_0019_0002$$$::I don't know how many times he repeated it... Nor do I have the means to know how many more times he will continue to repeat it.::
33965::$$$message_0274_0020_0000$$$::...There's only one thing I can say.[lr]::
33966::$$$message_0274_0020_0001$$$::He has been betrayed by many things...[lr]::
33967::$$$message_0274_0020_0002$$$::But in the end, he was betrayed by the only thing he believed in: his ideals.::
33968::$$$message_0274_0021_0000$$$::"Geez..."[lr]::
33969::$$$message_0274_0021_0001$$$::When I wake up, I have nothing useful to say.[lr]::
33970::$$$message_0274_0021_0002$$$::My body feels strangely tired and I can't move from the bed.[lr]::
33971::$$$message_0274_0021_0003$$$::My mind is the only thing that's clear, and still I blankly stare at the ceiling.::
33972::$$$message_0274_0022_0000$$$::"...I had a feeling. That was his memory after all."[lr]::
33973::$$$message_0274_0022_0001$$$::I sigh and gaze at the ceiling.[lr]::
33974::$$$message_0274_0022_0002$$$::...This sucks.[lr]::
33975::$$$message_0274_0022_0003$$$::He could've told me that I might get a glimpse of his memories while I'm sleeping since Masters and Servants are connected spiritually.[lr]::
33976::$$$message_0274_0022_0004$$$::If he told me, I could've cut my consciousness so I wouldn't have to deal with that.::
33977::$$$message_0274_0023_0000$$$::"...I should get up. I have a lot to do today."[lr]::
33978::$$$message_0274_0023_0001$$$::I get my body out of bed.[lr]::
33979::$$$message_0274_0023_0002$$$::My body feels heavy, and my eyelids are as heavy as stone.[lr]::
33980::$$$message_0274_0023_0003$$$::I resent how I'm not a morning person and slowly change from my pajamas to my uniform.::
33981::$$$message_0274_0024_0000$$$::"But, well..."[lr]::
33982::$$$message_0274_0024_0001$$$::I'm not sure whether it makes sense or it was unexpected.[lr]::
33983::$$$message_0274_0024_0002$$$::He used to be a pretty hot-blooded man back in the day.[lr]::
33984::$$$message_0274_0024_0003$$$::I don't know what hero he was, but he seemed more honest in the past.::
33985::$$$message_0274_0025_0000$$$::"...Well, I guess it's natural for his personality to get twisted after living a life like that and yet having to be in such a situation even after death."[lr]::
33986::$$$message_0274_0025_0001$$$::I have a brief laugh.[lr]::
33987::$$$message_0274_0025_0002$$$::My reflection in the mirror looks so serious like I'm about to cry, so I try to laugh it off.[lr]::
33988::$$$message_0274_0025_0003$$$::Otherwise I won't be able to face Archer at all.::
33989::$$$message_0274_0026_0000$$$::I get ready and drink the freshly brewed tea in the living room.[lr]::
33990::$$$message_0274_0026_0001$$$::I don't usually eat breakfast, so I'm quick.[lr]::
33991::$$$message_0274_0026_0002$$$::There's fifteen minutes until I have to leave for school. This cup of tea is like a ritual I perform every morning to wake my half-asleep body.[lr]::
33992::$$$message_0274_0026_0003$$$::"Rin, how long are you going to be playing around for?"[lr]::
33993::$$$message_0274_0026_0004$$$::Yet, there's one fool that can't read the room.::
33994::$$$message_0274_0027_0000$$$::"Until 7:30. I'll be late if I stay longer than that."[lr]::
33995::$$$message_0274_0027_0001$$$::"I'm not asking about when you have to leave for school. I'm asking about the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
33996::$$$message_0274_0027_0002$$$::...It's not a bad thing to pair with other Masters. But the partner you chose is too weak."[lr]::
33997::$$$message_0274_0027_0003$$$::"...Ugh."[lr]::
33998::$$$message_0274_0027_0004$$$::That again?[lr]::
33999::$$$message_0274_0027_0005$$$::Archer keeps on suggesting that I cut off my truce with Shirou Emiya at every chance he gets.::
34000::$$$message_0274_0028_0000$$$::"I told you I have no intention of doing so. You say that, but I think he's fit for it. It's true he's not much help in battle, but he's perfect as an ally.[lr]::
34001::$$$message_0274_0028_0001$$$::...Because, well, I think he would never betray me no matter what."::
34002::$$$message_0274_0029_0000$$$::"Trust is a point of negotiation. I cannot trust someone without a reason in return. Look, that is not someone who can survive and win. If you are to choose an ally, Caster's Master is more clever."[lr]::
34003::$$$message_0274_0029_0001$$$::"Don't be ridiculous, Archer. You're telling me to stoop so low to match their devilishness?"[lr]::
34004::$$$message_0274_0029_0002$$$::I set my teacup down and look at Archer.[lr]::
34005::$$$message_0274_0029_0003$$$::Even if it was sarcasm, I can't ignore his implication.::
34006::$$$message_0274_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34007::$$$message_0274_0030_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34008::$$$message_0274_0030_0002$$$::...The atmosphere freezes.[lr]::
34009::$$$message_0274_0030_0003$$$::I'm seriously getting pissed, and Archer looks like he has no intention of backing down.[lr]::
34010::$$$message_0274_0030_0004$$$::We stare each other down.::
34011::$$$message_0274_0031_0000$$$::"It's true that Caster is a schemer, but she is indeed like a mage.[lr]::
34012::$$$message_0274_0031_0001$$$::In that regard, you are not suited for battle. If you're a mage, you should prioritize results over ambitions."[lr]::
34013::$$$message_0274_0031_0002$$$::"Your cynicism won't get you anywhere. I won't change my policy."[lr]::
34014::$$$message_0274_0031_0003$$$::"...The hell is your problem, anyway? You've been acting strange ever since you met Shirou Emiya. Where did that rationality of yours go?"::
34015::$$$message_0274_0032_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34016::$$$message_0274_0032_0001$$$::...Hmph.[lr]::
34017::$$$message_0274_0032_0002$$$::I realize that without you even having to say it.[lr]::
34018::$$$message_0274_0032_0003$$$::But I can't help it.[lr]::
34019::$$$message_0274_0032_0004$$$::He hasn't gained anything even though he's a mage, and he's dangerously narrow-minded.[lr]::
34020::$$$message_0274_0032_0005$$$::There's no use in trying to scheme against such a guy, and besides...he's, um...::
34021::$$$message_0274_0033_0000$$$::"Rin? What happened? Finally get a bead on your own stupidity?"[lr]::
34022::$$$message_0274_0033_0001$$$::"...Yes. I suppose there's something wrong with me.[lr]::
34023::$$$message_0274_0033_0002$$$::But Archer. This is all your fault for letting me know things."[lr]::
34024::$$$message_0274_0033_0003$$$::"What?"::
34025::$$$message_0274_0034_0000$$$::"...Never mind, forget it. Anyway, you're my Servant, got that? I'm only going to do what I believe is right. I'm not as na√Øve as Emiya, but I do have things I won't give up on. No matter who is telling me to."::
34026::$$$message_0274_0035_0000$$$::I can't clamp down on the anger.[lr]::
34027::$$$message_0274_0035_0001$$$::   And that makes me realize...[lr]::
34028::$$$message_0274_0035_0002$$$::I don't feel any sympathy, even after learning about his past.[lr]::
34029::$$$message_0274_0035_0003$$$::I'm just mad.::
34030::$$$message_0274_0036_0000$$$::"...Hmph. I can't hear you, Archer!?"[lr]::
34031::$$$message_0274_0036_0001$$$::So I take it out on him as much as I can.[lr]::
34032::$$$message_0274_0036_0002$$$::The knight in the red coat sighs and assumes what seems to be his favorite pose.[lr]::
34033::$$$message_0274_0036_0003$$$::"Nothing I can do about it, I guess. It is the role of a retainer to support a master, well or not. I shall look after you from the sidelines until you are back to your usual self."[lr]::
34034::$$$message_0274_0036_0004$$$::And he replies with an answer that's neither yes or no.::∞
