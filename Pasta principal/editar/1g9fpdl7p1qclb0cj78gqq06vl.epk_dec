36682::$$$message_0310_0000_0000$$$::...I'm worried about Sakura, who's absent.[lr]::
36683::$$$message_0310_0000_0001$$$::There's that thing with Shinji, so I'll go check up on her...::
36684::$$$message_0310_0001_0000$$$::I go back home to drop off my bag before I head to town.[lr]::
36685::$$$message_0310_0001_0001$$$::Sakura's house is on the other side of the intersection, at the upper part of the residential area.[lr]::
36686::$$$message_0310_0001_0002$$$::It's about the same distance as from the intersection to my place.[lr]::
36687::$$$message_0310_0001_0003$$$::I go up the hill that's different from the Japanese-style residential area.[lr]::
36688::$$$message_0310_0001_0004$$$::Then...::
36689::$$$message_0310_0002_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
36690::$$$message_0310_0002_0001$$$::In the distance...[lr]::
36691::$$$message_0310_0002_0002$$$::I see a familiar figure in front of my destination, Sakura's house.::
36692::$$$message_0310_0003_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka."[lr]::
36693::$$$message_0310_0003_0001$$$::I confirm one more time.[lr]::
36694::$$$message_0310_0003_0002$$$::...Her red clothes are rather noticeable.[lr]::
36695::$$$message_0310_0003_0003$$$::That itself catches my eyes, but her lower half is black as if to emphasize the red color.[lr]::
36696::$$$message_0310_0003_0004$$$::She probably picks something to balance out her dark hair.[lr]::
36697::$$$message_0310_0003_0005$$$::The outfit's very fitting for someone like Tohsaka.::
36698::$$$message_0310_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36699::$$$message_0310_0004_0001$$$::Something thumps.[lr]::
36700::$$$message_0310_0004_0002$$$::Shut up.[lr]::
36701::$$$message_0310_0004_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36702::$$$message_0310_0004_0004$$$::This time it thumps twice.[lr]::
36703::$$$message_0310_0004_0005$$$::...Damn it, shut up. I'm busy right now, be quiet.::
36704::$$$message_0310_0005_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
36705::$$$message_0310_0005_0001$$$::It doesn't stop thumping.[lr]::
36706::$$$message_0310_0005_0002$$$::...Geez, you're not a taiko at a festival! What the hell is it...!?::
36707::$$$message_0310_0006_0000$$$::"...Oh, it's me."[lr]::
36708::$$$message_0310_0006_0001$$$::I calmly answer.[lr]::
36709::$$$message_0310_0006_0002$$$::It was my own heartbeat echoing through my ears.[lr]::
36710::$$$message_0310_0006_0003$$$::Quiet up until now, it sounds ready to rapidly beat right out of my chest.::
36711::$$$message_0310_0007_0000$$$::The cause is simple.[lr]::
36712::$$$message_0310_0007_0001$$$::I've just...[lr]::
36713::$$$message_0310_0007_0002$$$::I have never seen Rin Tohsaka wearing her own clothes.::
36714::$$$message_0310_0008_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
36715::$$$message_0310_0008_0001$$$::I can't imagine what kind of face I'm making right now.[lr]::
36716::$$$message_0310_0008_0002$$$::I can't even explain why I'm reacting like this in the first place.[lr]::
36717::$$$message_0310_0008_0003$$$::I saw her in her personal clothes.[lr]::
36718::$$$message_0310_0008_0004$$$::I saw her in something other than her school uniform without expecting it, that's all, right?::
36719::$$$message_0310_0009_0000$$$::"...You're unbelievable."[lr]::
36720::$$$message_0310_0009_0001$$$::Why am I hung up on this?[lr]::
36721::$$$message_0310_0009_0002$$$::It's just her clothes. This isn't a big deal.[lr]::
36722::$$$message_0310_0009_0003$$$::First of all, we're allies. She trusts me to have her back.[lr]::
36723::$$$message_0310_0009_0004$$$::So I ought to be prioritizing living up to that trust.::
36724::$$$message_0310_0010_0000$$$::"Hey, Tohsaka."[lr]::
36725::$$$message_0310_0010_0001$$$::I call out to her.[lr]::
36726::$$$message_0310_0010_0002$$$::"Ah!?"[lr]::
36727::$$$message_0310_0010_0003$$$::Tohsaka sees me, gets surprised, and starts looking around.::
36728::$$$message_0310_0011_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. What are you doing here?"[lr]::
36729::$$$message_0310_0011_0001$$$::I get closer and call out to her.[lr]::
36730::$$$message_0310_0011_0002$$$::"Ungh...!"[lr]::
36731::$$$message_0310_0011_0003$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
36732::$$$message_0310_0011_0004$$$::I have no time to resist.[lr]::
36733::$$$message_0310_0011_0005$$$::Tohsaka grabs my arm and pushes me to take cover...!::
36734::$$$message_0310_0012_0000$$$::"Ungh...! Ow, my back...! What are you doing, Tohsaka...!"[lr]::
36735::$$$message_0310_0012_0001$$$::"Be quiet...!"::
36736::$$$message_0310_0013_0000$$$::"Ah... Uh?"[lr]::
36737::$$$message_0310_0013_0001$$$::Wait.[lr]::
36738::$$$message_0310_0013_0002$$$::It's really soft.::
36739::$$$message_0310_0014_0000$$$::Error. Processing error.[lr]::
36740::$$$message_0310_0014_0001$$$::My brain is blown away.[lr]::
36741::$$$message_0310_0014_0002$$$::The heartbeat that I had forced to silence earlier sounds like a drum solo now.::
36742::$$$message_0310_0015_0000$$$::"T-T-T-T-T-T-Tohsaka, hey, hey...!"[lr]::
36743::$$$message_0310_0015_0001$$$::"...Geez, just be quiet. We'll be found if you make a commotion."::
36744::$$$message_0310_0016_0000$$$::"Be found... By who...!?"[lr]::
36745::$$$message_0310_0016_0001$$$::"By him... Go on, further back. We're not able to hide like this."::
36746::$$$message_0310_0017_0000$$$::Tohsaka pushes her body onto mine.::
36747::$$$message_0310_0018_0000$$$::"T-Tohsaka, ah, too close...!!!"[lr]::
36748::$$$message_0310_0018_0001$$$::She's so close to me that I'm getting dizzy. I feel like I'm babbling nonsense, but I can't understand it myself.::
36749::$$$message_0310_0019_0000$$$::"I said be quiet...! You can see him, right? In front of Sakura's house. Isn't there a strange guy standing there?"::
36750::$$$message_0310_0020_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
36751::$$$message_0310_0020_0001$$$::My boiling thoughts cool instantly.[lr]::
36752::$$$message_0310_0020_0002$$$::A strange guy standing in front of Sakura's house...?::
36753::$$$message_0310_0021_0000$$$::"...There is someone there. Blond... A foreigner?"[lr]::
36754::$$$message_0310_0021_0001$$$::"Yeah. He's been in front of the Matou house for about thirty minutes now.[lr]::
36755::$$$message_0310_0021_0002$$$::It doesn't seem like he's spying... But the look in his eyes gets on my nerves."::
36756::$$$message_0310_0022_0000$$$::...Unfortunately, I can't see the look in his eyes from here.[lr]::
36757::$$$message_0310_0022_0001$$$::"Tohsaka, let's switch places. I want to see too."::
36758::$$$message_0310_0023_0000$$$::"Hey! We can't, idiot! He'll see us if we go out now... Wait, he's coming. He's coming this way...!"[lr]::
36759::$$$message_0310_0023_0001$$$::"...!"[lr]::
36760::$$$message_0310_0023_0002$$$::We bend down to try to hide ourselves in the confined space.::
36761::$$$message_0310_0024_0000$$$::...The footsteps approach.[lr]::
36762::$$$message_0310_0024_0001$$$::He goes down the hill without stopping.::
36763::$$$message_0310_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36764::$$$message_0310_0025_0001$$$::...What was that about?[lr]::
36765::$$$message_0310_0025_0002$$$::I think he's a normal human being.[lr]::
36766::$$$message_0310_0025_0003$$$::He seems like a real, full-fledged human with form.::
36767::$$$message_0310_0026_0000$$$::Yet, I still feel something weird.[lr]::
36768::$$$message_0310_0026_0001$$$::I don't know who he is.[lr]::
36769::$$$message_0310_0026_0002$$$::But I have this strange feeling our lives will come to an end if we go after him.[lr]::
36770::$$$message_0310_0026_0003$$$::...It's such a strange, unnerving presence. ::
36771::$$$message_0310_0027_0000$$$::"That guy... Is he the one who was talking to Sakura before?"[lr]::
36772::$$$message_0310_0027_0001$$$::Tohsaka murmurs.[lr]::
36773::$$$message_0310_0027_0002$$$::"Wha[line2]with Sakura...!?"::
36774::$$$message_0310_0028_0000$$$::"Yes. Apparently he asked Sakura for directions, but she couldn't tell what he was saying[line2]Wait, whaaat!!!???"::
36775::$$$message_0310_0029_0000$$$::"W-what are you doing here!?"[lr]::
36776::$$$message_0310_0029_0001$$$::Tohsaka jumps out of the back alley as fast as Lancer.::
36777::$$$message_0310_0030_0000$$$::"...Well, that's my question. But you took me and shoved me in there like an overdue package."[lr]::
36778::$$$message_0310_0030_0001$$$::I explain precisely to her.::
36779::$$$message_0310_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36780::$$$message_0310_0031_0001$$$::She must've understood as she freezes.::
36781::$$$message_0310_0032_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36782::$$$message_0310_0032_0001$$$::...Well, she stopped with the unreasonable complaints, but now she's just glaring at me.::
36783::$$$message_0310_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36784::$$$message_0310_0033_0001$$$::Hey, I'm the one that's annoyed, here.[lr]::
36785::$$$message_0310_0033_0002$$$::You're the one who dragged me in like that.[lr]::
36786::$$$message_0310_0033_0003$$$::It's not fair that only Tohsaka gets to make a face like that.[lr]::
36787::$$$message_0310_0033_0004$$$::She shouldn't have done it if she didn't want to. I feel stupid getting all embarrassed about it, damn it.::
36788::$$$message_0310_0034_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka. Issei has nothing to do with this."[lr]::
36789::$$$message_0310_0034_0001$$$::I say, while turning away from her.::
36790::$$$message_0310_0035_0000$$$::"Huh...? What, you already found out...!?"[lr]::
36791::$$$message_0310_0035_0001$$$::"Yeah. Issei isn't a Master. It's fine if you don't wanna believe me."::
36792::$$$message_0310_0036_0000$$$::"Huh? No, I believe you. You're not a person who can lie. Issei is innocent if you say so."[lr]::
36793::$$$message_0310_0036_0001$$$::Tohsaka replies nonchalantly.::
36794::$$$message_0310_0037_0000$$$::"...Damn it, I lost."[lr]::
36795::$$$message_0310_0037_0001$$$::A sigh escapes my lips.[lr]::
36796::$$$message_0310_0037_0002$$$::I feel even more stupid for getting all worked up about it when she says it like that... Above all I feel better just from hearing those words.::
36797::$$$message_0310_0038_0000$$$::"But, how did you find out? I didn't feel a Master's presence from him. So, I think the only way to check is by attacking him."::
36798::$$$message_0310_0039_0000$$$::"Huh? Well, I checked whether he had a Command Spell or not. That's something he can't hide no matter how much he suppresses his magical energy, right?"[lr]::
36799::$$$message_0310_0039_0001$$$::"Oh, I see. It's obvious if you just look at his arms."[lr]::
36800::$$$message_0310_0039_0002$$$::Tohsaka nods in agreement.[lr]::
36801::$$$message_0310_0039_0003$$$::But she must've thought of something else, as her head tilts.::
36802::$$$message_0310_0040_0000$$$::"Hey, Emiya. How did you check Issei's Command Spell?"[lr]::
36803::$$$message_0310_0040_0001$$$::"I took his clothes off. I mean, he resisted like any normal person would've, but I stripped him by force and didn't find anything."::
36804::$$$message_0310_0041_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
36805::$$$message_0310_0041_0001$$$::Tohsaka freezes, staring at me in stunned silence.[lr]::
36806::$$$message_0310_0041_0002$$$::"...Hmm?"[lr]::
36807::$$$message_0310_0041_0003$$$::...Now I think she's acting strange.[lr]::
36808::$$$message_0310_0041_0004$$$::Like...what part of that was unclear?::
36809::$$$message_0310_0042_0000$$$::...The Matou household was silent.[lr]::
36810::$$$message_0310_0042_0001$$$::Shinji isn't home, and I don't see Sakura either.[lr]::
36811::$$$message_0310_0042_0002$$$::Just as I'm wondering what I should do...[lr]::
36812::$$$message_0310_0042_0003$$$::"Oh, did you come here because you were worried about Sakura?"[lr]::
36813::$$$message_0310_0042_0004$$$::Tohsaka asks, as if it's nothing.::
36814::$$$message_0310_0043_0000$$$::"Mm? Tohsaka, you know Sakura Matou?"[lr]::
36815::$$$message_0310_0043_0001$$$::"Well, we're acquaintances.[lr]::
36816::$$$message_0310_0043_0002$$$::Anyway, the students in the kyudo club are all in bad condition, so they got transferred to the general hospital in Shinto. That's why Ms. Fujimura is running around, right?"::
36817::$$$message_0310_0044_0000$$$::"...What about Sakura?"[lr]::
36818::$$$message_0310_0044_0001$$$::"She's sleeping in a hospital bed right now... Oho, so that's how it is, huh?"[lr]::
36819::$$$message_0310_0044_0002$$$::"...Ugh. W-what's up with that evil smile?"::
36820::$$$message_0310_0045_0000$$$::"Nothing. But I see, you're more worried about the person that always comes to help you instead of reporting to me. Oh, I think I'm starting to understand you better now."::
36821::$$$message_0310_0046_0000$$$::Tohsaka smiles meaningfully.[lr]::
36822::$$$message_0310_0046_0001$$$::It's really humiliating, but more than that...[lr]::
36823::$$$message_0310_0046_0002$$$::"Tohsaka. Why do you know that Sakura comes to my place?"[lr]::
36824::$$$message_0310_0046_0003$$$::"Oh... I-I found out when I went to visit the kyudo club.[lr]::
36825::$$$message_0310_0046_0004$$$::I'm friends with the captain, Mitsuzuri, you know?"[lr]::
36826::$$$message_0310_0046_0005$$$::She says as she starts going up the hill.::
36827::$$$message_0310_0047_0000$$$::"Tohsaka? Are you going home?"[lr]::
36828::$$$message_0310_0047_0001$$$::"Yes. Nothing left here, and we have to rethink our strategy for searching for Caster. Let's brainstorm at school tomorrow."[lr]::
36829::$$$message_0310_0047_0002$$$::Tohsaka says goodbye and casually leaves.::
36830::$$$message_0310_0048_0000$$$::   Then...[lr]::
36831::$$$message_0310_0048_0001$$$::...She looks at me seriously from a distance.::
36832::$$$message_0310_0049_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka?"[lr]::
36833::$$$message_0310_0049_0001$$$::"Hey. There's something I want to ask you."::
36834::$$$message_0310_0050_0000$$$::"...? That's fine, but what is it?"[lr]::
36835::$$$message_0310_0050_0001$$$::"...Um, this is a hypothetical question. If a child is adopted without any say in the matter, how do you think that child will grow up feeling?" ::
36836::$$$message_0310_0051_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
36837::$$$message_0310_0051_0001$$$::What is she getting at?[lr]::
36838::$$$message_0310_0051_0002$$$::A child that is adopted without any say...[lr]::
36839::$$$message_0310_0051_0003$$$::Throwing away their previous life and starting a new life with a complete stranger.[lr]::
36840::$$$message_0310_0051_0004$$$::They say that you can't choose your parents, but...[lr]::
36841::$$$message_0310_0051_0005$$$::If I think about what a child who doesn't have any choice in the matter would feel being thrust into a situation with a stranger...::
36842::$$$message_0310_0052_0000$$$::"...Emiya?"[lr]::
36843::$$$message_0310_0052_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
36844::$$$message_0310_0052_0002$$$::I shake off those thoughts.[lr]::
36845::$$$message_0310_0052_0003$$$::...What am I getting emotional over?[lr]::
36846::$$$message_0310_0052_0004$$$::I shouldn't even need to think about this.::
36847::$$$message_0310_0053_0000$$$::"Well, I don't think there's a specific thing they'd feel. If the place they're adopted to is good, then I'm sure they won't have any complaints. But I'm sure there'll be some issues if it isn't any good. Kids are pretty simple, you know."[lr]::
36848::$$$message_0310_0053_0001$$$::"...I see. That's true. Why am I asking such an obvious question?"::
36849::$$$message_0310_0054_0000$$$::Tohsaka waves goodbye and goes up the hill.[lr]::
36850::$$$message_0310_0054_0001$$$::Her house and mine are in opposite directions.[lr]::
36851::$$$message_0310_0054_0002$$$::...Well.[lr]::
36852::$$$message_0310_0054_0003$$$::I have to get back home before dark.::_
