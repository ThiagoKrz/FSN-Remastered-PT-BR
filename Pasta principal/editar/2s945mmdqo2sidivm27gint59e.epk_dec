70521::$$$message_0645_0000_0000$$$::Ahh, you're dead...::
70522::$$$message_0645_0000_0001$$$::Osu. Death by exsanguination + falling. The prognosis is grim.::
70523::$$$message_0645_0000_0002$$$::I think this is obvious, but you died this time because you went to fight on your own.::
70524::$$$message_0645_0000_0003$$$::If you have an opportunity to team up with someone, you should aggressively pursue it for best results.::
70525::$$$message_0645_0000_0004$$$::Huh? So should he have teamed up with like, Caster or Shinji?::
70526::$$$message_0645_0000_0005$$$::Mrgh. You gotta have some standards.[lr]::
70527::$$$message_0645_0000_0006$$$::They didn't have any dialogue choices anyway.::
70528::$$$message_0645_0000_0007$$$::Lazy writer. I wanted to see routes where Shirou teams up with Shinji or Caster.::
70529::$$$message_0645_0000_0008$$$::Eeek! Stop talking about deleted routes! We don't have an unlimited budget or schedule!::
70530::$$$message_0645_0000_0009$$$::A chef knows to put the maximum effort into making the most delicious parts!::
70531::$$$message_0645_0000_0010$$$::Sure, okay. We'll leave it at that.[lr]::
70532::$$$message_0645_0000_0011$$$::So he needs to team up with Kotomine?::
70533::$$$message_0645_0000_0012$$$::Hmm... I guess so.[lr]::
70534::$$$message_0645_0000_0013$$$::I understand why you might not want to work with the priest, but now's the time to set aside personal grudges for a common struggle.::
70535::$$$message_0645_0000_0014$$$::Osu! Roger that![lr]::
70536::$$$message_0645_0000_0015$$$::Yesterday's enemy is today's friend! I read that in my shounen mangas, Master!::
70537::$$$message_0645_0000_0016$$$::Good! All of humanity is brothers! That's a good saying! Use it!::
70538::$$$message_0645_0000_0017$$$::Yeah! Just get rid of your allies once they outlive their usefulness!::
70539::$$$message_0645_0000_0018$$$::Whoa now, that's a little too real.::
