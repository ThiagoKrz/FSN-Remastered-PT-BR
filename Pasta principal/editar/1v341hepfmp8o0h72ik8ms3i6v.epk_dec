63346::$$$message_0583_0000_0000$$$::"I'm coming in, Sakura."[lr]::
63347::$$$message_0583_0000_0001$$$::He opens the door without waiting for a reply.[lr]::
63348::$$$message_0583_0000_0002$$$::He's never waited for his little sister to answer before opening the door.::
63349::$$$message_0583_0001_0000$$$::"What, she still isn't back yet? What am I gonna do with her?"[lr]::
63350::$$$message_0583_0001_0001$$$::He clicks his tongue and steps into the room.[lr]::
63351::$$$message_0583_0001_0002$$$::Shinji Matou paces around his sister's room like a blind dog, running his nails along the walls.::
63352::$$$message_0583_0002_0000$$$::"Sakura. Are you in the basement today, too? What are you doing down there without me?"[lr]::
63353::$$$message_0583_0002_0001$$$::Nobody answers his repeated questions.[lr]::
63354::$$$message_0583_0002_0002$$$::There's no one else in the room.[lr]::
63355::$$$message_0583_0002_0003$$$::His sister hasn't been back home for the last few days.[lr]::
63356::$$$message_0583_0002_0004$$$::Shinji keeps pacing around the room, even though he knows full well that its resident isn't here.::
63357::$$$message_0583_0003_0000$$$::"You're always like that. Haha, you're seriously always like that!"[lr]::
63358::$$$message_0583_0003_0001$$$::He picks up a clock and throws it.[lr]::
63359::$$$message_0583_0003_0002$$$::The sound of the glass breaking irritates him more than he expected.::
63360::$$$message_0583_0004_0000$$$::"Where'd she go? Keeping secrets from her big brother..."[lr]::
63361::$$$message_0583_0004_0001$$$::He keeps throwing things, as if spitting out his anger.[lr]::
63362::$$$message_0583_0004_0002$$$::...That's how this always goes.[lr]::
63363::$$$message_0583_0004_0003$$$::It's how he's compensated on a regular basis for the last few years.[lr]::
63364::$$$message_0583_0004_0004$$$::It's the greatest act of resistance he can do to forgive himself and his sister, ever since learning the truth three years ago.::
63365::$$$message_0583_0005_0000$$$::    When he was born, the Matou bloodline had already outlived its purpose.::
63366::$$$message_0583_0006_0000$$$::Their noble line lost its power, and the Matous were reduced to ordinary people.[lr]::
63367::$$$message_0583_0006_0001$$$::Their only special assets were their knowledge.[lr]::
63368::$$$message_0583_0006_0002$$$::A once great lineage of arcane scholars met its obscure end in the Orient.::
63369::$$$message_0583_0007_0000$$$::He was told those facts, even as a child.[lr]::
63370::$$$message_0583_0007_0001$$$::He was taught the Matous were special, a clan entrusted with miracles.[lr]::
63371::$$$message_0583_0007_0002$$$::Were.[lr]::
63372::$$$message_0583_0007_0003$$$::There were no Matous left who could use magecraft, and they would have to live in society as normal people from now on.::
63373::$$$message_0583_0008_0000$$$::But he didn't think so.[lr]::
63374::$$$message_0583_0008_0001$$$::It's true that without Magic Circuits or whatever they were called, he couldn't perform magecraft on his own.[lr]::
63375::$$$message_0583_0008_0002$$$::He knew that the mages died out with his father's generation, and that he wasn't qualified to inherit the Matou name.[lr]::
63376::$$$message_0583_0008_0003$$$::But the Matous still had records of their miracles.[lr]::
63377::$$$message_0583_0008_0004$$$::Only their bloodline was over. They still had their wealth of knowledge.::
63378::$$$message_0583_0009_0000$$$::    To the boy, that was enough to make him special.[lr]::
63379::$$$message_0583_0009_0001$$$::He wasn't like other people.[lr]::
63380::$$$message_0583_0009_0002$$$::The Matous were a chosen people.[lr]::
63381::$$$message_0583_0009_0003$$$::Their worth hadn't diminished just because they lost their magical power and stopped being mages.[lr]::
63382::$$$message_0583_0009_0004$$$::He was proud to be part of that special family, and would live an exceptional life.[lr]::
63383::$$$message_0583_0009_0005$$$::He might be lacking as a mage, but he was born into a chosen family, that was for sure.::
63384::$$$message_0583_0010_0000$$$::...One day, a new child came into their fold.[lr]::
63385::$$$message_0583_0010_0001$$$::His father said that the girl had no next of kin, so they would be adopting her.[lr]::
63386::$$$message_0583_0010_0002$$$::It was more than ten years ago.[lr]::
63387::$$$message_0583_0010_0003$$$::From that day forward, the girl named Sakura became his little sister.::
63388::$$$message_0583_0011_0000$$$::At first, he didn't like her.[lr]::
63389::$$$message_0583_0011_0001$$$::He didn't want some foreign element to come into their special family.[lr]::
63390::$$$message_0583_0011_0002$$$::But as the days passed, he began to approve of her.[lr]::
63391::$$$message_0583_0011_0003$$$::Sakura was quiet, plain, and little better than a guard dog.[lr]::
63392::$$$message_0583_0011_0004$$$::Trying to be hostile towards her was a waste of time, so he began to dote on her stupidity, to an extent.::
63393::$$$message_0583_0012_0000$$$::He buried himself in books, learned arcane arts that he couldn't perform, and thought of himself as the Matou heir.[lr]::
63394::$$$message_0583_0012_0001$$$::Only he was allowed into the Matou library.[lr]::
63395::$$$message_0583_0012_0002$$$::His sister was adopted, and she would never be chosen as the heir, so she had no right to look at those books.[lr]::
63396::$$$message_0583_0012_0003$$$::Surely, she would live the rest of her life as a normal person, unaware of the Matous' remaining precious knowledge.[lr]::
63397::$$$message_0583_0012_0004$$$::That notion satisfied his arrogance.::
63398::$$$message_0583_0013_0000$$$::Each mage family only has one successor.[lr]::
63399::$$$message_0583_0013_0001$$$::He knew that, so he never had any doubts that his sister would be cast off and raised separately.[lr]::
63400::$$$message_0583_0013_0002$$$::Only one of them could learn magecraft.[lr]::
63401::$$$message_0583_0013_0003$$$::So it was natural that he didn't see her around much.::
63402::$$$message_0583_0014_0000$$$::That's right.[lr]::
63403::$$$message_0583_0014_0001$$$::In fact, he pitied her.[lr]::
63404::$$$message_0583_0014_0002$$$::They lived in the same house and had the same parents, and yet only he was considered special. He felt sorry for his sister who wasn't chosen.[lr]::
63405::$$$message_0583_0014_0003$$$::His haughty attitude was the compassion of one who is superior, and of course, a source of his self-esteem as a reliable big brother.::
63406::$$$message_0583_0015_0000$$$::So, the brother pitied his sister, and treated her with affection.[lr]::
63407::$$$message_0583_0015_0001$$$::His sister never looked him in the eye.[lr]::
63408::$$$message_0583_0015_0002$$$::He figured she felt ashamed of herself, and so he doted on his helpless little sister.[lr]::
63409::$$$message_0583_0015_0003$$$::Until the day he learned the truth.::
63410::$$$message_0583_0016_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
63411::$$$message_0583_0016_0001$$$::That was the only sound he could make when he happened upon that room.::
63412::$$$message_0583_0017_0000$$$::A room he never knew about.[lr]::
63413::$$$message_0583_0017_0001$$$::Wisdom that was never imparted to him.[lr]::
63414::$$$message_0583_0017_0002$$$::And talents he was never born with.[lr]::
63415::$$$message_0583_0017_0003$$$::All of that was here.[lr]::
63416::$$$message_0583_0017_0004$$$::And she was in the middle of the room,[lr]::
63417::$$$message_0583_0017_0005$$$::surrounded by black, squirming things and their scary grandfather.[lr]::
63418::$$$message_0583_0017_0006$$$::His father glanced at him with a look of scorn he'd never seen before, as if he was an intruder.::
63419::$$$message_0583_0018_0000$$$::It was over.[lr]::
63420::$$$message_0583_0018_0001$$$::Everything he'd ever believed, that he'd constructed in his head, was turned upside-down.::
63421::$$$message_0583_0019_0000$$$::He wasn't the special one.[lr]::
63422::$$$message_0583_0019_0001$$$::His sister wasn't being kept away.[lr]::
63423::$$$message_0583_0019_0002$$$::She wasn't the one to feel sorry for.[lr]::
63424::$$$message_0583_0019_0003$$$::He wasn't the one looking down at her out of pity...::
63425::$$$message_0583_0020_0000$$$::His life was transformed.[lr]::
63426::$$$message_0583_0020_0001$$$::Now that his father didn't need to hide it anymore, he began to interact only with the little sister.[lr]::
63427::$$$message_0583_0020_0002$$$::His little sister still wouldn't say anything. She just kept staring at the floor, like always.[lr]::
63428::$$$message_0583_0020_0003$$$::With that same attitude that seemed like she wanted to escape his gaze, she said,[lr]::
63429::$$$message_0583_0020_0004$$$::"...I'm sorry, big brother."[lr]::
63430::$$$message_0583_0020_0005$$$::She said it with the same sympathy that he once directed at her.::
63431::$$$message_0583_0021_0000$$$::"Ha... Haha, ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"::
63432::$$$message_0583_0022_0000$$$::He laughed.[lr]::
63433::$$$message_0583_0022_0001$$$::He guffawed like there was no tomorrow.[lr]::
63434::$$$message_0583_0022_0002$$$::It was so hilarious he wanted to break everything.[lr]::
63435::$$$message_0583_0022_0003$$$::The girl he'd thought of as a plaything was the real master, while he was a clown all along.[lr]::
63436::$$$message_0583_0022_0004$$$::Was he the crazy one, or her?[lr]::
63437::$$$message_0583_0022_0005$$$::Probably both.[lr]::
63438::$$$message_0583_0022_0006$$$::His life shattered, he went back to the house, and realized something.::
63439::$$$message_0583_0023_0000$$$::It wasn't as if the world suddenly got turned around.[lr]::
63440::$$$message_0583_0023_0001$$$::His environment was always this way.[lr]::
63441::$$$message_0583_0023_0002$$$::The only one who had it backwards, who misunderstood, was himself.[lr]::
63442::$$$message_0583_0023_0003$$$::He realized how wretched he was. He had it all wrong from the beginning.::
63443::$$$message_0583_0024_0000$$$::The next three years were nothing but pain for him.[lr]::
63444::$$$message_0583_0024_0001$$$::His father died, and his grandfather only paid attention to his sister.[lr]::
63445::$$$message_0583_0024_0002$$$::Shinji Matou was no different from the air inside the mansion.[lr]::
63446::$$$message_0583_0024_0003$$$::He was treated like it didn't matter whether he was there or not, and in fact, that's all he was worth.::
63447::$$$message_0583_0025_0000$$$::And she sympathized with him.[lr]::
63448::$$$message_0583_0025_0001$$$::She said, "sorry."[lr]::
63449::$$$message_0583_0025_0002$$$::She didn't necessarily say it out loud, but she apologized every time they saw each other.[lr]::
63450::$$$message_0583_0025_0003$$$::She apologized for taking Shinji Matou's place.::
63451::$$$message_0583_0026_0000$$$::                                           "What're you apologizing for?"::
63452::$$$message_0583_0027_0000$$$::She should have just ignored him.[lr]::
63453::$$$message_0583_0027_0001$$$::Then he would have lost his dignity, and he wouldn't feel any hope.[lr]::
63454::$$$message_0583_0027_0002$$$::Sakura would apologize.[lr]::
63455::$$$message_0583_0027_0003$$$::That only made him feel like there was no outlet for everything he was feeling.::
63456::$$$message_0583_0028_0000$$$::             "I'm your kind big brother."[lr]::
63457::$$$message_0583_0028_0001$$$::             "Your one and only brother you can count on more than anyone else."::
63458::$$$message_0583_0029_0000$$$::In light of his humiliation, surely there was nothing wrong with him treating her this way.::
63459::$$$message_0583_0030_0000$$$::"Ha... Is she still at Emiya's place?[lr]::
63460::$$$message_0583_0030_0001$$$::You're the family heir. Our heir! The great successor to the Matou line!"::
63461::$$$message_0583_0031_0000$$$::The room shows no signs of being lived in.[lr]::
63462::$$$message_0583_0031_0001$$$::That went without saying.[lr]::
63463::$$$message_0583_0031_0002$$$::To Sakura Matou, her only "bedroom" was that underground nest, while this room was just for appearances.[lr]::
63464::$$$message_0583_0031_0003$$$::She wouldn't care no matter how much he messed up the room or how many things he broke.[lr]::
63465::$$$message_0583_0031_0004$$$::It won't change the fact that her name is the one on the door.::
63466::$$$message_0583_0032_0000$$$::Argh, and you're still gonna apologize to me! It's always 'sorry' with you! If you're really sorry, then do what I tell you! You feel guilty? I don't care. If you think of yourself as a Matou at all, then you should be a good little sister and do what your brother says![lr]::
63467::$$$message_0583_0032_0001$$$::He tears off the bedsheets.[lr]::
63468::$$$message_0583_0032_0002$$$::She belonged to him.[lr]::
63469::$$$message_0583_0032_0003$$$::She never defied him, never thought for herself. She just lived here, so why did she leave him now?::
63470::$$$message_0583_0033_0000$$$::"You...you took her from me, Emiya."[lr]::
63471::$$$message_0583_0033_0001$$$::That was a miscalculation on his part.[lr]::
63472::$$$message_0583_0033_0002$$$::He knew that she was attracted to Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
63473::$$$message_0583_0033_0003$$$::Before they met, she never had any interests, but she started to think like a human being once she met Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
63474::$$$message_0583_0033_0004$$$::Then, she gradually recovered her personality, until she left Shinji.::
63475::$$$message_0583_0034_0000$$$::After all the trouble he went through to act like a nice older brother, how could she go with that stranger Shirou Emiya, and not him...!?::
63476::$$$message_0583_0035_0000$$$::"I told them so. I said that she shouldn't go to his house, but that geezer said some crap about keeping an eye on the Emiyas!"[lr]::
63477::$$$message_0583_0035_0001$$$::Their grandfather never made any effort to bring Sakura home after giving the order.[lr]::
63478::$$$message_0583_0035_0002$$$::He just said to let her be, and even warned Shinji to restrain himself.::
63479::$$$message_0583_0036_0000$$$::"Just you watch. I'll pay you back for this, Emiya. I'll rip you apart while Sakura watches..."[lr]::
63480::$$$message_0583_0036_0001$$$::...That's right.[lr]::
63481::$$$message_0583_0036_0002$$$::If Sakura was going to leave him, then he'd just force her back into their old relationship.[lr]::
63482::$$$message_0583_0036_0003$$$::If she was going to leave the Matou family for [font italic=true]him[font italic=false]...::
63483::$$$message_0583_0037_0000$$$::"...Then we can just go back to being the way we used to be."[lr]::
63484::$$$message_0583_0037_0001$$$::He cackles.[lr]::
63485::$$$message_0583_0037_0002$$$::His reflection in the cloudy window is as ghastly as a skull.::
