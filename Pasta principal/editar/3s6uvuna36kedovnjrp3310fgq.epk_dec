37512::$$$message_0322_0000_0000$$$::"I'm going to go talk to Saber. I don't know what's up, but is it okay to leave you in charge of dinner?"[lr]::
37513::$$$message_0322_0000_0001$$$::"Yup. I'll make you delicious crab egg foo young, so look forward to it."::
37514::$$$message_0322_0001_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
37515::$$$message_0322_0001_0001$$$::I'm a bit worried, but crab egg foo young is like an advanced version of an omelet, so even Fuji-nee should be able to handle it.::
37516::$$$message_0322_0002_0000$$$::"I just got home, Saber."[lr]::
37517::$$$message_0322_0002_0001$$$::I take my shoes off as I enter the dojo.::
37518::$$$message_0322_0003_0000$$$::"...Welcome back, Shirou. It would appear that nothing out of the ordinary happened today."[lr]::
37519::$$$message_0322_0003_0001$$$::Saber must feel relaxed in this atmosphere, as she seems to favor the dojo.::
37520::$$$message_0322_0004_0000$$$::I kneel to sit and match Saber and tell her about what happened today. How we eliminated the Bounded Field at school, and how Tohsaka anticipates that there'll be some kind of counterattack tomorrow.::
37521::$$$message_0322_0005_0000$$$::"...I see. So our battle with an enemy Master is tomorrow? Then I shall get plenty of rest tonight and save my energy."::
37522::$$$message_0322_0006_0000$$$::I agree.[lr]::
37523::$$$message_0322_0006_0001$$$::...I know it's probably naïve, but I didn't tell her about Shinji.[lr]::
37524::$$$message_0322_0006_0002$$$::I don't want her to consider him an enemy until his true intentions are clear.::
37525::$$$message_0322_0007_0000$$$::"However, Shirou. Is it fine for you to be here when it is almost time for dinner?"[lr]::
37526::$$$message_0322_0007_0001$$$::"Mm? Well, it's not like I have anything in particular to do, so I came to report to you since I have time until dinner.[lr]::
37527::$$$message_0322_0007_0002$$$::It's not bad to relax before a meal once in a while."::
37528::$$$message_0322_0008_0000$$$::"Wha... Then you are not making dinner tonight...!?"[lr]::
37529::$$$message_0322_0008_0001$$$::"Huh... N-no, is there a problem? Fuji-nee's working hard, so I don't want to interrupt her."::
37530::$$$message_0322_0009_0000$$$::"...Hmm... We should certainly respect her willingness, but... Um, will you really not be helping her...?"::
37531::$$$message_0322_0010_0000$$$::"Nope. It's all right, Fuji-nee is an adult, so she should be able to make some egg foo young.[lr]::
37532::$$$message_0322_0010_0001$$$::Well, she might be even better than me. She has an A-rank in unexpectedness after all."::
37533::$$$message_0322_0011_0000$$$::Admittedly, my explanation might be strange.[lr]::
37534::$$$message_0322_0011_0001$$$::And Saber is still frowning.[lr]::
37535::$$$message_0322_0011_0002$$$::"...Understood. I shall believe your words over Taiga's.[lr]::
37536::$$$message_0322_0011_0003$$$::...Allow me to make sure. I can trust you, right, Shirou?"[lr]::
37537::$$$message_0322_0011_0004$$$::She makes sure with an intimidating intensity.::
37538::$$$message_0322_0012_0000$$$::"Y-yeah. You can trust me."[lr]::
37539::$$$message_0322_0012_0001$$$::"...I heard that. Please do not forget the oath you made."[lr]::
37540::$$$message_0322_0012_0002$$$::That must've been enough, as she relaxes her shoulders.::
37541::$$$message_0322_0013_0000$$$::...Man.[lr]::
37542::$$$message_0322_0013_0001$$$::Who would've imagined that this would become the cause of such a disaster...?::
