17123::$$$message_0158_0000_0000$$$::"Nope. We're going to fast today."[lr]::
17124::$$$message_0158_0000_0001$$$::They say that when an army runs out of provisions, they tend to find themselves backed into a corner.[lr]::
17125::$$$message_0158_0000_0002$$$::With no time to think...I find myself just blurting that out.::
17126::$$$message_0158_0001_0000$$$::"Shirou? Um...what does that mean?"::
17127::$$$message_0158_0002_0000$$$::"Was it confusing?[lr]::
17128::$$$message_0158_0002_0001$$$::What I'm trying to say is that we're not going to have lunch today. We had a hearty breakfast of hamburg steak this morning, so I thought we could skip lunch."::
17129::$$$message_0158_0003_0000$$$::I'm not sure what drove me to say that, but honestly? I'm not hungry right now anyway.[lr]::
17130::$$$message_0158_0003_0001$$$::I'm taking the time to spar with Saber, so I want to keep training.::
17131::$$$message_0158_0004_0000$$$::"So let's keep training. Come on, pick up your shinai, Saber."[lr]::
17132::$$$message_0158_0004_0001$$$::I point the tip of my shinai at Saber.::
17133::$$$message_0158_0005_0000$$$::"P-please wait, Shirou! This conversation is going nowhere![lr]::
17134::$$$message_0158_0005_0001$$$::There is no sense in saying we should not eat lunch just because we had a large breakfast!"::
17135::$$$message_0158_0006_0000$$$::"Eh...What!? Wh-what are you doing, Saber!? Give the shinai back!"[lr]::
17136::$$$message_0158_0006_0001$$$::"I will not! There is not much time! As your Servant, I demand my Master start preparing our meal right this instant!"::
17137::$$$message_0158_0007_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
17138::$$$message_0158_0007_0001$$$::Hold on a minute.[lr]::
17139::$$$message_0158_0007_0002$$$::Saber can be a little weird, but today she's going overboard.::
17140::$$$message_0158_0008_0000$$$::"Saber. What do you mean, there's not much time? Do you have plans?"[lr]::
17141::$$$message_0158_0008_0001$$$::"I do not. Which is why I am saying we should have lunch."[lr]::
17142::$$$message_0158_0008_0002$$$::"Yeah but, I just said we're skipping lunch..."::
17143::$$$message_0158_0009_0000$$$::"Which is ridiculous. Do you still not understand, even after me repeatedly saying so!?[lr]::
17144::$$$message_0158_0009_0001$$$::I will say it this one, last time, Shirou. Please make lunch right now!"::
17145::$$$message_0158_0010_0000$$$::"Ugh...huh!?"[lr]::
17146::$$$message_0158_0010_0001$$$::Saber protests so intensely, I think she might jump at me right now.[lr]::
17147::$$$message_0158_0010_0002$$$::Just when I was about to agree, unused to seeing her like this as I am...::
17148::$$$message_0158_0011_0000$$$::"Oh, I hear a stomach growling."[lr]::
17149::$$$message_0158_0011_0001$$$::Saber's stomach growls, giving the usual signal of her hunger.::
17150::$$$message_0158_0012_0000$$$::"Was that Saber? Are you really that hungry?"[lr]::
17151::$$$message_0158_0012_0001$$$::"N-no. I am not especially hungry, but it appears my body requires nutrients."::
17152::$$$message_0158_0013_0000$$$::"Huh. I guess that happens when you move around a bunch, but Saber...how disgraceful. You may be a mere Servant, but if you forget your manners entirely, Shirou might end up hating you."::
17153::$$$message_0158_0014_0000$$$::"Th-that is untrue! I am a Servant, so the only way I could disappoint Shirou is by being defeated!"::
17154::$$$message_0158_0015_0000$$$::"Um...I'm not going to be disappointed because you lost, but that doesn't mean there aren't other things you can do that might seem odd, Saber."::
17155::$$$message_0158_0016_0000$$$::"THAT. IS. ALL! Besides, my stomach growling because I am hungry is only proof that my body is functioning properly! If that annoys you, then blame Shirou for failing to feed me!"[lr]::
17156::$$$message_0158_0016_0001$$$::Saber glares at Illya, who then glares at me since, according to Saber, I'm the problem here.::
17157::$$$message_0158_0017_0000$$$::Also, the stomach growling is the result of a gastrointestinal response called hunger pangs.[lr]::
17158::$$$message_0158_0017_0001$$$::The stomach is constantly expanding and contracting, and this movement becomes more intense when the stomach is empty. The contraction of the stomach compresses the air inside it, which makes the sound we're familiar with.[lr]::
17159::$$$message_0158_0017_0002$$$::On the other hand, the stomach is also affected by the autonomic nerves as well.::
17160::$$$message_0158_0018_0000$$$::It is constantly moving, which means the stomach doesn't only rumble when it's empty.[lr]::
17161::$$$message_0158_0018_0001$$$::The stomach's movements...the cause of it rumbling so loudly is...[lr]::
17162::$$$message_0158_0018_0002$$$::[font italic=true]"I'm hungry. My stomach's about to rumble. People will know I'm hungry if they hear it. So I need to hold it in."[font italic=false][r]::
17163::$$$message_0158_0018_0003$$$::Such thoughts make the person tense up, which causes their stomach to contract even more.::
17164::$$$message_0158_0019_0000$$$::Hmmm...[lr]::
17165::$$$message_0158_0019_0001$$$::In other words...::
17166::$$$message_0158_0020_0000$$$::"Ha. I get it. You were just mad because you were hungry. That's why you were all moody. Seriously, I can't believe you're still hungry even after such a big meal this morning. You glutton, you."[lr]::
17167::$$$message_0158_0020_0001$$$::"Wha...!?"::
17168::$$$message_0158_0021_0000$$$::"Oooh. Now that you mention it, I didn't notice because she was all quiet, but she ate twice as much as Rin. I didn't know Saber was such a glutton!"::
17169::$$$message_0158_0022_0000$$$::"That is not true. I am not a glutton... Rin is just a light eater! Shirou, surely you understand[line2]"::
17170::$$$message_0158_0023_0000$$$::"Hmmm, I guess you're right. I've noticed she always eats until the very end. I think if she really worked at it, she could eat just as much as Fuji-nee."[lr]::
17171::$$$message_0158_0023_0001$$$::"That is absolutely not true! What have you been watching all this time, Shirou!?"::
17172::$$$message_0158_0024_0000$$$::"Eh...? Well, I'm just being honest...[lr]::
17173::$$$message_0158_0024_0001$$$::Besides, your stomach always rumbles around this time. Glutton or not, I think you just get hungry fast."[lr]::
17174::$$$message_0158_0024_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
17175::$$$message_0158_0024_0003$$$::"I knew it! Saber, you're so immodest!"::
17176::$$$message_0158_0025_0000$$$::Illya leaps up joyfully, excited to dress Saber down.::
17177::$$$message_0158_0026_0000$$$::Saber, on the other hand, who had been completely distraught earlier...[lr]::
17178::$$$message_0158_0026_0001$$$::...is back to her usual self, like nothing happened.::
17179::$$$message_0158_0027_0000$$$::"Saber? Um...aren't you...mad?"[lr]::
17180::$$$message_0158_0027_0001$$$::"I am not angry. As Illyasviel mentioned, I have been consuming a great deal of food.[lr]::
17181::$$$message_0158_0027_0002$$$::I may have been pushing myself a bit in order to keep my stamin[line2]that is, magical energy reserves high to reduce the burden on Shirou."::
17182::$$$message_0158_0028_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
17183::$$$message_0158_0028_0001$$$::Oh right.[lr]::
17184::$$$message_0158_0028_0002$$$::Saber can only replenish magical energy on her own.[lr]::
17185::$$$message_0158_0028_0003$$$::She sleeps to reduce her consumption of magical energy.[lr]::
17186::$$$message_0158_0028_0004$$$::And she probably wanted to stockpile as much energy by eating food.::
17187::$$$message_0158_0029_0000$$$::"Sorry I wasn't exactly being considerate.[lr]::
17188::$$$message_0158_0029_0001$$$::Even though we formed a connection, that doesn't give you everything you need."::
17189::$$$message_0158_0030_0000$$$::And she requires tens of times more magical energy than I can give. Maybe more.[lr]::
17190::$$$message_0158_0030_0001$$$::Servants consume massive amounts of magical energy just to keep existing.[lr]::
17191::$$$message_0158_0030_0002$$$::But the amount of magical energy Saber can generate in a day doesn't cover all she needs just to exist.::
17192::$$$message_0158_0031_0000$$$::"It is all right, as long as you understand. But more importantly, Shirou..."[lr]::
17193::$$$message_0158_0031_0001$$$::"Yeah, I know. I actually made lunch already. We're having bento today, so we can eat them right[line2]"[lr]::
17194::$$$message_0158_0031_0002$$$::"No. We should take this time to train a bit more."::
17195::$$$message_0158_0032_0000$$$::Oh?[lr]::
17196::$$$message_0158_0032_0001$$$::Saber gives me back my shinai and takes a ready position to start a match.::
17197::$$$message_0158_0033_0000$$$::"Saber...? I thought we were going to eat..."[lr]::
17198::$$$message_0158_0033_0001$$$::"That will not be necessary. You mentioned you would rather do this, so..."::
17199::$$$message_0158_0034_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
17200::$$$message_0158_0034_0001$$$::A chill runs down my spine. I realize I've made a terrible mistake.::
17201::$$$message_0158_0035_0000$$$::"Wait. Wait, please. Let's calm down.[lr]::
17202::$$$message_0158_0035_0001$$$::...Saber, you're... You're really mad, aren't you?"[lr]::
17203::$$$message_0158_0035_0002$$$::I realize how timid I sound.::
17204::$$$message_0158_0036_0000$$$::"Of course not. Is there something in my behavior that suggests otherwise to you?"[lr]::
17205::$$$message_0158_0036_0001$$$::"You're absolutely different! You even changed outfits!"::
17206::$$$message_0158_0037_0000$$$::Her armor!?[lr]::
17207::$$$message_0158_0037_0001$$$::Is she wielding the shinai while fully armored!?[lr]::
17208::$$$message_0158_0037_0002$$$::She is!::
17209::$$$message_0158_0038_0000$$$::"We shall continue with light training, as usual."[lr]::
17210::$$$message_0158_0038_0001$$$::"A-are you serious? Don't you think this is a little immature of you!?"::
17211::$$$message_0158_0039_0000$$$::She isn't listening.[lr]::
17212::$$$message_0158_0039_0001$$$::I'm hit with all the force of a lightning strike.[lr]::
17213::$$$message_0158_0039_0002$$$::Freed from her position as an educator, Saber truly bares her claws.::
17214::$$$message_0158_0040_0000$$$::Hello there![lr]::
17215::$$$message_0158_0040_0001$$$::This is Tiger Dojo, the spiritual world which lifts those who died of minor misunderstandings up to heaven!::
17216::$$$message_0158_0040_0002$$$::And I'm the assistant, Angel of the Afterlife Number One.::
17217::$$$message_0158_0040_0003$$$::Know this: you must live every second of your life cautiously, or your wounds will last a lifetime.[lr]::
17218::$$$message_0158_0040_0004$$$::If you make fun of someone with no sense of humor, you should brace for death.::
17219::$$$message_0158_0040_0005$$$::Looks like it. But Shirou looked so cute when Saber's one strike sent his soul fleeing his body.::
17220::$$$message_0158_0040_0006$$$::...This kid has a twisted idea of what's cute.[lr]::
17221::$$$message_0158_0040_0007$$$::Though, actually, this corpse is in remarkably good shape. Isn't it rare for him to be in such good shape?::
17222::$$$message_0158_0040_0008$$$::You're right. It's somewhat anticlimactic.::
17223::$$$message_0158_0040_0009$$$::...Wanna mess with it?::
17224::$$$message_0158_0040_0010$$$::...Let's do it.::
17225::$$$message_0158_0040_0011$$$::Okay! Time to begin our alterations! First, to prevent the body from being revived by mistake, we're going to turn both hands into Gatling guns!::
17226::$$$message_0158_0040_0012$$$::Sir, yes sir!::
17227::$$$message_0158_0040_0013$$$::Okay! And we're done!::
17228::$$$message_0158_0040_0014$$$::What do you think? How's it feel getting your whole body modified?[lr]::
17229::$$$message_0158_0040_0015$$$::We did at least respect your wishes and not operate on your brain, which would have been the final modification!::
17230::$$$message_0158_0040_0016$$$::We stopped!::
17231::$$$message_0158_0040_0017$$$::Now, you must choose between joining the Tiger's Angels, or being brainwashed and made into a machine! Your choice!::
17232::$$$message_0158_0040_0018$$$::Th-this is bad, supreme ruler! The experiment is using his modded powers to escape its bonds!::
17233::$$$message_0158_0040_0019$$$::Kyaaah! He's gone berserk! He'll destroy our base![lr]::
17234::$$$message_0158_0040_0020$$$::W-we may have created our own greatest enemy!::
17235::$$$message_0158_0041_0000$$$::What have we dooone!?[lr]::
17236::$$$message_0158_0041_0001$$$::We should have started with his brain!::
17237::$$$message_0158_0041_0002$$$::Kyaaah! I think people normally start with the brain!::
17238::$$$message_0158_0042_0000$$$::"Huh...!?"[lr]::
17239::$$$message_0158_0042_0001$$$::I just had the craziest dream... Could that have been the afterlife?::
17240::$$$message_0158_0043_0000$$$::"Have you come to, Shirou? I am ashamed that, after all this practice, you cannot even dodge a single blow from me.[lr]::
17241::$$$message_0158_0043_0001$$$::So please dodge this next one. I am using kendo techniques, so you should be able to endure this, so long as you properly brace yourself."::
17242::$$$message_0158_0044_0000$$$::"N-n-n-n-no! You still want to keep going!?"[lr]::
17243::$$$message_0158_0044_0001$$$::"Of course. We still have ten minutes until noon. Let us keep going until we reach our limit, as usual."[lr]::
17244::$$$message_0158_0044_0002$$$::Saber's shinai strikes furiously, with a loud, cracking sound.::
17245::$$$message_0158_0045_0000$$$::"Agh... Oof."[lr]::
17246::$$$message_0158_0045_0001$$$::I pass out once again.[lr]::
17247::$$$message_0158_0045_0002$$$::...I should be more careful.[lr]::
17248::$$$message_0158_0045_0003$$$::Saber is the sort to really devote herself to taking revenge if you make her angry.Öý“8
