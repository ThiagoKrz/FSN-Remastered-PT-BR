36649::$$$message_0308_0000_0000$$$::...I'll try asking him.[lr]::
36650::$$$message_0308_0000_0001$$$::She's not one to reveal herself even to Issei, but I might be able to get some clues. Issei does live at the temple.::
36651::$$$message_0308_0001_0000$$$::"Issei. What kind of person is that woman?[lr]::
36652::$$$message_0308_0001_0001$$$::Is she from a foreign country? Does she always hide her appearance behind a turban-like cloth?"::
36653::$$$message_0308_0002_0000$$$::"What is that? We would have kicked such a suspicious person out... I don't know why you're asking, but she is a legitimate guest.[lr]::
36654::$$$message_0308_0002_0001$$$::...My brother entertains the idea that she's some servant of evil, but I rather like her. I've only spoken with her once, but she is a fair person, though she seems a little foul."::
36655::$$$message_0308_0003_0000$$$::"Oh, wow. It was worth asking this question, that's rare for you to praise a woman. What, did you fall in love?"::
36656::$$$message_0308_0004_0000$$$::"D-d-don't be ridiculous, fool! What I admire was that she doesn't look at herself. First of all, I can't fall in love with the lover of Souichirou, the one I look up to like a brother..."::
36657::$$$message_0308_0005_0000$$$::Issei suddenly stops talking and lowers his face.[lr]::
36658::$$$message_0308_0005_0001$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
36659::$$$message_0308_0005_0002$$$::He might've felt dizzy, as he falls face down on the table and doesn't move.::
36660::$$$message_0308_0006_0000$$$::"Mm? What happened, Issei? Is it anemia?"[lr]::
36661::$$$message_0308_0006_0001$$$::"...No, it's not that I feel bad."::
36662::$$$message_0308_0007_0000$$$::He lifts himself suddenly.[lr]::
36663::$$$message_0308_0007_0001$$$::I laugh, picturing him like a wind-up doll, suddenly full of energy.::
36664::$$$message_0308_0008_0000$$$::"...Issei?"[lr]::
36665::$$$message_0308_0008_0001$$$::I don't even look at my slashed stomach. My eyes go to the knife in Issei's hand.::
36666::$$$message_0308_0009_0000$$$::"You fell for my trap. The command that I have implanted in this human is activated only when he comes across someone that inquires about me."::
36667::$$$message_0308_0010_0000$$$::A voice that doesn't belong to Issei, comes out of his mouth.[lr]::
36668::$$$message_0308_0010_0001$$$::When I realize it's the voice of the Servant I met at Ryudou Temple...[lr]::
36669::$$$message_0308_0010_0002$$$::"I do not need this doll anymore, either."[lr]::
36670::$$$message_0308_0010_0003$$$::...It's like I'm looking in a mirror.::
36671::$$$message_0308_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36672::$$$message_0308_0011_0001$$$::...My consciousness fades from the blood loss.[lr]::
36673::$$$message_0308_0011_0002$$$::The wound. The pain from the wound reaching my organs isn't causing my consciousness to fade.::
36674::$$$message_0308_0012_0000$$$::Instead of death from blood loss, eager to deny the sight before me, my mind rapidly freezes my consciousness.[lr]::
36675::$$$message_0308_0012_0001$$$::Issei falls down before me, without knowing what's going on.::
36676::$$$message_0308_0013_0000$$$::...I collapse onto the floor from my knees.[lr]::
36677::$$$message_0308_0013_0001$$$::I don't even press on my own wound, and I stare blankly at the face of my friend who is now just a corpse...:éÍÙ
