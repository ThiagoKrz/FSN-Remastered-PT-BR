32119::$$$message_0259_0000_0001$$$::I couldn't do anything, even if I wanted to. I know that.[lr]::
32120::$$$message_0259_0000_0002$$$::But even now...I can still feel her hand in mine.[lr]::
32121::$$$message_0259_0000_0003$$$::I told her we should do our best.[lr]::
32122::$$$message_0259_0000_0004$$$::She shook my hand when I offered it.[lr]::
32123::$$$message_0259_0000_0005$$$::So...::
32124::$$$message_0259_0001_0000$$$::"Agh, well isn't that obvious...!!"[lr]::
32125::$$$message_0259_0001_0001$$$::If I climb up this hill and chase after the giant, I'll be killed.[lr]::
32126::$$$message_0259_0001_0002$$$::I suppress a tremble and sprint up the hill as fast as I can.::
32127::$$$message_0259_0002_0000$$$::"Saber...!"[lr]::
32128::$$$message_0259_0002_0001$$$::I run into the barren land.[lr]::
32129::$$$message_0259_0002_0002$$$::...And then.[lr]::
32130::$$$message_0259_0002_0003$$$::What I see defies all expectation.::
32131::$$$message_0259_0003_0000$$$::A tombstone goes flying.[lr]::
32132::$$$message_0259_0003_0001$$$::Every time the giant roars and swings his massive sword, he splits tombstones in two.[lr]::
32133::$$$message_0259_0003_0002$$$::   In the midst of that...[lr]::
32134::$$$message_0259_0003_0003$$$::...a knight dashes, undaunted, through the storm of tombstones.::
32135::$$$message_0259_0004_0000$$$::That monstrous cleaver weaves a raging storm around the giant.[lr]::
32136::$$$message_0259_0004_0001$$$::Tombstones crash together in a deafening cacophony.[lr]::
32137::$$$message_0259_0004_0002$$$::In the center of that storm, Saber fights Berserker, matching his power[line2]if not exceeding it.::
32138::$$$message_0259_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32139::$$$message_0259_0005_0001$$$::"[wacky len=9]"[lr]::
32140::$$$message_0259_0005_0002$$$::Their positions have reversed.[lr]::
32141::$$$message_0259_0005_0003$$$::She's using her much smaller size to her advantage.[lr]::
32142::$$$message_0259_0005_0004$$$::Berserker is so large that he's hindered by all the obstacles around them.[lr]::
32143::$$$message_0259_0005_0005$$$::Saber is able to move around freely, darting between them.::
32144::$$$message_0259_0006_0000$$$::These obstacles are trivial to something as strong as Berserker...[lr]::
32145::$$$message_0259_0006_0001$$$::...but it's more than nothing.[lr]::
32146::$$$message_0259_0006_0002$$$::It's a small advantage, but in a battle like this, even that small advantage is tipping the balance in the other direction now[line2]::
32147::$$$message_0259_0007_0000$$$::"Over here...! You're in the way!"[lr]::
32148::$$$message_0259_0007_0001$$$::"Huh? Woah...!?"[lr]::
32149::$$$message_0259_0007_0002$$$::"What are you thinking!? Didn't I tell you to run? Are you deaf?"[lr]::
32150::$$$message_0259_0007_0003$$$::She is absolutely fuming.::
32151::$$$message_0259_0008_0000$$$::"I...heard you, but I can't just run away, right?"::
32152::$$$message_0259_0009_0000$$$::"What!? How did you figure that!? Don't you get it? You can't fight! You're just in the way here! If you died trying to make a difference,[se file=se275 nowait=true][quake time=1000 vmax=15 hmax=10] well, that happens. But if you're killed before you can even do anything, you'll be dying in vain!"::
32153::$$$message_0259_0010_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
32154::$$$message_0259_0010_0001$$$::...I don't know why, but Tohsaka is furious.[lr]::
32155::$$$message_0259_0010_0002$$$::Weirdly, I'm not upset about how she's yelling at me.::
32156::$$$message_0259_0011_0000$$$::"Hey. Is that really something for you to get mad about? If I die, even in vain, it's not really your problem, is it, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
32157::$$$message_0259_0011_0001$$$::"It has everything to do with me! It bothers [font italic=true]me[font italic=false] if you don't get home safely even when I'm letting you go for the day!"::
32158::$$$message_0259_0012_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
32159::$$$message_0259_0012_0001$$$::...And now I'm even more confused.[lr]::
32160::$$$message_0259_0012_0002$$$::Tohsaka really puts up a front at school.::
32161::$$$message_0259_0013_0000$$$::"Geez. Anyway, you're not hurt, so just run away."[lr]::
32162::$$$message_0259_0013_0001$$$::...That llyasviel brat really does seem to be planning to kill us all."::
32163::$$$message_0259_0014_0000$$$::"I know that. But I'm not running away. Saber is still fighting, and I won't leave her."::
32164::$$$message_0259_0015_0000$$$::"...That's what an experienced Master should say. The problem is, you're going to die in vain since you can't do anything to support her.[lr]::
32165::$$$message_0259_0015_0001$$$::This is your last chance. Go on now."[lr]::
32166::$$$message_0259_0015_0002$$$::"No way. There has to be something I can do as long as I'm alive. Plus, Tohsaka, would you make someone else do something you can't?"::
32167::$$$message_0259_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32168::$$$message_0259_0016_0001$$$::Tohsaka stares at me, her expression serious.[lr]::
32169::$$$message_0259_0016_0002$$$::"...You're right. It was wrong of me to force something I can't do onto you."::
32170::$$$message_0259_0017_0000$$$::She looks away.[lr]::
32171::$$$message_0259_0017_0001$$$::"...Well, you might not even need to run away. It doesn't look like Saber's going to lose now."[lr]::
32172::$$$message_0259_0017_0002$$$::Tohsaka peers at the cemetery from behind a tree.::
32173::$$$message_0259_0018_0000$$$::Their battle continues, unchanged.[lr]::
32174::$$$message_0259_0018_0001$$$::Berserker's attacks slash only empty air, tearing apart his surroundings like a tornado.::
32175::$$$message_0259_0019_0000$$$::Between those attacks...[lr]::
32176::$$$message_0259_0019_0001$$$::...within the swirling whirlwind and flying clods...[lr]::
32177::$$$message_0259_0019_0002$$$::...and rain of broken tombstones...[lr]::
32178::$$$message_0259_0019_0003$$$::Saber steps in closer to Berserker and attacks, without even scratching her armor.::
32179::$$$message_0259_0020_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
32180::$$$message_0259_0020_0001$$$::This is...divine. Like nothing I've ever seen.[lr]::
32181::$$$message_0259_0020_0002$$$::After witnessing a battle that is nearly impossible for humans, the fear I felt until just now disappears.[lr]::
32182::$$$message_0259_0020_0003$$$::In fact, I'm fascinated.::
32183::$$$message_0259_0021_0000$$$::The whole thing about the Holy Grail War hadn't really sunk in yet, and I was so anxious.[lr]::
32184::$$$message_0259_0021_0001$$$::But after seeing her? All that just...fades away.::
32185::$$$message_0259_0022_0000$$$::Swords dance around each other in violent, brutal arcs.[lr]::
32186::$$$message_0259_0022_0001$$$::At the center of that whirlwind of fatal destruction, the knight challenges her enemy without hesitation.::
32187::$$$message_0259_0023_0000$$$::Maybe this is what made me accept it all.[lr]::
32188::$$$message_0259_0023_0001$$$::No matter what may wait in the future...[lr]::
32189::$$$message_0259_0023_0002$$$::...with Saber at my side, I could fight even a god.::
32190::$$$message_0259_0024_0000$$$::"...I thought so. I thought it was suspicious, but she blocked Berserker's sword on purpose."[lr]::
32191::$$$message_0259_0024_0001$$$::Quietly...[lr]::
32192::$$$message_0259_0024_0002$$$::Tohsaka mutters without emotion.::
32193::$$$message_0259_0025_0000$$$::"...Was that to lure Berserker here?"[lr]::
32194::$$$message_0259_0025_0001$$$::"Figured it out too, huh. Fighting that thing in the open, with no cover, is suicide. So Saber chose this place as [se file=se275 nowait=true][quake time=1000 vmax=15 hmax=8]their battlefield. She did it cleverly, too, drawing Berserker away from you while pretending to be on the back foot."::
32195::$$$message_0259_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32196::$$$message_0259_0026_0001$$$::...That would mean...[lr]::
32197::$$$message_0259_0026_0002$$$::Saber must have decided this was a good place to fight as far back as when we were walking down the hill.::
32198::$$$message_0259_0027_0000$$$::"Certainly, you can't expect backup in a battle like this.[lr]::
32199::$$$message_0259_0027_0001$$$::But this monster nullifies even Archer's arrows.[lr]::
32200::$$$message_0259_0027_0002$$$::Backup would've been meaningless in the first place."[lr]::
32201::$$$message_0259_0027_0003$$$::Tohsaka mutters while watching the battle[se file=se275 nowait=true][quake time=1000 vmax=15 hmax=8] between Saber and Berserker.::
32202::$$$message_0259_0028_0000$$$::"...Archer's arrows..."[lr]::
32203::$$$message_0259_0028_0001$$$::Those words get my attention.[lr]::
32204::$$$message_0259_0028_0002$$$::Archer is nowhere to be seen.[lr]::
32205::$$$message_0259_0028_0003$$$::If he is a bowman as his name suggests, then close combat probably isn't his thing, but...::
32206::$$$message_0259_0029_0000$$$::"She got him...!"[lr]::
32207::$$$message_0259_0029_0001$$$::Tohsaka snaps her fingers.[lr]::
32208::$$$message_0259_0029_0002$$$::Just as she said, either Saber must have struck Berserker, or he must have lost his footing...[lr]::
32209::$$$message_0259_0029_0003$$$::Berserker, who hadn't so much as faltered until now, loses his balance.::
32210::$$$message_0259_0030_0000$$$::"[wacky len=9]"[lr]::
32211::$$$message_0259_0030_0001$$$::He unleashes a wild attack in desperation.[lr]::
32212::$$$message_0259_0030_0002$$$::Saber dodges backward and grips her sword with both hands.::
32213::$$$message_0259_0031_0000$$$::...This is it.[lr]::
32214::$$$message_0259_0031_0001$$$::As his desperate attack is dodged, Berserker loses his bal[se file=se275 nowait=true][quake time=1000 vmax=20 hmax=10]ance completely...[lr]::
32215::$$$message_0259_0031_0002$$$::...and Saber bends her knees to rush in with all her might.::
32216::$$$message_0259_0032_0000$$$::Then...[lr]::
32217::$$$message_0259_0032_0001$$$::"...Huh, Archer...? What do you mean 'get away'?"[lr]::
32218::$$$message_0259_0032_0002$$$::I notice the confusion in Tohsaka's voice as she tilts her head. Then I sense the lethal intent aimed in this direction...from far away.::
32219::$$$message_0259_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32220::$$$message_0259_0033_0001$$$::From behind.[lr]::
32221::$$$message_0259_0033_0002$$$::I see a knight in red holding a bow on a rooftop hundreds of meters away.::
32222::$$$message_0259_0034_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32223::$$$message_0259_0034_0001$$$::It's either nausea or chills.[lr]::
32224::$$$message_0259_0034_0002$$$::He's holding a bow.[lr]::
32225::$$$message_0259_0034_0003$$$::It's no different from before.[lr]::
32226::$$$message_0259_0034_0004$$$::Even if he aims perfectly, it won't do any damage.[lr]::
32227::$$$message_0259_0034_0005$$$::So there's no sense feeling so threatened by it...::
32228::$$$message_0259_0035_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32229::$$$message_0259_0035_0001$$$::...but I get chills anyway.[lr]::
32230::$$$message_0259_0035_0002$$$::He's nocked...it's not an arrow. It's something else.[lr]::
32231::$$$message_0259_0035_0003$$$::That intent to kill isn't directed solely at Berserker.::
32232::$$$message_0259_0036_0000$$$::"Sab[line2]"[lr]::
32233::$$$message_0259_0036_0001$$$::My legs move.[lr]::
32234::$$$message_0259_0036_0002$$$::I...::
