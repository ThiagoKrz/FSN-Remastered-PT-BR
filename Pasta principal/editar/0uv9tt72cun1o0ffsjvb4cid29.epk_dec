50429::$$$message_0435_0000_0000$$$::    I've never seen anything like this before.[lr]::
50430::$$$message_0435_0000_0001$$$::There's a sky of flames overhead.[lr]::
50431::$$$message_0435_0000_0002$$$::At my feet, the steel of uncountable blades.[lr]::
50432::$$$message_0435_0000_0003$$$::The remnants of war, perhaps.[lr]::
50433::$$$message_0435_0000_0004$$$::This world is endless and lifeless; not a single living thing inhabits it.::
50434::$$$message_0435_0001_0000$$$::A wind carries ashes through a forest of blades.[lr]::
50435::$$$message_0435_0001_0001$$$::The number of swords in this woodland of steel is uncanny.[lr]::
50436::$$$message_0435_0001_0002$$$::There's not just ten or twenty.[lr]::
50437::$$$message_0435_0001_0003$$$::Not even a hundred or two.[lr]::
50438::$$$message_0435_0001_0004$$$::Though there has to be an end somewhere, if someone can't count them all, the total number may as well be unlimited.::
50439::$$$message_0435_0002_0000$$$::The myriad weapons thrust upon the earth rust away from disuse.[lr]::
50440::$$$message_0435_0002_0001$$$::The remains of a great many swords.::
50441::$$$message_0435_0003_0000$$$::   He thinks that...[lr]::
50442::$$$message_0435_0003_0001$$$::   ...this place is like a graveyard.::
50443::$$$message_0435_0004_0000$$$::My vision returns.[lr]::
50444::$$$message_0435_0004_0001$$$::It's definitely late in the morning based on how sunny it already is.[lr]::
50445::$$$message_0435_0004_0002$$$::"...That dream..."[lr]::
50446::$$$message_0435_0004_0003$$$::I hazily open my eyes and try to remember the dream I was having.[lr]::
50447::$$$message_0435_0004_0004$$$::...A hill of swords.[lr]::
50448::$$$message_0435_0004_0005$$$::I must be dreaming that sort of thing because of the battle Saber had in the graveyard and that fire that[line2]::
50449::$$$message_0435_0005_0000$$$::"Oh, are you awake? That's good. I'm glad that it's nothing serious."[lr]::
50450::$$$message_0435_0005_0001$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
50451::$$$message_0435_0005_0002$$$::I realize...[lr]::
50452::$$$message_0435_0005_0003$$$::Rin Tohsaka is there, looking down at me with a real condescending expression as she speaks matter-of-factly. ::
50453::$$$message_0435_0006_0000$$$::"Aaah!"[lr]::
50454::$$$message_0435_0006_0001$$$::I fly out of bed.[lr]::
50455::$$$message_0435_0006_0002$$$::Like a startled cat, I scurry so my back is to the wall as far as I can get from Tohsaka.::
50456::$$$message_0435_0007_0000$$$::"T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-Tohsaka!? W-w-what!? Why are you in my room...!!!???"::
50457::$$$message_0435_0008_0000$$$::My head spins.[lr]::
50458::$$$message_0435_0008_0001$$$::I was on a hill of swords[line2]no, the burning cemetery with Saber, so why am I sleeping in my room and how is it already morning...!?::
50459::$$$message_0435_0009_0000$$$::"T-Tohsaka, why are you here!? And what am I doing here...!?"[lr]::
50460::$$$message_0435_0009_0001$$$::As soon as I say that, my head starts spinning more.[lr]::
50461::$$$message_0435_0009_0002$$$::This isn't just because I'm disoriented from everything else.[lr]::
50462::$$$message_0435_0009_0003$$$::What's really making my heart race is seeing Tohsaka's face so close up on top of everything else.::
50463::$$$message_0435_0010_0000$$$::"If you're going to be shocked about something, just pick one. You don't quite have the intellect for both, Emiya."[lr]::
50464::$$$message_0435_0010_0001$$$::Oblivious to how I feel, Tohsaka just carries on like normal.::
50465::$$$message_0435_0011_0000$$$::"Mrgh."[lr]::
50466::$$$message_0435_0011_0001$$$::It's enough of a slap to the face to bring me to my senses.[lr]::
50467::$$$message_0435_0011_0002$$$::That's right.[lr]::
50468::$$$message_0435_0011_0003$$$::It's natural to be surprised by Tohsaka's face as soon as I wake up.[lr]::
50469::$$$message_0435_0011_0004$$$::But, that must mean...::
50470::$$$message_0435_0012_0000$$$::"...I get it. You carried me here after I fell unconscious."::
50471::$$$message_0435_0013_0000$$$::"Wow. You're sharper than I thought. You look like a mess, but I guess upstairs is still working. Interesting, very interesting."::
50472::$$$message_0435_0014_0000$$$::Argh.[lr]::
50473::$$$message_0435_0014_0001$$$::I wish she'd stop saying stuff that makes it hard to tell whether she's being critical or giving a compliment.::
50474::$$$message_0435_0015_0000$$$::"...So part of the day has passed since then?[lr]::
50475::$$$message_0435_0015_0001$$$::You carried me home...I'm guessing that means nobody saw anything?"::
50476::$$$message_0435_0016_0000$$$::"Yeah, that's right. It helps that you understand."[lr]::
50477::$$$message_0435_0016_0001$$$::Perhaps that satisfied her.[lr]::
50478::$$$message_0435_0016_0002$$$::She bids a quick farewell and makes to leave.::
50479::$$$message_0435_0017_0000$$$::"Hey, wait. Where are you going?"[lr]::
50480::$$$message_0435_0017_0001$$$::"Still asleep over there? What do you mean, 'where am I going?' This is your house. I can't stay here forever."::
50481::$$$message_0435_0018_0000$$$::She speaks firmly.[lr]::
50482::$$$message_0435_0018_0001$$$::Her eyes say...[lr]::
50483::$$$message_0435_0018_0002$$$::"We're enemies."[r]::
50484::$$$message_0435_0018_0003$$$::Rather pointedly.::
50485::$$$message_0435_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50486::$$$message_0435_0019_0001$$$::That is...true.[lr]::
50487::$$$message_0435_0019_0002$$$::Last night...[lr]::
50488::$$$message_0435_0019_0003$$$::We declared that we would fight at the church.[lr]::
50489::$$$message_0435_0019_0004$$$::So then, we can only fight each other.::
50490::$$$message_0435_0020_0000$$$::"You're right, sorry. Also, this is late, but thank you."[lr]::
50491::$$$message_0435_0020_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
50492::$$$message_0435_0020_0002$$$::Then...[lr]::
50493::$$$message_0435_0020_0003$$$::Tohsaka pauses and glares at me.::
50494::$$$message_0435_0021_0000$$$::"Hold on. Why are you thanking me?"[lr]::
50495::$$$message_0435_0021_0001$$$::"Well, you helped me out, right? I'm even more thankful if you insist on being enemies."::
50496::$$$message_0435_0022_0000$$$::"Hey. Sit right there, Emiya."::
50497::$$$message_0435_0023_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
50498::$$$message_0435_0023_0001$$$::I don't know why she's doing this, but I have a feeling I'd better listen, or else.::
50499::$$$message_0435_0024_0000$$$::"Come on, hurry up."[lr]::
50500::$$$message_0435_0024_0001$$$::She taps the floor.[lr]::
50501::$$$message_0435_0024_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
50502::$$$message_0435_0024_0003$$$::...It seems like she has something serious to tell me.[lr]::
50503::$$$message_0435_0024_0004$$$::I obediently sit down, if that's the case.::
50504::$$$message_0435_0025_0000$$$::"Look. I have to say this since you don't seem to get it. You're going to die if you keep thinking like that."[lr]::
50505::$$$message_0435_0025_0001$$$::"Mm? What do you mean?"::
50506::$$$message_0435_0026_0000$$$::"...I'm telling you not to thank your enemies, even offhandedly. If you're concerned about something like that, you're not going to make it even if you had extra lives.[lr]::
50507::$$$message_0435_0026_0001$$$::Look, you have to think of them as obstacles. Just because they look and talk like a human doesn't mean they're anything like you."::
50508::$$$message_0435_0027_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50509::$$$message_0435_0027_0001$$$::Tohsaka explains it with a firm voice and strong look.[lr]::
50510::$$$message_0435_0027_0002$$$::...She [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] right.[lr]::
50511::$$$message_0435_0027_0003$$$::If it's dangerous to feel sympathy for an enemy, it'd be a mistake to waste time worrying about this sort of thing.[lr]::
50512::$$$message_0435_0027_0004$$$::Since I've decided to fight, I need to focus on defeating them.[lr]::
50513::$$$message_0435_0027_0005$$$::   Yeah, I get why she's saying this.[lr]::
50514::$$$message_0435_0027_0006$$$::But, that is...::
50515::$$$message_0435_0028_0000$$$::"Hey, are you listening!? The Holy Grail War is where you kill each other to win the prize. In order to do that, you can't think of other Masters as fellow people. Even if it's your family, you need to come to terms with seeing them as a target to destroy. Really, this is the first rule as a Master."::
50516::$$$message_0435_0029_0000$$$::Yeah, but then...[lr]::
50517::$$$message_0435_0029_0001$$$::"I understand that. But if so, why didn't you kill me?"[lr]::
50518::$$$message_0435_0029_0002$$$::Wouldn't that be an issue?::
50519::$$$message_0435_0030_0000$$$::"Uh... T-that's because..."[lr]::
50520::$$$message_0435_0030_0001$$$::And just where did all that bluster go, now?[lr]::
50521::$$$message_0435_0030_0002$$$::She clears her throat, even more troubled.::
50522::$$$message_0435_0031_0000$$$::"H-hmph. I just didn't feel like it. I owed you and it's not fair to attack you when you're sleeping. I just didn't like the idea, okay?"::
50523::$$$message_0435_0032_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. Didn't you just tell me to do whatever I can to win?"[lr]::
50524::$$$message_0435_0032_0001$$$::"That's right. So this is a mistake on my part. I suppose I'm not afraid since I'm so much stronger than you. Well, I guess it's extra weight on my mind."[lr]::
50525::$$$message_0435_0032_0002$$$::Oh, I've heard her say that before.::
50526::$$$message_0435_0033_0000$$$::"'Weight on your mind'? Does that mean you're fat?"[lr]::
50527::$$$message_0435_0033_0001$$$::"Hehehe. You say funny things, Emiya."::
50528::$$$message_0435_0034_0000$$$::"But you should think real long and hard from here on out. If you aren't careful, you [font italic=true]will[font italic=false] end up dead."[lr]::
50529::$$$message_0435_0034_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50530::$$$message_0435_0034_0002$$$::...That was scary.[lr]::
50531::$$$message_0435_0034_0003$$$::I just crawled backwards instinctively.::
50532::$$$message_0435_0035_0000$$$::"...Well anyway, that's all I have to say. Ask your Servant about the rest."[lr]::
50533::$$$message_0435_0035_0001$$$::Tohsaka stands up and heads out without stopping this time.::
50534::$$$message_0435_0036_0000$$$::"Goodbye. We'll be enemies next time we meet, so be prepared."::
50535::$$$message_0435_0037_0000$$$::With that, she's gone.[lr]::
50536::$$$message_0435_0037_0001$$$::It must've really been on a whim when she carried me here and treated me.[lr]::
50537::$$$message_0435_0037_0002$$$::She left without any regret or expressing any sentiment. Just a declaration that we're enemies.::
50538::$$$message_0435_0038_0000$$$::"...Well."[lr]::
50539::$$$message_0435_0038_0001$$$::I take a quick breath and try to organize my thoughts.[lr]::
50540::$$$message_0435_0038_0002$$$::I haven't even had time to think since witnessing that fight between Lancer and Archer back at the school.::
50541::$$$message_0435_0039_0000$$$::"...Oh. I see, then that must've been Tohsaka."[lr]::
50542::$$$message_0435_0039_0001$$$::The pieces finally start falling into place.::
50543::$$$message_0435_0040_0000$$$::After that, I got stabbed in the heart by Lancer, somehow got saved and came home, then got attacked by Lancer again...::
50544::$$$message_0435_0041_0000$$$::"Saber saved me, and I became a Master."[lr]::
50545::$$$message_0435_0041_0001$$$::So then I had things explained at the church.[lr]::
50546::$$$message_0435_0041_0002$$$::The Holy Grail War, a battle to the death.[lr]::
50547::$$$message_0435_0041_0003$$$::A Holy Grail...a device said to grant any wish to the victor.::
50548::$$$message_0435_0042_0000$$$::...None of that has sunk in yet, but I've been attacked by enemies three times already.[lr]::
50549::$$$message_0435_0042_0001$$$::I can't afford to stay clueless forever.[lr]::
50550::$$$message_0435_0042_0002$$$::Most importantly, I said that I would fight. Not that I had any real choice.::
50551::$$$message_0435_0043_0000$$$::...A life-and-death game of musical chairs.[lr]::
50552::$$$message_0435_0043_0001$$$::No matter what your expectations are, once you participate, you can't survive unless you defeat your enemies.[lr]::
50553::$$$message_0435_0043_0002$$$::The problem is depending on how you go about it, you run the risk of harming other innocent people who aren't involved.::
50554::$$$message_0435_0044_0000$$$::So,[lr]::
50555::$$$message_0435_0044_0001$$$::    [font italic=true]Rejoice, Shirou Emiya.[font italic=false][lr]::
50556::$$$message_0435_0044_0002$$$::My reason to fight in the Holy Grail War is not to survive and win.[lr]::
50557::$$$message_0435_0044_0003$$$::    [font italic=true]Your wish will finally be granted.[font italic=false][lr]::
50558::$$$message_0435_0044_0004$$$::It's to do everything I can to stop those who will try to win by any means necessary.::
50559::$$$message_0435_0045_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50560::$$$message_0435_0045_0001$$$::...There should be nothing wrong with that.[lr]::
50561::$$$message_0435_0045_0002$$$::To champion justice, I've been practicing magecraft to save any innocent lives that may be wrongly victimized.::
50562::$$$message_0435_0046_0000$$$::"All right. I need to talk to Saber first."[lr]::
50563::$$$message_0435_0046_0001$$$::I try to shake the priest's words as they cling to the back of my mind as I make my way towards the hall.::
