29909::$$$message_0241_0000_0000$$$::   The morning is near.[lr]::
29910::$$$message_0241_0000_0001$$$::My eyes are still closed and I'm still only half awake, but I sense that the night has ended.::
29911::$$$message_0241_0001_0000$$$::The only thing left is this comfortable listlessness.[lr]::
29912::$$$message_0241_0001_0001$$$::My hands are so tired that they can't grip a sword, and my body doesn't have an ounce of magical energy left.[lr]::
29913::$$$message_0241_0001_0002$$$::To be honest, I am burned out.::
29914::$$$message_0241_0002_0000$$$::"...Oh."[lr]::
29915::$$$message_0241_0002_0001$$$::But, it's not a regretful end.[lr]::
29916::$$$message_0241_0002_0002$$$::I have a feeling of accomplishment, as I have done everything that I can do.[lr]::
29917::$$$message_0241_0002_0003$$$::I'm only burned out now.[lr]::
29918::$$$message_0241_0002_0004$$$::My rested body is starting to return to its regular pulse and is ready to welcome another morning.::
29919::$$$message_0241_0003_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
29920::$$$message_0241_0003_0001$$$::My mind starts to become clear.[lr]::
29921::$$$message_0241_0003_0002$$$::My once-gray mind sways drowsily. I should wake up in a moment.[lr]::
29922::$$$message_0241_0003_0003$$$::Right before that...[lr]::
29923::$$$message_0241_0003_0004$$$::I recall him for the last time.::
29924::$$$message_0241_0004_0000$$$::His fluttering cloak is no more.[lr]::
29925::$$$message_0241_0004_0001$$$::That man left, along with that ever-burning sky.[lr]::
29926::$$$message_0241_0004_0002$$$::He did not turn back nor explain anything.[lr]::
29927::$$$message_0241_0004_0003$$$::He just leaves behind his back that he is not ashamed of.::
29928::$$$message_0241_0005_0000$$$::I follow that path with my eyes.[lr]::
29929::$$$message_0241_0005_0001$$$::One end.[lr]::
29930::$$$message_0241_0005_0002$$$::I reach my hand out to the man that went after the same ideal and path.[lr]::
29931::$$$message_0241_0005_0003$$$::As I have beaten him, I will not run away.[lr]::
29932::$$$message_0241_0005_0004$$$::I grip my empty fist tightly, as if to tell him that I'll reach him some day...::
29933::$$$message_0241_0006_0000$$$::"Mm... Mm."[lr]::
29934::$$$message_0241_0006_0001$$$::I wake up with the morning sunlight.[lr]::
29935::$$$message_0241_0006_0002$$$::My body feels slightly heavy and is covered in wounds.::
29936::$$$message_0241_0007_0000$$$::"...Huh? This is my room."[lr]::
29937::$$$message_0241_0007_0001$$$::I look around the room blankly and look at the clock.[lr]::
29938::$$$message_0241_0007_0002$$$::It's 10 AM, and the date is February 16th.[lr]::
29939::$$$message_0241_0007_0003$$$::"Whoa. It's been a whole day."[lr]::
29940::$$$message_0241_0007_0004$$$::I'm surprised, but my mind is objectively calm.::
29941::$$$message_0241_0008_0000$$$:: After the battle at Ryudou Templeâ€¦[lr]::
29942::$$$message_0241_0008_0001$$$::I must've been carried here after I passed out and slept the whole day.::
29943::$$$message_0241_0009_0000$$$::"...But it's too quiet. Tohsaka... must have gone home already.[lr]::
29944::$$$message_0241_0009_0001$$$::Hey, Saber. Are you awa[line2]"[lr]::
29945::$$$message_0241_0009_0002$$$::I stop before I finish.[lr]::
29946::$$$message_0241_0009_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
29947::$$$message_0241_0009_0004$$$::There's no way she's awake.[lr]::
29948::$$$message_0241_0009_0005$$$::No, first of all, there's no way she's here.::
29949::$$$message_0241_0010_0000$$$::The Holy Grail doesn't exist anymore.[lr]::
29950::$$$message_0241_0010_0001$$$::The thing that can keep Servants in this world is now gone.[lr]::
29951::$$$message_0241_0010_0002$$$::Therefore... That blonde girl is no longer in this world anymore.::
29952::$$$message_0241_0011_0000$$$::"Oh... That's right."[lr]::
29953::$$$message_0241_0011_0001$$$::I cover both of my eyes with my hands and look up at the ceiling, as if to endure something.[lr]::
29954::$$$message_0241_0011_0002$$$::The room is dead silent.[lr]::
29955::$$$message_0241_0011_0003$$$::The winter morning is cold, and the air that I breathe in tightens my lungs.[lr]::
29956::$$$message_0241_0011_0004$$$::...The time seemed both long and short.[lr]::
29957::$$$message_0241_0011_0005$$$::The events that happened within these two weeks, and the traces she left in this room pass by me.::
29958::$$$message_0241_0012_0000$$$::                                        "...We shall talk afterwards."::
29959::$$$message_0241_0013_0000$$$::Her saying that and running off was the last I saw of her.[lr]::
29960::$$$message_0241_0013_0001$$$::Her retreating figure.[lr]::
29961::$$$message_0241_0013_0002$$$::We knew that we would not meet again,[lr]::
29962::$$$message_0241_0013_0003$$$::touch each other again,[lr]::
29963::$$$message_0241_0013_0004$$$::or return with the three of us again.[lr]::
29964::$$$message_0241_0013_0005$$$::Knowing there was nothing that could be done, we didn't exchange words of farewell.::
29965::$$$message_0241_0014_0000$$$::"Mm... I'm hungry."[lr]::
29966::$$$message_0241_0014_0001$$$::I stand up.[lr]::
29967::$$$message_0241_0014_0002$$$::The joints of my body hurt when I move, and I realize that fight wasn't a dream.::
29968::$$$message_0241_0015_0000$$$::"Oof, it's cold."[lr]::
29969::$$$message_0241_0015_0001$$$::The hallway is freezing.[lr]::
29970::$$$message_0241_0015_0002$$$::The hallway creaks as I quickly make my way towards the living room.::
29971::$$$message_0241_0016_0000$$$::"...Well..."[lr]::
29972::$$$message_0241_0016_0001$$$::I get to the kitchen and put my apron on.[lr]::
29973::$$$message_0241_0016_0002$$$::I put the frying pan over fire, cut two slices of bread, and take out some eggs that are about to expire.[lr]::
29974::$$$message_0241_0016_0003$$$::"Hup."[lr]::
29975::$$$message_0241_0016_0004$$$::I toast the bread and crack open the eggs on the pan.[lr]::
29976::$$$message_0241_0016_0005$$$::I hear the sweet sound of oil popping, as I prepare some plates and make two nice sunny-side up eggs.::
29977::$$$message_0241_0017_0000$$$::"All right, perfect."[lr]::
29978::$$$message_0241_0017_0001$$$::I put the eggs on some white plates and put the toast in the basket.[lr]::
29979::$$$message_0241_0017_0002$$$::I turn to the living room from the kitchen and...[lr]::
29980::$$$message_0241_0017_0003$$$::"...Oh."[lr]::
29981::$$$message_0241_0017_0004$$$::I realize that there's no one else in the living room.::
29982::$$$message_0241_0018_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
29983::$$$message_0241_0018_0001$$$::I take a deep sigh.[lr]::
29984::$$$message_0241_0018_0002$$$::The girl that was waiting for breakfast in the living room every morning isn't here anymore.[lr]::
29985::$$$message_0241_0018_0003$$$::Reality finally hits me.[lr]::
29986::$$$message_0241_0018_0004$$$::...The war has ended.[lr]::
29987::$$$message_0241_0018_0005$$$::The battle over the Holy Grail has come to an end.[lr]::
29988::$$$message_0241_0018_0006$$$::How dumb of me to finally realize that now... by experiencing a morning without her.::
29989::$$$message_0241_0019_0000$$$::"...I made too much."[lr]::
29990::$$$message_0241_0019_0001$$$::I put the frying pan down.[lr]::
29991::$$$message_0241_0019_0002$$$::My appetite is gone, even though I was hungry.[lr]::
29992::$$$message_0241_0019_0003$$$::I take my apron off and go past the living room.[lr]::
29993::$$$message_0241_0019_0004$$$::It's nice outside.[lr]::
29994::$$$message_0241_0019_0005$$$::I felt like seeing the dojo where I first talked to her, so I leave behind the breakfast that I made too much of.::
29995::$$$message_0241_0020_0000$$$::I step inside the empty dojo.[lr]::
29996::$$$message_0241_0020_0001$$$::The faint sunlight illuminates the wooden floor.[lr]::
29997::$$$message_0241_0020_0002$$$::There...::
29998::$$$message_0241_0021_0000$$$::An unmistakable figure sits there in a dignified manner.::
29999::$$$message_0241_0022_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
30000::$$$message_0241_0022_0001$$$::My eyes widen.[lr]::
30001::$$$message_0241_0022_0002$$$::Did I time travel back to two weeks ago or something...!?[lr]::
30002::$$$message_0241_0022_0003$$$::"...Shirou? Are you awake?"::
30003::$$$message_0241_0023_0000$$$::"It seems like you are fine now.[lr]::
30004::$$$message_0241_0023_0001$$$::I thought that you would wake up soon since your wounds were small."::
30005::$$$message_0241_0024_0000$$$::"Shirou? What is wrong? Your mouth has been open for a while.[lr]::
30006::$$$message_0241_0024_0001$$$::...Do you have a wound that is not apparent?"::
30007::$$$message_0241_0025_0000$$$::"Huh... Oh, no, that's not it, but..."[lr]::
30008::$$$message_0241_0025_0001$$$::My confusion is dealing more damage than a fatal wound, and it's taking me a lot of time to recover.::
30009::$$$message_0241_0026_0000$$$::"S-Saber."[lr]::
30010::$$$message_0241_0026_0001$$$::"Yes. What is it, Shirou?"[lr]::
30011::$$$message_0241_0026_0002$$$::"Oh... Yeah. You're Saber right, Saber?"::
30012::$$$message_0241_0027_0000$$$:: "It's as you can see...Or do I look like Archer or Lancer to you?"[lr]::
30013::$$$message_0241_0027_0001$$$::"...Of course not. You don't look like anyone else at all."[lr]::
30014::$$$message_0241_0027_0002$$$::I shake my head.[lr]::
30015::$$$message_0241_0027_0003$$$::"Yes, of course. You are covered with wounds, but you are Shirou like always."::
30016::$$$message_0241_0028_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30017::$$$message_0241_0028_0001$$$::That finally calms my panicked mind down.[lr]::
30018::$$$message_0241_0028_0002$$$::Well, it's more like my train of thought stopped as I was admiring Saber.::
30019::$$$message_0241_0029_0000$$$::"Saber. You're really Saber?"[lr]::
30020::$$$message_0241_0029_0001$$$::"That is what I am telling you. Hm... Is there something wrong with your eyes, Shirou?"::
30021::$$$message_0241_0030_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
30022::$$$message_0241_0030_0001$$$::Saber reaches out to me.[lr]::
30023::$$$message_0241_0030_0002$$$::She feels for my eyelids, and she definitely seems real.[lr]::
30024::$$$message_0241_0030_0003$$$::Her pale fingers gently touch my eyelids, then pull away.::
30025::$$$message_0241_0031_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30026::$$$message_0241_0031_0001$$$::There is no doubt about it now.[lr]::
30027::$$$message_0241_0031_0002$$$::Saber is Saber.[lr]::
30028::$$$message_0241_0031_0003$$$::She's still here as always even though the Holy Grail is gone.::
30029::$$$message_0241_0032_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30030::$$$message_0241_0032_0001$$$::I sigh.[lr]::
30031::$$$message_0241_0032_0002$$$::I let out the air in my chest, and...[lr]::
30032::$$$message_0241_0032_0003$$$::"...Morning, Saber. I'm glad to be able to see you again."[lr]::
30033::$$$message_0241_0032_0004$$$::I tell her the first thing that pops into my head.::
30034::$$$message_0241_0033_0000$$$::"Good morning, Shirou. I am also glad to be able to greet you again."[lr]::
30035::$$$message_0241_0033_0001$$$::She smiles radiantly.[lr]::
30036::$$$message_0241_0033_0002$$$::She shows no worry that she will disappear soon.::
30037::$$$message_0241_0034_0000$$$::"Yeah. But Saber, how are you still here? Um, the Holy Grail doesn't exist anymore, right?"[lr]::
30038::$$$message_0241_0034_0001$$$::Then...[lr]::
30039::$$$message_0241_0034_0002$$$::I stop myself from saying that Servants can't stay in this world.::
30040::$$$message_0241_0035_0000$$$::"Saber...?"[lr]::
30041::$$$message_0241_0035_0001$$$::"Shirou. Please ask Rin about this matter. She has been waiting for you to notice her."[lr]::
30042::$$$message_0241_0035_0002$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
30043::$$$message_0241_0035_0003$$$::Hearing this, I turn around.::
30044::$$$message_0241_0036_0000$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
30045::$$$message_0241_0036_0001$$$::"What a response. You're all kind to Saber, but all I get is 'oh'?"::
30046::$$$message_0241_0037_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka. You were here?"[lr]::
30047::$$$message_0241_0037_0001$$$::"I was! I was taking position here since you didn't wake up after that!"[lr]::
30048::$$$message_0241_0037_0002$$$::She glares at me, as if to ask, "Is there a problem!?"::
30049::$$$message_0241_0038_0000$$$::"Huh... You mean you were staying at my place!?"::
30050::$$$message_0241_0039_0000$$$::"Yeah. I had to treat your wounds, and I had to explain to Ms. Fujimura and Sakura. I can't leave you and go home by myself."[lr]::
30051::$$$message_0241_0039_0001$$$::"Oh... I see, that's true... Sorry, Tohsaka. I caused you trouble again."::
30052::$$$message_0241_0040_0000$$$::"...You don't have to thank me. You're not causing me trouble, and besides, you were the biggest contributor to our victory. Just accept it as a reward. We'll cut you some slack today."::
30053::$$$message_0241_0041_0000$$$::She says, looking away.[lr]::
30054::$$$message_0241_0041_0001$$$::That was so like her that it makes me relieved.[lr]::
30055::$$$message_0241_0041_0002$$$::Just like Saber and I were safe, Tohsaka also got through the war safe.::
30056::$$$message_0241_0042_0000$$$::"...I see. Thank you for everything, Tohsaka.[lr]::
30057::$$$message_0241_0042_0001$$$::A lot happened, but we made it back."[lr]::
30058::$$$message_0241_0042_0002$$$::I extend my hand to express my gratitude and accomplishment.::
30059::$$$message_0241_0043_0000$$$::"Well, you're right. We didn't lose anyone, so it was a complete victory. I guess 'congratulations' is the appropriate word to close things off."[lr]::
30060::$$$message_0241_0043_0001$$$::She shakes my hand, smiling.::
30061::$$$message_0241_0044_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30062::$$$message_0241_0044_0001$$$::Tohsaka's hand that I held is soft, and it troubles me as it reminds me of that night.[lr]::
30063::$$$message_0241_0044_0002$$$::But even while blushing, we still confirm each other's existence in each other's hands.::
30064::$$$message_0241_0045_0000$$$::"...So. That's fine, but Tohsaka. What did you do to Saber?"::
30065::$$$message_0241_0046_0000$$$::"Huh? I didn't do anything to her. We just continued our contract, so she's still my familiar. Saber is the strongest familiar, so I can't let her go that easily."[lr]::
30066::$$$message_0241_0046_0001$$$::Tohsaka casually replies.[lr]::
30067::$$$message_0241_0046_0002$$$::But, it's not that simple.::
30068::$$$message_0241_0047_0000$$$::"Hey, Saber became a Servant in exchange for the Holy Grail. She should be free now that her reward's gone."::
30069::$$$message_0241_0048_0000$$$::"I see. Did you hear that, Saber? Shirou is saying you should go back already."[lr]::
30070::$$$message_0241_0048_0001$$$::"Mrgh."::
30071::$$$message_0241_0049_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]N-no...! Of course not![lr]::
30072::$$$message_0241_0049_0001$$$::What I'm trying to say is that there's no use in keeping Saber as a familiar[line2]"::
30073::$$$message_0241_0050_0000$$$::"There is. Saber can't stay in this world unless she has a contract with a mage now that the Holy Grail is gone. So having her become my familiar is the best way, right?"::
30074::$$$message_0241_0051_0000$$$::"First of all, I'm giving Saber most of my magical energy, so she has to at least do that much in return. The fundamental rule of magecraft is an equivalent exchange.[lr]::
30075::$$$message_0241_0051_0001$$$::Mm, or what? Are you not happy that Saber stayed?"::
30076::$$$message_0241_0052_0000$$$::"Idio[line2]Of course I'm happy...![lr]::
30077::$$$message_0241_0052_0001$$$::But, isn't it wrong that Saber is still a Servant?[lr]::
30078::$$$message_0241_0052_0002$$$::Besides... Are you able to keep Saber in this world even without the Holy Grail?"::
30079::$$$message_0241_0053_0000$$$::...Yes, that's the biggest problem.[lr]::
30080::$$$message_0241_0053_0001$$$::It's beyond human capabilities to make a Heroic Spirit into a familiar.[lr]::
30081::$$$message_0241_0053_0002$$$::Even if Tohsaka is a genius mage, it's not possible to support Saber.::
30082::$$$message_0241_0054_0000$$$::...So there's only one way.[lr]::
30083::$$$message_0241_0054_0001$$$::Familiars that cannot be supported with magical energy from their contractor have to get magical energy from elsewhere.[lr]::
30084::$$$message_0241_0054_0002$$$::She'd have to become a vengeful spirit like Rider and survive by eating the souls of the people in town...::
30085::$$$message_0241_0055_0000$$$::"Hey. I don't know what you're thinking with that gloomy face, but hear me out.[lr]::
30086::$$$message_0241_0055_0001$$$::Look, it is difficult to maintain Saber just by myself. But, we have one more mage here. If the two of us cooperate, we should be able to keep Saber in this world."::
30087::$$$message_0241_0056_0000$$$::"Wha... You mean me!?"[lr]::
30088::$$$message_0241_0056_0001$$$::"Of course. Who else is there?"::
30089::$$$message_0241_0057_0000$$$::"Well... I'm glad you're counting on me, but that's troubling. I don't know how to make a contract with a familiar, and I can't do anything that skillful."::
30090::$$$message_0241_0058_0000$$$::"Of course I already took that into consideration.[lr]::
30091::$$$message_0241_0058_0001$$$::I'll supply magical energy to Saber by myself, so you just have to support me. It won't be as much as Saber, but I'll be at an inconvenience as well."::
30092::$$$message_0241_0059_0000$$$::I don't know what she's angry about, but Tohsaka explains while turning away from me.[lr]::
30093::$$$message_0241_0059_0001$$$::Putting her attitude aside...[lr]::
30094::$$$message_0241_0059_0002$$$::"...Hm? What do you mean by 'support'?"[lr]::
30095::$$$message_0241_0059_0003$$$::I address the biggest question I have.::
30096::$$$message_0241_0060_0000$$$::"Well, a lot of things. It's not like I have to say each one out loud, right?"[lr]::
30097::$$$message_0241_0060_0001$$$::"Huh? I'm sorry, Tohsaka, but I don't get it just by 'a lot of things.' Don't be lazy and explain it to me properly."::
30098::$$$message_0241_0061_0000$$$::"I-it's just stuff, okay!? Come on, you should know what I mean, idiot!!!"::
30099::$$$message_0241_0062_0000$$$::"Guh..."[lr]::
30100::$$$message_0241_0062_0001$$$::D-damn, my ears are ringing... W-what's up with Tohsaka, yelling like that all of a sudden?::
30101::$$$message_0241_0063_0000$$$::"...Humph. Anyways, I can keep Saber in this world as my familiar.[lr]::
30102::$$$message_0241_0063_0001$$$::You want Saber to stay here, right?[lr]::
30103::$$$message_0241_0063_0002$$$::Then, you shouldn't have any complaints."::
30104::$$$message_0241_0064_0000$$$::"Mrgh."[lr]::
30105::$$$message_0241_0064_0001$$$::Well, if Saber can stay, then that's more than I can ask for.[lr]::
30106::$$$message_0241_0064_0002$$$::But, that's only if Saber consents to it.[lr]::
30107::$$$message_0241_0064_0003$$$::It's wrong to keep Saber in this world if she has no business here anymore.::
30108::$$$message_0241_0065_0000$$$::"Shirou. Do you have something against me staying here?"[lr]::
30109::$$$message_0241_0065_0001$$$::Saber must've sensed my doubt, as she quietly asks.::
30110::$$$message_0241_0066_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30111::$$$message_0241_0066_0001$$$::...I have no objections.[lr]::
30112::$$$message_0241_0066_0002$$$::I don't want to object, but this is something I have to ask.::
30113::$$$message_0241_0067_0000$$$::"Saber. There is no Holy Grail in this town anymore. Your wish won't be granted even if you stay here.[lr]::
30114::$$$message_0241_0067_0001$$$::...Are you fine with that...?"::
30115::$$$message_0241_0068_0000$$$::"Yes. I am staying in this age out of my own will.[lr]::
30116::$$$message_0241_0068_0001$$$::...I would like to watch over you until the very end.[lr]::
30117::$$$message_0241_0068_0002$$$::He said that I am wrong for that... Please tell me the answer to that someday."::
30118::$$$message_0241_0069_0000$$$::Her voice is calm, but I feel a strong will from it.[lr]::
30119::$$$message_0241_0069_0001$$$::It's the same as that night.[lr]::
30120::$$$message_0241_0069_0002$$$::It's the same pure voice that told me of our contract when I first met her.::
30121::$$$message_0241_0070_0000$$$::"...Saber."[lr]::
30122::$$$message_0241_0070_0001$$$::"Yes. It may be troubling for you, but please forgive me.[lr]::
30123::$$$message_0241_0070_0002$$$::As compensation, I shall help you just as I have up to now."::
30124::$$$message_0241_0071_0000$$$::I stare back at her.[lr]::
30125::$$$message_0241_0071_0001$$$::...I don't know if I can meet her expectations.[lr]::
30126::$$$message_0241_0071_0002$$$::But I'm sure I won't stray from my path if she watches over me, no matter what awaits me in the future...::
30127::$$$message_0241_0072_0000$$$::"All right, all right![lr]::
30128::$$$message_0241_0072_0001$$$::It's fine to stare at each other, but we're not getting anywhere like that!"::
30129::$$$message_0241_0073_0000$$$::"T-Tohsaka...!? W-w-why the loud voice? You scared me."::
30130::$$$message_0241_0074_0000$$$::"...Humph. It's because you two are flirting.[lr]::
30131::$$$message_0241_0074_0001$$$::Listen up. Let's get back on topic.[lr]::
30132::$$$message_0241_0074_0002$$$::Saber will form a contract with me, and Shirou will cooperate. It's an ex post facto approval, but are you two all right with that?"::
30133::$$$message_0241_0075_0000$$$::"...Yeah, I have no complaints if Saber consents to it.[lr]::
30134::$$$message_0241_0075_0001$$$::But what do you mean by cooperate? I still don't know what I'm supposed to do, so I'm a bit reluctant to agree."[lr]::
30135::$$$message_0241_0075_0002$$$::I ask, hoping that Saber would agree.::
30136::$$$message_0241_0076_0000$$$::"Yes. It would be difficult for Shirou to make a promise he does not know much about.[lr]::
30137::$$$message_0241_0076_0001$$$::Rin, what do you mean by having Shirou support you?"::
30138::$$$message_0241_0077_0000$$$::Saber questions, and Rin retreats, as if defeated.[lr]::
30139::$$$message_0241_0077_0001$$$::Good, good.[lr]::
30140::$$$message_0241_0077_0002$$$::Even Tohsaka would have to give up if a third party gives an objective opinion.::
30141::$$$message_0241_0078_0000$$$::"Come on. Saber's saying so too, so give me a clear explanation."[lr]::
30142::$$$message_0241_0078_0001$$$::I pursue her, as my chance of victory.[lr]::
30143::$$$message_0241_0078_0002$$$::However...::
30144::$$$message_0241_0079_0000$$$::"Geez, just be quiet![lr]::
30145::$$$message_0241_0079_0001$$$::Saber is mine, and you're mine too, so no arguing back to me![lr]::
30146::$$$message_0241_0079_0002$$$::Familiars should listen to their Master without talking back!!!"::
30147::$$$message_0241_0080_0000$$$::Tohsaka is displaying her outrageous dictatorship.::
30148::$$$message_0241_0081_0000$$$::"...Hey, hold on. I'm not yours."::
30149::$$$message_0241_0082_0000$$$::"What, Shirou, you made a contract with me![lr]::
30150::$$$message_0241_0082_0001$$$::You're like a familiar from the moment you pulled magical energy from me, so I'm allowed to say this much...!"::
30151::$$$message_0241_0083_0000$$$::"Agh... Oof."[lr]::
30152::$$$message_0241_0083_0001$$$::I recall that night, being pressured with a threatening attitude, and freeze up.[lr]::
30153::$$$message_0241_0083_0002$$$::...And I can tell that Tohsaka herself...[lr]::
30154::$$$message_0241_0083_0003$$$::"Crap, I'm saying such a ridiculous thing...!"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
30155::$$$message_0241_0083_0004$$$::...is also regretting it, and I strangely kind of feel bad.::
30156::$$$message_0241_0083_0005$$$::"...Well, I did manage to survive using your magical energy, and it's true that I made a contract with you, so I guess that's one way to put it..."::
30157::$$$message_0241_0084_0000$$$::"Heh. It is true![lr]::
30158::$$$message_0241_0084_0001$$$::Anyway, that's it. Our cooperation is still ongoing."::
30159::$$$message_0241_0085_0000$$$::"...By the way, I don't want an amateur as an ally, so I'm going to have you become a proper mage.[lr]::
30160::$$$message_0241_0085_0001$$$::I'll teach you magecraft, and Saber's going to teach you how to fight. We're going to be hard on you, so brace yourself."::
30161::$$$message_0241_0086_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30162::$$$message_0241_0086_0001$$$::I'm taken aback from the sudden proposal.[lr]::
30163::$$$message_0241_0086_0002$$$::That's dependable, but that means, um...::
30164::$$$message_0241_0087_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, are you going to become my magecraft mentor...?"::
30165::$$$message_0241_0088_0000$$$::"It can't be helped, right? There's no other suitable person.[lr]::
30166::$$$message_0241_0088_0001$$$::A-and you're mine, so I can't let someone else do it."::
30167::$$$message_0241_0089_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
30168::$$$message_0241_0089_0001$$$::    That's unfair.[lr]::
30169::$$$message_0241_0089_0002$$$::She's going to make me blush if she says that with a flushed face.::
30170::$$$message_0241_0090_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30171::$$$message_0241_0090_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
30172::$$$message_0241_0090_0002$$$::We're both blushing and become stiff, unsure what to say.::
30173::$$$message_0241_0091_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30174::$$$message_0241_0091_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
30175::$$$message_0241_0091_0002$$$::...I need more training.[lr]::
30176::$$$message_0241_0091_0003$$$::I can't speak because I'm too conscious of her.::
30177::$$$message_0241_0092_0000$$$::And right before Tohsaka is about to go on a rampage from too much tension.::
30178::$$$message_0241_0093_0000$$$::"Rin. If we are done talking, why don't we have breakfast?"[lr]::
30179::$$$message_0241_0093_0001$$$::Saber comes to the rescue.::
30180::$$$message_0241_0094_0000$$$::"Y-you're right. I'm getting hungry too. You haven't eaten breakfast yet, right, Shirou?"[lr]::
30181::$$$message_0241_0094_0001$$$::Tohsaka is acting awkward.::
30182::$$$message_0241_0095_0000$$$::"N-no. I prepared breakfast as soon as I woke up, but I came here before eating, so I haven't eaten yet."[lr]::
30183::$$$message_0241_0095_0001$$$::I also answer awkwardly.::
30184::$$$message_0241_0096_0000$$$::"Huh? What, so you have breakfast ready?"[lr]::
30185::$$$message_0241_0096_0001$$$::"Yeah. There are two servings of toast."[lr]::
30186::$$$message_0241_0096_0002$$$::"Really? Well, that's thoughtful of you, Shirou.[lr]::
30187::$$$message_0241_0096_0003$$$::Let's hurry and go to the living room, Saber."::
30188::$$$message_0241_0097_0000$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
30189::$$$message_0241_0097_0001$$$::I don't know where that previous awkwardness went, as Tohsaka pulls Saber's hand and leaves the dojo.::
30190::$$$message_0241_0098_0000$$$::I watch them leave for ten seconds, dumbfounded.::
30191::$$$message_0241_0099_0000$$$::"Hey, what are you standing there for, Shirou!?[lr]::
30192::$$$message_0241_0099_0001$$$::We can't start eating until we're all there!"::
30193::$$$message_0241_0100_0000$$$::She calls back to me, still pulling Saber's hand.[lr]::
30194::$$$message_0241_0100_0001$$$::Tohsaka, who fled from the dojo, is stopping in the yard and waving to me.::
30195::$$$message_0241_0100_0002$$$::"...Well. She really doesn't waste any time."[lr]::
30196::$$$message_0241_0100_0003$$$::I've been pulled around plenty already, but I'm sure that will continue from now on.[lr]::
30197::$$$message_0241_0100_0004$$$::As long as I'm with her, this is just an everyday thing.[lr]::
30198::$$$message_0241_0100_0005$$$::You can't keep up with Tohsaka unless you're prepared enough.::
30199::$$$message_0241_0100_0006$$$::But well, to put it her way, it can't be helped.[lr]::
30200::$$$message_0241_0100_0007$$$::She was able to make it this far since she's like that, and that's exactly the girl I fell in love with.::
30201::$$$message_0241_0100_0008$$$::"Come on, hurry! We're going to start eating without you!"::
30202::$$$message_0241_0100_0009$$$::Even while saying so, she's standing there and waiting for me.[lr]::
30203::$$$message_0241_0100_0010$$$::She's always grumpy and cool-headed, but she's really good-natured deep down.::
30204::$$$message_0241_0100_0011$$$::"Yeah, I'm coming...! Hold on!"[lr]::
30205::$$$message_0241_0100_0012$$$::I leave the dojo and follow after the two.::
30206::$$$message_0241_0100_0013$$$::   Tohsaka's there and Saber's there.[lr]::
30207::$$$message_0241_0100_0014$$$::Tohsaka's not one to stay put, and Saber has a competitive spirit, so I'm sure they will go anywhere.[lr]::
30208::$$$message_0241_0100_0015$$$::It's obvious that these hectic days, which would even tire my old man, will continue as long as the three of us are together.::
30209::$$$message_0241_0101_0000$$$::There was a determined future, and a future that I'm walking towards.[lr]::
30210::$$$message_0241_0101_0001$$$::Even if the day comes where I'm able to reach the place where he stood...[lr]::
30211::$$$message_0241_0101_0002$$$::It's possible that there's a different future that awaits me if there will be bright days like this.::
30212::$$$message_0241_0102_0000$$$::The sun has risen already.[lr]::
30213::$$$message_0241_0102_0001$$$::For the things I can't change by myself, if it's the two of us I think we can change them a little bit.::
30214::$$$message_0241_0103_0000$$$::  I have just started walking down the path.[lr]::
30215::$$$message_0241_0103_0001$$$::At my own pace, I'll walk on with my reliable partner...::Ÿ°
