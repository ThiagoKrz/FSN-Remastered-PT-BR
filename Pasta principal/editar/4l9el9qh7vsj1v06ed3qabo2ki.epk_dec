10179::$$$message_0101_0000_0001$$$::I won't be a part of that.[lr]::
10180::$$$message_0101_0000_0002$$$::Actually, I can't.[lr]::
10181::$$$message_0101_0000_0003$$$::If Shinji really wanted to protect himself, he would have asked Tohsaka too. Not just me.[lr]::
10182::$$$message_0101_0000_0004$$$::Besides...::
10183::$$$message_0101_0001_0000$$$::"Shinji. Do you know there's someone overseeing this Holy Grail War?"::
10184::$$$message_0101_0002_0000$$$::"Yeah. The priest at the church, right? I heard he was a survivor of the previous war, but I haven't met him. He seems annoying.[lr]::
10185::$$$message_0101_0002_0001$$$::I'm not a mage, so I don't want anyone to push their rules on me."::
10186::$$$message_0101_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
10187::$$$message_0101_0003_0001$$$::Shinji's contradicting himself.[lr]::
10188::$$$message_0101_0003_0002$$$::If he really wanted to stop fighting, he should've gone straight to Kotomine.::
10189::$$$message_0101_0004_0000$$$::"Shinji, did you know there's a Bounded Field set up over the school?"[lr]::
10190::$$$message_0101_0004_0001$$$::"Yep. I didn't notice, but Rider told me. What about it?"::
10191::$$$message_0101_0005_0000$$$::"Isn't it your doing? Tohsaka said it was the work of a Master at school."::
10192::$$$message_0101_0006_0000$$$::"Oh. Well, it's not me. I know there's another Master at our school, so it's probably them."[lr]::
10193::$$$message_0101_0006_0001$$$::"Huh? Tohsaka said there's only one other Master."::
10194::$$$message_0101_0007_0000$$$::"I wouldn't recommend just blindly trusting Tohsaka. Either way, she's wrong.[lr]::
10195::$$$message_0101_0007_0001$$$::Tohsaka's trying to trace Masters by sensing their Magic Circuits, right?[lr]::
10196::$$$message_0101_0007_0002$$$::If so, I wouldn't be one of the Masters she could detect, since I don't have Magic Circuits to begin with.[lr]::
10197::$$$message_0101_0007_0003$$$::From the very beginning, I wouldn't even be a blip on the other Masters' radars."::
10198::$$$message_0101_0008_0000$$$::...I see.[lr]::
10199::$$$message_0101_0008_0001$$$::The presence of mages or Command Spells ultimately activates through magical energy.::
10200::$$$message_0101_0009_0000$$$::But if someone without magical energy becomes a Master, the only way to identify them would be seeing them directly.[lr]::
10201::$$$message_0101_0009_0001$$$::Tohsaka's method of seeking out people with their own magical energy wouldn't lead her to Masters like Shinji.[lr]::
10202::$$$message_0101_0009_0002$$$::Shinji doesn't have a single one of the traits Tohsaka is expecting in a Master.::
10203::$$$message_0101_0010_0000$$$::"I see. So Tohsaka must be sensing a different Master."[lr]::
10204::$$$message_0101_0010_0001$$$::I should warn Tohsaka about this when I get home.[lr]::
10205::$$$message_0101_0010_0002$$$::With that settled, there's no point in me staying here any longer.::
10206::$$$message_0101_0011_0000$$$::"Hey Emiya! What about our partnership?"::
10207::$$$message_0101_0012_0000$$$::"I'll have to refuse. I'm not going to help you defeat Tohsaka.[lr]::
10208::$$$message_0101_0012_0001$$$::Besides, she hasn't done anything.[lr]::
10209::$$$message_0101_0012_0002$$$::I know I'll have to...fight her one day, but I trust her right now, and I want to keep on trusting her."::
10210::$$$message_0101_0013_0000$$$::"Hmph. When something does happen, it'll be too late. But if that's how you feel, I'm not gonna push it. I'll wait it out and see, just like you."::
10211::$$$message_0101_0014_0000$$$::Surprisingly, Shinji gives up.[lr]::
10212::$$$message_0101_0014_0001$$$::He doesn't try to stop me from going home and he doesn't send Rider to attack me.::
10213::$$$message_0101_0015_0000$$$::Shinji really is a complicated guy.[lr]::
10214::$$$message_0101_0015_0001$$$::He may act like a jerk, but he seems to try to play fair in his own way.::
10215::$$$message_0101_0016_0000$$$::"Hey Shinji. I know I'm harping on this, but does Sakura know about you?"::
10216::$$$message_0101_0017_0000$$$::"She doesn't, and I don't intend on telling her. I'm the heir of the Matou family. Sakura can just remain my little sister and be none the wiser."::
10217::$$$message_0101_0018_0000$$$::"That would be great. I don't want Sakura's life to change."::
10218::$$$message_0101_0019_0000$$$::"Ha."[lr]::
10219::$$$message_0101_0019_0001$$$::"Fine. Since I'm her big brother, I should be thanking you for being so concerned about Sakura. Okay. Let me tell you something good, Emiya.[lr]::
10220::$$$message_0101_0019_0002$$$::I don't know who it is, but one of the Masters has set up a nest for themselves in the temple."::
10221::$$$message_0101_0020_0000$$$::"What!? The temple? You mean Ryudou Temple!?"[lr]::
10222::$$$message_0101_0020_0001$$$::"Yeah. According to my Servant, there's a witch living in the mountains. She's supposedly collecting a bunch of souls, so things are going to get ugly if nobody does anything about her."::
10223::$$$message_0101_0021_0000$$$::"Wha...!"[lr]::
10224::$$$message_0101_0021_0001$$$::If that's true, that makes five Masters.[lr]::
10225::$$$message_0101_0021_0002$$$::And if this witch is collecting a massive amount of souls, there's a high probability it's the cause of what came up in the news this morning.::
10226::$$$message_0101_0022_0000$$$::"That's all I've got for you.[lr]::
10227::$$$message_0101_0022_0001$$$::Rider, see him out. You're not to harm Emiya, since he's on our side."[lr]::
10228::$$$message_0101_0022_0002$$$::Shinji orders Rider, and she walks closer to me.::
10229::$$$message_0101_0023_0000$$$::"No...well, that's..."::
10230::$$$message_0101_0024_0000$$$::"Don't worry about it. I'm responsible for your safety as long as you're in my house. It wouldn't do for you to get hurt or anything like that.[lr]::
10231::$$$message_0101_0024_0001$$$::Oh, Rider. You only have to see him as far as the front door. Once he's out of the house, he's not my concern. But treat him well until then."[lr]::
10232::$$$message_0101_0024_0002$$$::Shinji retreats to the back room.::
10233::$$$message_0101_0025_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
10234::$$$message_0101_0025_0001$$$::I silently look towards Rider.::
10235::$$$message_0101_0026_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
10236::$$$message_0101_0026_0001$$$::The black-garbed Rider says nothing.[lr]::
10237::$$$message_0101_0026_0002$$$::What surprises me though, is that when I take a closer look, I notice she has a graceful and innocent-looking face.::
10238::$$$message_0101_0027_0000$$$::Her floor-length purple hair exudes a foul odor of blood, but at the same time, she is unbelievably beautiful.[lr]::
10239::$$$message_0101_0027_0001$$$::...Er, I realize I'm staring because of her appearance, and I'm embarrassed for a moment, but I feel like her face and her outfit just don't match at all.::
10240::$$$message_0101_0028_0000$$$::If I had to boil her down to a single phrase... She's like a priestess dripping in blood.[lr]::
10241::$$$message_0101_0028_0001$$$::She is both holy and evil... Rider is a walking contradiction.::
10242::$$$message_0101_0029_0000$$$::"Actually..."[lr]::
10243::$$$message_0101_0029_0001$$$::Why are all Heroic Spirits so beautiful?[lr]::
10244::$$$message_0101_0029_0002$$$::As I think this, I find myself looking up at Rider's face out of sheer curiosi[line2]wow she's pretty tall for a woman.[lr]::
10245::$$$message_0101_0029_0003$$$::She's easily a hundred seventy centimeters tall.::
10246::$$$message_0101_0030_0000$$$::"...Hm."[lr]::
10247::$$$message_0101_0030_0001$$$::This really isn't the time for calm observation.[lr]::
10248::$$$message_0101_0030_0002$$$::Being alone with her is a problem in itself. I should hurry out of the Matou mansion.::
10249::$$$message_0101_0031_0000$$$::Rider sticks with me all the way to the entrance.[lr]::
10250::$$$message_0101_0031_0001$$$::I don't know about this...[lr]::
10251::$$$message_0101_0031_0002$$$::She doesn't even seem alive, but maybe she'll answer if I try talking to her.[lr]:•Y
