11272::$$$message_0113_0000_0000$$$::The blades cross.[lr]::
11273::$$$message_0113_0000_0001$$$::The edges of both swords come into contact again and again.[lr]::
11274::$$$message_0113_0000_0002$$$::Stroke after stroke.[lr]::
11275::$$$message_0113_0000_0003$$$::Sword and katana alike spark as they strike and parry.::
11276::$$$message_0113_0001_0000$$$::Several dozen exchanges like this later, and neither opponent has changed position.[lr]::
11277::$$$message_0113_0001_0001$$$::Assassin, standing higher on the steps, holds his ground.[lr]::
11278::$$$message_0113_0001_0002$$$::Saber, who is trying to advance up the stone steps, can't get any closer to Assassin. Over time, she bleeds more and more energy.::
11279::$$$message_0113_0002_0000$$$::"Hah!"[lr]::
11280::$$$message_0113_0002_0001$$$::One of Saber's many attempts at rushing in.[lr]::
11281::$$$message_0113_0002_0002$$$::Assassin effortlessly swings his long blade[line2]fully a meter and a half[line2]and halts Saber's advance.::
11282::$$$message_0113_0003_0000$$$::No, he's not simply preventing an advance.[lr]::
11283::$$$message_0113_0003_0001$$$::If Saber's blade is lightning, Assassin's katana is a hurricane.[lr]::
11284::$$$message_0113_0003_0002$$$::Though Assassin may be no match for her in strength or speed, the flexible trajectory of his blade sweeps aside Saber's every attack.[lr]::
11285::$$$message_0113_0003_0003$$$::The ricocheting katana gains speed and flips back toward Saber's neck like a gust a wind.::
11286::$$$message_0113_0004_0000$$$::Even as Saber dodges the blow by only a hairbreadth, the long katana flicks back toward her, giving her not a moment's rest.[lr]::
11287::$$$message_0113_0004_0001$$$::In contrast to Saber's straight sword, Assassin's blade is curved.[lr]::
11288::$$$message_0113_0004_0002$$$::Assassin's cutting edge is graceful, but it also draws a long extended arc.[lr]::
11289::$$$message_0113_0004_0003$$$::He shouldn't be able to match Saber's sword as it moves in a straight line, but he somehow cancels out that difference.::
11290::$$$message_0113_0005_0000$$$::"Kngh...!"[lr]::
11291::$$$message_0113_0005_0001$$$::She suddenly stops.[lr]::
11292::$$$message_0113_0005_0002$$$::Her blade isn't moving fast enough to block Assassin's counter-attack.[lr]::
11293::$$$message_0113_0005_0003$$$::She falls back a pace, knowing it's the only way she can avoid the incoming strike.::
11294::$$$message_0113_0006_0000$$$::Assassin's katana traces a fascinatingly beautiful arc, but at the same time it is so fast that it's nearly impossible to follow.[lr]::
11295::$$$message_0113_0006_0001$$$::Is this seeming impossibility owed to Assassin's skill, or is it owed instead to Saber being at a disadvantageous position in their battle?[lr]::
11296::$$$message_0113_0006_0002$$$::Unable to reach a clear conclusion, Saber continues dodging Assassin's strikes, and turns aside the blade as it arcs toward her neck with her own weapon.::
11297::$$$message_0113_0007_0000$$$::"...Ngh!"[lr]::
11298::$$$message_0113_0007_0001$$$::The next thing she knows, she has retreated a few more steps down the stairs.[lr]::
11299::$$$message_0113_0007_0002$$$::That's the extent of his long katana's reach.[lr]::
11300::$$$message_0113_0007_0003$$$::It would be easy to rush up close to him once she sweeps his sword aside, but for some reason, she just can't do it.::
11301::$$$message_0113_0008_0000$$$::It must be owed to the enemy's superb skills and her own position below him, which puts her at a disadvantage.[lr]::
11302::$$$message_0113_0008_0001$$$::Saber bites her lip, thinking she wouldn't have such a hard time against that long katana if they were on flat ground.::
11303::$$$message_0113_0009_0000$$$::"This is certainly a problem. I had not expected fighting against an invisible blade would be so challenging."[lr]::
11304::$$$message_0113_0009_0001$$$::Assassin is unmoved.[lr]::
11305::$$$message_0113_0009_0002$$$::He is fighting purely to defend.[lr]::
11306::$$$message_0113_0009_0003$$$::He need not chase after a retreating Saber, nor does he have any reason to give up the advantage of higher ground.::
11307::$$$message_0113_0010_0000$$$::"Hm. This must be the first time you have seen a katana, yes?[lr]::
11308::$$$message_0113_0010_0001$$$::My sword is quite wicked. An ordinary opponent would fall to but a single blow. You, on the other hand, have evaded it spectacularly. This pleases me, Saber."::
11309::$$$message_0113_0011_0000$$$::"Additionally, your cut-in technique is marvelous. You are able to do so much with that small frame of yours. You must be impeccably trained."[lr]::
11310::$$$message_0113_0011_0001$$$::Assassin watches Saber, his posture relaxed, perhaps simply because he needn't go on the offensive.::
11311::$$$message_0113_0012_0000$$$::The tip of his blade wavers, losing strength.[lr]::
11312::$$$message_0113_0012_0001$$$::But Saber cannot seize the opportunity.[lr]::
11313::$$$message_0113_0012_0002$$$::The man is not holding a stance.[lr]::
11314::$$$message_0113_0012_0003$$$::A long katana like that can only be wielded as long the wielder is able to swing the sword from any position. ::
11315::$$$message_0113_0013_0000$$$::"Is something the matter? Surely you are not done. That invisible sword is not simply for show, is it?"[lr]::
11316::$$$message_0113_0013_0001$$$::"Hmph! You do not know when to stop talking!"::
11317::$$$message_0113_0014_0000$$$::The sword and katana clash.[lr]::
11318::$$$message_0113_0014_0001$$$::"Ah, I have you now!"[lr]::
11319::$$$message_0113_0014_0002$$$::The longsword stops mid-swing.[lr]::
11320::$$$message_0113_0014_0003$$$::Assassin grins, glancing at his katana where it stopped the invisible sword, then parries again...[lr]::
11321::$$$message_0113_0014_0004$$$::...while Saber catches the flash coming at her neck.::
11322::$$$message_0113_0015_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
11323::$$$message_0113_0015_0001$$$::Even Saber knows.[lr]::
11324::$$$message_0113_0015_0002$$$::She's been able to block Assassin's unfamiliar sword work thanks to her invisible sword.[lr]::
11325::$$$message_0113_0015_0003$$$::Her invisible sword can confuse the opponent's senses, both offensively and defensively.::
11326::$$$message_0113_0016_0000$$$::Assassin not following through on his attacks is proof of this.[lr]::
11327::$$$message_0113_0016_0001$$$::Not knowing how long Saber's sword is makes it too dangerous for Assassin to close in on her.[lr]::
11328::$$$message_0113_0016_0002$$$::If Assassin were to step in to attack Saber, he will do so when[line2]::
11329::$$$message_0113_0017_0000$$$::"Hah...!"[lr]::
11330::$$$message_0113_0017_0001$$$::When Saber tries to smash Assassin's forehead.[lr]::
11331::$$$message_0113_0017_0002$$$::That attack...[lr]::
11332::$$$message_0113_0017_0003$$$::Assassin dodges it completely as he takes just a step back.::
11333::$$$message_0113_0018_0000$$$::"Ah. I have a good idea of its length now. It is roughly three [font italic=true]shaku[font italic=false] (ninety centimeters) long and four [font italic=true]sun[font italic=false] (twelve centimeters) wide. Its shape...let's see, as befits your name, is that of a typical Western sword."[lr]::
11334::$$$message_0113_0018_0001$$$::Assassin may have spoken calmly, but his exceptional skill at appraising the blade is clear.[lr]::
11335::$$$message_0113_0018_0002$$$::Saber's strike had been so fast that, even were her sword visible, it would have been almost impossible to see.[lr]::
11336::$$$message_0113_0018_0003$$$::And yet, not only has he managed to defend himself from the invisible blade, he's also figured out its size and shape.::
11337::$$$message_0113_0019_0000$$$::"I cannot believe it. You have measured my sword without employing any magecraft or having a satisfying exchange with our blades."::
11338::$$$message_0113_0020_0000$$$::"Surprised? However this is but the trick of a mere street performer, in my opinion. As a wielder of a wicked sword, such tricks are the only things I get to practice."::
11339::$$$message_0113_0021_0000$$$::"I see. Your strategy was to simply parry my strikes to avoid being wounded. I can see now why a coward like you would call himself a wicked swordsman."::
11340::$$$message_0113_0022_0000$$$::"Ha...ah, well you must forgive me for not properly trading blows with you.[lr]::
11341::$$$message_0113_0022_0001$$$::You see, I have this long katana. Were I to properly lock blades with you, it would certainly break. You must be the sort to go all out, but I cannot. I am unable to put my full might into every strike with this katana."::
11342::$$$message_0113_0023_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
11343::$$$message_0113_0023_0001$$$::"So it has always been with the katana.[lr]::
11344::$$$message_0113_0023_0002$$$::Western swords cut with sheer weight and power.[lr]::
11345::$$$message_0113_0023_0003$$$::Our blades, however, rely upon speed and technique.[lr]::
11346::$$$message_0113_0023_0004$$$::Do you now see how different our fighting styles are?"::
11347::$$$message_0113_0024_0000$$$::"But then again...it would be disappointing to leave matters like this.[lr]::
11348::$$$message_0113_0024_0001$$$::Now, Saber. I believe the time has come to stop concealing your true power."[lr]::
11349::$$$message_0113_0024_0002$$$::"Assassin. Do you believe I am taking it easy on you?"[lr]::
11350::$$$message_0113_0024_0003$$$::"Are you saying you are not? I do not know what your intentions are, but for you to fight with your sheath on is somewhat insulting. Do you believe that I am unworthy of being taken seriously as your opponent?"::
11351::$$$message_0113_0025_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
11352::$$$message_0113_0025_0001$$$::"Ah, you do not seem as though you intend to comply.[lr]::
11353::$$$message_0113_0025_0002$$$::Very well. If you decline to reveal your own, then I shall show you my secret technique first."[lr]::
11354::$$$message_0113_0025_0003$$$::And with that...[lr]::
11355::$$$message_0113_0025_0004$$$::...the swordsman with the long katana drifts down next to Saber.::
11356::$$$message_0113_0026_0000$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
11357::$$$message_0113_0026_0001$$$::For an Assassin to give up his advantageous position is as good as inviting defeat.[lr]::
11358::$$$message_0113_0026_0002$$$::He may be a superb swordsman, but it was the landscape of their battleground that gave him the advantage.::
11359::$$$message_0113_0027_0000$$$::If the two are to fight on level ground, Saber should have no trouble repelling Assassin's attack and taking his head then and there.[lr]::
11360::$$$message_0113_0027_0001$$$::Assassin should know this as well.[lr]::
11361::$$$message_0113_0027_0002$$$::So, why...?::
11362::$$$message_0113_0028_0000$$$::"Brace yourself. Or you will die, Saber."[lr]::
11363::$$$message_0113_0028_0001$$$::Saber instinctively reacts to the smoothness in his voice.[lr]::
11364::$$$message_0113_0028_0002$$$::    For he is speaking the truth.[lr]::
11365::$$$message_0113_0028_0003$$$::Assassin descending the steps has not put her in an advantageous position.[lr]::
11366::$$$message_0113_0028_0004$$$::Her intuition, which has enabled her to triumph in so many battles, warns her of her mistake.::
11367::$$$message_0113_0029_0000$$$::"Ku...gh!"[lr]::
11368::$$$message_0113_0029_0001$$$::She readies her invisible sword.[lr]::
11369::$$$message_0113_0029_0002$$$::There's no room to hesitate.[lr]::
11370::$$$message_0113_0029_0003$$$::What matters is that she has to attack with her sword before Assassin swings his long katana.::
11371::$$$message_0113_0030_0000$$$::"Fu...!"[lr]::
11372::$$$message_0113_0030_0001$$$::Roughly three meters separates the two.[lr]::
11373::$$$message_0113_0030_0002$$$::His readies himself...[lr]::
11374::$$$message_0113_0030_0003$$$::The stance he takes now is one he has not taken in their battle so far.::
11375::$$$message_0113_0031_0000$$$::"Secret technique..."[lr]::
11376::$$$message_0113_0031_0001$$$::Saber charges.[lr]::
11377::$$$message_0113_0031_0002$$$::The long katana is meaningless now.[lr]::
11378::$$$message_0113_0031_0003$$$::The moment she draws near Assassin, the katana will become a liability to him.[lr]::
11379::$$$message_0113_0031_0004$$$::And yet...[lr]::
11380::$$$message_0113_0031_0005$$$::"Swallow Reversal."[lr]::
11381::$$$message_0113_0031_0006$$$::Such logic means little to a swordsman like him.::
11382::$$$message_0113_0032_0000$$$::Lightning strikes.[lr]::
11383::$$$message_0113_0032_0001$$$::Faster even than Saber's blade, the demonic blow strikes down in a single straight line...::
11384::$$$message_0113_0033_0000$$$::"...Ngh!"[lr]::
11385::$$$message_0113_0033_0001$$$::But it's not as if Saber cannot block such an attack.[lr]::
11386::$$$message_0113_0033_0002$$$::She quickly raises her sword to defend, repelling Assassin's attack...::
11387::$$$message_0113_0034_0000$$$::"I got you!"[lr]::
11388::$$$message_0113_0034_0001$$$::Even Assassin will be left open after an attack like that is turned aside.[lr]::
11389::$$$message_0113_0034_0002$$$::In that split-second interval, as Saber attempts to cut through Assassin's stomach...[lr]::
11390::$$$message_0113_0034_0003$$$::"...Ah!"[lr]::
11391::$$$message_0113_0034_0004$$$::Swiftly, trusting in her instincts, Saber rolls down the stone steps.::
11392::$$$message_0113_0035_0000$$$::She rolls away as if she's fleeing.[lr]::
11393::$$$message_0113_0035_0001$$$::She makes no effort even to soften her landing.[lr]::
11394::$$$message_0113_0035_0002$$$::All Saber does is frantically hurl herself down the stairs, slowing for nothing.::
11395::$$$message_0113_0036_0000$$$::"Kn...!"[lr]::
11396::$$$message_0113_0036_0001$$$::Saber stops rolling and gets to her feet.[lr]::
11397::$$$message_0113_0036_0002$$$::Above her on the stairs, she sees the swordsman standing at his ease.::
11398::$$$message_0113_0037_0000$$$::"Ah. You managed to evade my secret technique. I should expect no less, Saber. You are far and away the superior of a swallow."::
11399::$$$message_0113_0038_0000$$$::"I cannot believe it. That was..."[lr]::
11400::$$$message_0113_0038_0001$$$::"Ah, it is nothing to be impressed by. It's something I thought up when I considered how to slay a swallow."[lr]::
11401::$$$message_0113_0038_0002$$$::He raises his long katana up high.[lr]::
11402::$$$message_0113_0038_0003$$$::The motion is done as if to mimic the demonic sword's motions he demonstrated earlier to intimidate Saber.::
11403::$$$message_0113_0039_0000$$$::"Can you see this, Saber?[lr]::
11404::$$$message_0113_0039_0001$$$::Swallows avoid attacks by trying to catch the wind. Fast or slow, it does not matter. A sword always disturbs the atmosphere, no matter what sort it might be. Swallows feel that tremor and react by changing the direction in which they are flying.[lr]::
11405::$$$message_0113_0039_0002$$$::And so, no attack can slay a swallow. A sword can only move along a single line; it cannot catch a swallow, which can fly through the air in all directions."::
11406::$$$message_0113_0040_0000$$$::"So your only option is to deny them any path of escape.[lr]::
11407::$$$message_0113_0040_0001$$$::The first sword attacks the swallow, and the second sword surrounds the escaping swallow as it reads those movements.[lr]::
11408::$$$message_0113_0040_0002$$$::But they are fast. Long as this katana is, the second sword will surely not reach the swallow in time. If I hope to capture the swallow, I would need to strike with the second sword at the very same instant as the first. But such is well beyond human ability.[lr]::
11409::$$$message_0113_0040_0003$$$::I accepted the truth of this impossibility. However...::
11410::$$$message_0113_0041_0000$$$::Unfortunately for you, I had nothing better to do with my time.[lr]::
11411::$$$message_0113_0041_0001$$$::They say determination is the key to success, and the next thing I knew, I had managed it.[lr]::
11412::$$$message_0113_0041_0002$$$::A simple, worthless idea like killing a swallow became a secret technique that created a prison by employing multiple simultaneous strikes of the sword."::
11413::$$$message_0113_0042_0000$$$::Saber cannot help but disagree with his matter-of-fact narrative.[lr]::
11414::$$$message_0113_0042_0001$$$::It is untrue.[lr]::
11415::$$$message_0113_0042_0002$$$::His technique is not as simple as he claims.[lr]::
11416::$$$message_0113_0042_0003$$$::Execute two attacks simultaneously? Impossible.[lr]::
11417::$$$message_0113_0042_0004$$$::The two blades struck at exactly the same time.[lr]::
11418::$$$message_0113_0042_0005$$$::In that moment, there existed two separate katana.::
11419::$$$message_0113_0043_0000$$$::"Kischur Zelretch... A multi-dimensional refraction phenomenon... A Servant whose skills reached the level of a Noble Phantasm without using magecraft, but by skill alone..."[lr]::
11420::$$$message_0113_0043_0001$$$::It is most certainly to be admired.[lr]::
11421::$$$message_0113_0043_0002$$$::That single blow made it very clear.[lr]::
11422::$$$message_0113_0043_0003$$$::Sasaki Kojirou does not possess a Noble Phantasm as Heroic Spirits typically do.[lr]::
11423::$$$message_0113_0043_0004$$$::All he has is his magical sword and its sheer power, reaching the realm of the gods.[lr]::
11424::$$$message_0113_0043_0005$$$::What's astonishing is that this man, a mere human, has managed to stand on equal ground with a Heroic Spirit who possesses a Noble Phantasm!::
11425::$$$message_0113_0044_0000$$$::"But my footing was bad. My Swallow Reversal typically employs three slices. If I had more room, I could have added my horizontal slash."[lr]::
11426::$$$message_0113_0044_0001$$$::"I would assume so. Otherwise the attack would be incomplete.[lr]::
11427::$$$message_0113_0044_0002$$$::If everything were to happen at the same time, the second sword's trajectory would naturally slow down. To compensate, there must be a third horizontal attack to prevent the opponent from escaping to the side."::
11428::$$$message_0113_0045_0000$$$::"Ah, a quick study indeed. No wonder you managed to evade my secret technique.[lr]::
11429::$$$message_0113_0045_0001$$$::Heh...how wonderful, Saber![lr]::
11430::$$$message_0113_0045_0002$$$::I had so cursed my summoning to this material world, but that lament ends tonight. An opportunity to face an opponent that would have been impossible in my lifetime, and a chance to use my secret attack on them is enough to make this summoning well worth it."::
11431::$$$message_0113_0046_0000$$$::Assassin readies his sword again, and descends the stone steps.[lr]::
11432::$$$message_0113_0046_0001$$$::He must be after Saber's head.[lr]::
11433::$$$message_0113_0046_0002$$$::Saber is not confident is she will be able to dodge that secret technique again.[lr]::
11434::$$$message_0113_0046_0003$$$::Like Lancer's Gáe Bolg, Assassin's Swallow Reversal is a technique that one cannot allow the wielder to use.::
11435::$$$message_0113_0047_0000$$$::Except, unlike Gáe Bolg, against which one can defend once they understand what it is and know that it will strike at the heart, there is no defense against Assassin's secret technique. It cannot be evaded, even when one knows what it is.[lr]::
11436::$$$message_0113_0047_0001$$$::If there is a defense, it lies in preventing him from using the attack.[lr]::
11437::$$$message_0113_0047_0002$$$::The only way to defeat him is to deliver a devastating blow before Assassin can unleash his secret technique.::
11438::$$$message_0113_0048_0000$$$::"I see. I should not have taken it so easy on you."[lr]::
11439::$$$message_0113_0048_0001$$$::She lowers both her hands.[lr]::
11440::$$$message_0113_0048_0002$$$::Saber drops the tip of her invisible sword as if driving it into the ground, and glares up at Assassin as he approaches.[lr]::
11441::$$$message_0113_0048_0003$$$::"Oh? So are you finally resolved to go all out, Saber?"::
11442::$$$message_0113_0049_0000$$$::Assassin stops descending the steps and readies his secret technique once more.[lr]::
11443::$$$message_0113_0049_0001$$$::Saber looks at him bravely...[lr]::
11444::$$$message_0113_0049_0002$$$::"I too have no complaints.[lr]::
11445::$$$message_0113_0049_0003$$$::Will you be able to endure my attack, Assassin!?"[lr]::
11446::$$$message_0113_0049_0004$$$::Saber releases her own restraints.::
11447::$$$message_0113_0050_0000$$$::The air trembles.[lr]::
11448::$$$message_0113_0050_0001$$$::As if responding to her will, her sword releases a torrential gust of wind.::
11449::$$$message_0113_0051_0000$$$::"Hnngh!?"[lr]::
11450::$$$message_0113_0051_0001$$$::Assassin retreats several steps.[lr]::
11451::$$$message_0113_0051_0002$$$::The gale force winds released from Saber's sword are extraordinary.[lr]::
11452::$$$message_0113_0051_0003$$$::Even the thick trees on either side of the temple gates creak and groan.::
11453::$$$message_0113_0052_0000$$$::So strong is the wind, it all but explodes outward from her blade.[lr]::
11454::$$$message_0113_0052_0001$$$::The atmosphere sealed within is released and roars outward in all directions.[lr]::
11455::$$$message_0113_0052_0002$$$::Saber's sword releases a gust of wind that could easily carry off a human being.::
11456::$$$message_0113_0053_0000$$$::This is her blade's power.[lr]::
11457::$$$message_0113_0053_0001$$$::The Invisible Air is, as the name implies, a sword that has sealed up wind. [lr]::
11458::$$$message_0113_0053_0002$$$::The sword, sheathed in compressed wind, reflects and refracts light to give it the appearance of being invisible.[lr]::
11459::$$$message_0113_0053_0003$$$::This is what happens when the wind is released.[lr]::
11460::$$$message_0113_0053_0004$$$::The released air seeks escape, and dissipates into its surroundings in chaotic gusts.::
11461::$$$message_0113_0054_0000$$$::   During that time...[lr]::
11462::$$$message_0113_0054_0001$$$::Her sword's commanding magecraft allows her to freely manipulate the raging wind.[lr]::
11463::$$$message_0113_0054_0002$$$::As Saber possesses incredible amounts of magical energy, she should be able to maintain the Bounded Field for a few minutes.[lr]::
11464::$$$message_0113_0054_0003$$$::The truth of this is made apparent by the fact that her sword, even after releasing so much energy, remains invisible.::
11465::$$$message_0113_0055_0000$$$::"Hmph. This is like a typhoon. However..."[lr]::
11466::$$$message_0113_0055_0001$$$::The howling winds do not die down.[lr]::
11467::$$$message_0113_0055_0002$$$::The unleashed winds are about to engulf Assassin.::
11468::$$$message_0113_0056_0000$$$::"This cannot be all of it. I shall see every skill you have concealed, Saber!!!"[lr]::
11469::$$$message_0113_0056_0001$$$::Assassin closes in, despite the raging, blinding wind.[lr]::
11470::$$$message_0113_0056_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
11471::$$$message_0113_0056_0003$$$::Saber's arm moves.[lr]::
11472::$$$message_0113_0056_0004$$$::The wind-infused blade roars, readying itself to intercept Assassin, who advances calmly, slowly in spite of the gale force winds, strong enough prevent most people from even approaching[line2]::
