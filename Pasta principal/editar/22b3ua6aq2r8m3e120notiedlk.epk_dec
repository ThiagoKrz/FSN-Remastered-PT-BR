42764::$$$message_0377_0000_0001$$$::It's not just an unexpected intrusion.[lr]::
42765::$$$message_0377_0000_0002$$$::Tohsaka and Archer, Caster and Kuzuki. If their powers are equal, then even I can be of help.::
42766::$$$message_0377_0001_0000$$$::I can let Archer take care of Caster, so if I can stop Kuzuki even a little, Tohsaka can shoot him from a distance...!::

42772::$$$message_0377_0003_0002$$$::I obviously subdued the pain from my wound.[lr]::
42773::$$$message_0377_0003_0003$$$::Tohsaka aside, I can't let Caster and the others know that I'm injured.::
42774::$$$message_0377_0004_0000$$$::"Are you serious...!? Why are you here...!?"[lr]::
42775::$$$message_0377_0004_0001$$$::"What are you saying? You're the one who said to go to the church.[lr]::
42776::$$$message_0377_0004_0002$$$::I didn't think I'd come across such a bad situation either."::
42777::$$$message_0377_0005_0000$$$::Tohsaka bites her tongue in spite of herself.[lr]::
42778::$$$message_0377_0005_0001$$$::All right. I said that on a whim, but it seems like I was able to convince Tohsaka more than I expected.::
42779::$$$message_0377_0006_0000$$$::"Anyway, I'm going to help. I should be of use in this situation, right?[lr]::
42780::$$$message_0377_0006_0001$$$::...Complain after we defeat Caster."[lr]::
42781::$$$message_0377_0006_0002$$$::I cautiously approach Kuzuki so that I can protect Tohsaka.::

42786::$$$message_0377_0008_0003$$$::"Caster, this makes three against three. You should have no complaints. Get Saber."[wsay canskip=1]::
42787::$$$message_0377_0009_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::

42792::$$$message_0377_0010_0001$$$::"Yes. That is why I used my Command Spell and ordered her to kill you all. That was my command as her Master. I did not want to use it, but I have to, right?"::
42793::$$$message_0377_0011_0000$$$::...Saber stands up.[lr]::
42794::$$$message_0377_0011_0001$$$::Her body is covered with silver armor, and in her hands is a golden sword that I've never seen before...::
42795::$$$message_0377_0012_0000$$$::"...Good grief, you got me, boy. Now I only have one Command Spell left. This is for my protection, so I cannot force Saber to do things anymore.[lr]::
42796::$$$message_0377_0012_0001$$$::...My plan to make the Holy Grail eternal is now foiled. Now I can only make one wish come true, but..."::
42797::$$$message_0377_0013_0000$$$::"But before that, I shall at least have some fun.[lr]::
42798::$$$message_0377_0013_0001$$$::Now, Saber. Show your true powers to these kids who ruined my wish." ::
42799::$$$message_0377_0014_0000$$$::Saber, holding her golden sword, steps towards us.::
