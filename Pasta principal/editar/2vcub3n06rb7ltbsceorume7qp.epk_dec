1684::$$$message_0015_0000_0000$$$::   I wouldn't want anyone to get sad, if I can help it.[lr]::
1685::$$$message_0015_0000_0001$$$::If I just use my own limited powers to make the people around me happy, the world will be a better place.::
1686::$$$message_0015_0001_0000$$$::That was always Kiritsugu's favorite saying.[lr]::
1687::$$$message_0015_0001_0001$$$::The man who I saw as a champion of justice was saying he thought he was a failure, that he wasn't good enough.::
1688::$$$message_0015_0002_0000$$$::He didn't need to explain it to me.[lr]::
1689::$$$message_0015_0002_0001$$$::The worlds the young me and the grown-up Kiritsugu lived in were too different, and so the standards for being a hero of justice were different too.[lr]::
1690::$$$message_0015_0002_0002$$$::When I was young, this house was my entire world.[lr]::
1691::$$$message_0015_0002_0003$$$::So my old man, Fuji-nee, myself, and my favorite shed were the only things that needed protecting.::
1692::$$$message_0015_0003_0000$$$::All I thought I had to protect was what I could see around me.[lr]::
1693::$$$message_0015_0003_0001$$$::But Kiritsugu wanted to do something for those he couldn't see or reach.::
1694::$$$message_0015_0004_0000$$$::   I was reckless when I was young.[lr]::
1695::$$$message_0015_0004_0001$$$::I built myself up by cursing the cruel world.[lr]::
1696::$$$message_0015_0004_0002$$$::The world was cruel...so I became cruel as a way to make my ideals a reality.::
1697::$$$message_0015_0005_0000$$$::There will always be those that can't be saved.[lr]::
1698::$$$message_0015_0005_0001$$$::You just can't save everything.[lr]::
1699::$$$message_0015_0005_0002$$$::If in the process of trying to save a thousand, you overlook five hundred...[lr]::
1700::$$$message_0015_0005_0003$$$::...then I will abandon one hundred to save nine hundred.[lr]::
1701::$$$message_0015_0005_0004$$$::That is the most efficient way.[lr]::
1702::$$$message_0015_0005_0005$$$::"That is the ideal," Kiritsugu once told me.::
1703::$$$message_0015_0006_0000$$$::Of course I got mad hearing that.[lr]::
1704::$$$message_0015_0006_0001$$$::It really ticked me off.[lr]::
1705::$$$message_0015_0006_0002$$$::Because I didn't have to be told that since I knew that already.[lr]::
1706::$$$message_0015_0006_0003$$$::Because I knew firsthand that it was that very ideal that led to me being saved.::
1707::$$$message_0015_0007_0000$$$::I didn't need to be reminded about something so obvious.[lr]::
1708::$$$message_0015_0007_0001$$$::But I still believed that a hero of justice could save everyone, despite those limitations.[lr]::
1709::$$$message_0015_0007_0002$$$::Because that's what a hero of justice was: someone who could still perform miracles, no matter how idealistic or unattainable they may be.::
1710::$$$message_0015_0008_0000$$$::   You're right, Shirou.[lr]::
1711::$$$message_0015_0008_0001$$$::Results are the most important thing. But apart from that, what's even more important is to have the heart[line2]::
1712::$$$message_0015_0009_0000$$$::   What did Kiritsugu say about heart, again?[lr]::
1713::$$$message_0015_0009_0001$$$::...I don't remember.[lr]::
1714::$$$message_0015_0009_0002$$$::It's not often I reminisce about something from so long ago.[lr]::
1715::$$$message_0015_0009_0003$$$::I must be in a deep sleep.[lr]::
1716::$$$message_0015_0009_0004$$$::Otherwise, I wouldn't be dreaming in the first place.::
1717::$$$message_0015_0010_0000$$$::   Shirou. Wake up. It's almost time for breakfast.::
1718::$$$message_0015_0011_0000$$$::See?[lr]::
1719::$$$message_0015_0011_0001$$$::Saber is waking me up. It's pathetic.::
1720::$$$message_0015_0012_0000$$$::"...What!?"[lr]::
1721::$$$message_0015_0012_0001$$$::I bolt upright and out of my futon.[lr]::
1722::$$$message_0015_0012_0002$$$::It's six-thirty in the morning. Fresh sunlight pours in from outside.[lr]::
1723::$$$message_0015_0012_0003$$$::"Shirou. It is morning. Do you need to prepare breakfast?"[lr]::
1724::$$$message_0015_0012_0004$$$::Saber is staring right at me.::
1725::$$$message_0015_0013_0000$$$::"I overslept. Sorry. I'll get up right away."[lr]::
1726::$$$message_0015_0013_0001$$$::"You have nothing to apologize for, but you have no time to relax. It appears Sakura and Rin were arguing earlier."[lr]::
1727::$$$message_0015_0013_0002$$$::"Sakura and Tohsaka are arguing?"::
1728::$$$message_0015_0014_0000$$$::What's going on?[lr]::
1729::$$$message_0015_0014_0001$$$::Hold on. Don't throw me into a situation I don't understand just as I'm waking up.::
1730::$$$message_0015_0015_0000$$$::"Is that happening in Tohsaka's room?"[lr]::
1731::$$$message_0015_0015_0001$$$::"No, the living room. I just passed by, so I do not know the details."[lr]::
1732::$$$message_0015_0015_0002$$$::"Got it. I'll head there now."::
1733::$$$message_0015_0016_0000$$$::Oh but...[lr]::
1734::$$$message_0015_0016_0001$$$::There's something I forgot to do.[lr]::
1735::$$$message_0015_0016_0002$$$::"What is it, Shirou?"[lr]::
1736::$$$message_0015_0016_0003$$$::"Good morning, Saber. Thanks for waking me."[lr]::
1737::$$$message_0015_0016_0004$$$::I greet her, and then I head out to the hallway.[lr]::
1738::$$$message_0015_0016_0005$$$::...But seriously, what the hell did Tohsaka do to start an argument with Sakura!?::
1739::$$$message_0015_0017_0000$$$::"Tohsaka!"[lr]::
1740::$$$message_0015_0017_0001$$$::In the living room...[lr]::
1741::$$$message_0015_0017_0002$$$::There's no sign of Sakura. Tohsaka is alone, casually watching the weather forecast on TV.::
1742::$$$message_0015_0018_0000$$$::"Morning. What a way to start the morning, shouting my name like that."[lr]::
1743::$$$message_0015_0018_0001$$$::She turns around, as if to ask if something had happened.::
1744::$$$message_0015_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]Huh?[font italic=false][lr]::
1745::$$$message_0015_0019_0001$$$::That's weird. It doesn't look like she was fighting with Sakura at all.::
1746::$$$message_0015_0020_0000$$$::"Uh...morning. Hey, Tohsaka. I heard you and Sakura were arguing. Is that true?"::
1747::$$$message_0015_0021_0000$$$::"Huh? Oh, from Saber.[lr]::
1748::$$$message_0015_0021_0001$$$::Yes, it may have seemed that way, to an outside observer, but it was nothing, really. I just told her not to come here for a while."::
1749::$$$message_0015_0022_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
1750::$$$message_0015_0022_0001$$$::Sh-she's so casual about basically banning Sakura from my house!::
1751::$$$message_0015_0023_0000$$$::"That's ridiculous. Sakura already said no to staying away from this house, so there's no way she would agree even if we asked again[line2]"::
1752::$$$message_0015_0024_0000$$$::"She wouldn't agree, but she went home after I presented her with a compromise. I told her I would go back home without argument if she stays away for a week. She agreed to those terms. She went home, even if she was a little reluctant. Oh right, she sends her regards."::
1753::$$$message_0015_0025_0000$$$::"You did what...?"[lr]::
1754::$$$message_0015_0025_0001$$$::Why would she do something like that without telling me...?[lr]::
1755::$$$message_0015_0025_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
1756::$$$message_0015_0025_0003$$$::Actually, I shouldn't yell at her for it.[lr]::
1757::$$$message_0015_0025_0004$$$::Tohsaka's just done something I should have.::
1758::$$$message_0015_0026_0000$$$::"You're right. Sorry for making you be the bad guy so early in the morning. You must feel terrible, Tohsaka."[lr]::
1759::$$$message_0015_0026_0001$$$::"Huh? No, it wasn't bad or unpleasant to me. Why would you think that, Shirou?"::
1760::$$$message_0015_0027_0000$$$::"Uh, because weren't you and Sakura friends? Telling Sakura to leave not once, but twice, doesn't sound like a fun job.[lr]::
1761::$$$message_0015_0027_0001$$$::That's why I feel bad. I'm the one who should take charge, but I made you do the dirty work again."::
1762::$$$message_0015_0028_0000$$$::"Th-that's fine. I just kicked out Sakura for my own safety. There's no reason for you to apologize."[lr]::
1763::$$$message_0015_0028_0001$$$::"Huh? What do you mean, for your own safety?"::
1764::$$$message_0015_0029_0000$$$::"Well, you said Shinji's a Master, right?[lr]::
1765::$$$message_0015_0029_0001$$$::Knowing him, if Shinji finds out Sakura comes here, he'll target this place, so it's best to keep Sakura away from here until we've finished dealing with Shinji."::
1766::$$$message_0015_0030_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
1767::$$$message_0015_0030_0001$$$::I get it.[lr]::
1768::$$$message_0015_0030_0002$$$::She makes a good point.[lr]::
1769::$$$message_0015_0030_0003$$$::Shinji said he doesn't tell Sakura anything. I don't think he was lying.[lr]::
1770::$$$message_0015_0030_0004$$$::But if he finds out his little sister comes here so often, he might get the wrong idea.::
1771::$$$message_0015_0031_0000$$$::"You're right. It could look to Shinji like we're taking Sakura hostage."::
1772::$$$message_0015_0032_0000$$$::"Exactly. But more importantly, this place is still dangerous.[lr]::
1773::$$$message_0015_0032_0001$$$::I wouldn't want her to be walking around at night, so it's best for her to stay away from here for a while. This is for Sakura's own safety, as well as ours."::
1774::$$$message_0015_0033_0000$$$::"...Yeah, you're right. I feel bad for Sakura, but I'll just have to apologize and ask her forgiveness later."[lr]::
1775::$$$message_0015_0033_0001$$$::Though I won't be able to explain myself even when the time comes.::
1776::$$$message_0015_0034_0000$$$::"...Hnnn."[lr]::
1777::$$$message_0015_0034_0001$$$::This is really getting to me.[lr]::
1778::$$$message_0015_0034_0002$$$::I feel really bad about turning Sakura away like this, even if it's temporary. She's been so unselfish about helping me for all this time.::
1779::$$$message_0015_0035_0000$$$::"Oh, you look really down. What happened to all that energy you had when you shouted at me earlier? Are you all sad and lonely, not having Sakura around?"::
1780::$$$message_0015_0036_0000$$$::Tohsaka grins maliciously.[lr]::
1781::$$$message_0015_0036_0001$$$::Oh crap. I've known she'd tease me whenever I show vulnerability, but I went and did it again.::
1782::$$$message_0015_0037_0000$$$::"Hmph. Leave me alone. Sakura was the symbol of peace at our house. She offset whatever Fuji-nee and I were lacking. So of course I'm down about us sending her away for our own selfish reasons."::
1783::$$$message_0015_0038_0000$$$::"Oh, so you do understand. If you can say that much, then you pass. I'd say you're starting to get more determined."[lr]::
1784::$$$message_0015_0038_0001$$$::"Huh? Wh-what are you trying to say?"::
1785::$$$message_0015_0039_0000$$$::"Don't you get it? Once this war ends, Sakura will come back.[lr]::
1786::$$$message_0015_0039_0001$$$::You say you don't want the Holy Grail, but that just means you should fight to take back the peaceful life you had before. See? Now you have a clear goal."[lr]::
1787::$$$message_0015_0039_0002$$$::Tohsaka smiles her very biggest smile.::
1788::$$$message_0015_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
1789::$$$message_0015_0040_0001$$$::When she puts it like that, I really have no choice but to agree.[lr]::
1790::$$$message_0015_0040_0002$$$::Damn. I don't know what to say.[lr]::
1791::$$$message_0015_0040_0003$$$::What she said there confirms that she's both mean-spirited and ridiculously awesome at the same time.::
1792::$$$message_0015_0041_0000$$$::"What? So Sakura won't be coming here for a while?"[lr]::
1793::$$$message_0015_0041_0001$$$::"Yeah, that's what's going on. Why don't you do your parents a favor and go home once in a while for a change? Gramps was complaining about his daughter neglecting him."::
1794::$$$message_0015_0042_0000$$$::"Leave Dad out of this. He's not going to die or anything, whether I'm there or not.[lr]::
1795::$$$message_0015_0042_0001$$$::And with Sakura gone, I have to be even more vigilant! You're still a boy, so if anything fishy happens here, I'll be the one who gets in trouble and even loses her job. If that happens, are you going to take responsibility, Shirou?"::
1796::$$$message_0015_0043_0000$$$::"That'll never happen[line2]"[lr]::
1797::$$$message_0015_0043_0001$$$::...Sadly, since I'm a man, I can't really confidently deny that...::
1798::$$$message_0015_0044_0000$$$::"Emiya? Why'd you just stop?"[lr]::
1799::$$$message_0015_0044_0001$$$::She glares.[lr]::
1800::$$$message_0015_0044_0002$$$::Tohsaka's eyes bore into me from one side.[lr]::
1801::$$$message_0015_0044_0003$$$::"...I don't think anything would happen. Tohsaka's not staying here for fun, you know.[lr]::
1802::$$$message_0015_0044_0004$$$::I sure know that."::
1803::$$$message_0015_0045_0000$$$::"Good. I'm glad to hear that. Sounds like Emiya is trustworthy, Miss Fujimura."[lr]::
1804::$$$message_0015_0045_0001$$$::"Of course. Even from my point of view, Shirou is really composed. So much so, he might be overdoing it."::
1805::$$$message_0015_0046_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
1806::$$$message_0015_0046_0001$$$::Saber continues to eat in silence as she observes the two interacting.[lr]::
1807::$$$message_0015_0046_0002$$$::It's been two days, but I don't think I'll ever get used to this.::
1808::$$$message_0015_0047_0000$$$::"Oh I forgot to tell you, Shirou. It's about the kyudou club. Did you hear Mitsuzuri got hurt?"[lr]::
1809::$$$message_0015_0047_0001$$$::"Mitsuzuri? Did she pick a fight with someone in another club again? Honestly, she really needs to calm down. She's going to be a third year soon.[lr]::
1810::$$$message_0015_0047_0002$$$::So how's she doing? Is she hurt bad?"::
1811::$$$message_0015_0048_0000$$$::"No, she's fine. She just sprained her ankle. She was apparently attacked by some shady guy on her way home.[lr]::
1812::$$$message_0015_0048_0001$$$::You know she runs fast. She made a mad dash, but it sounds like she fell and got hurt."::
1813::$$$message_0015_0049_0000$$$::"I see. I'm glad nothing bad happened. But honestly, whoever tried to attack her is either a real daredevil, or they're just reckless.[lr]::
1814::$$$message_0015_0049_0001$$$::Either way, they were a fool. I just thought..."[lr]::
1815::$$$message_0015_0049_0002$$$::"You thought she would have knocked the culprit out rather than run?"[lr]::
1816::$$$message_0015_0049_0003$$$::Fuji-nee grins.[lr]::
1817::$$$message_0015_0049_0004$$$::Yep. She sure knows Ayako Mitsuzuri well.::
1818::$$$message_0015_0050_0000$$$::"Yeah. It's rare for Mitsuzuri to run away.[lr]::
1819::$$$message_0015_0050_0001$$$::But I guess she's not so tough against thieves. I suppose things worked out for the best. Something like that will probably teach her a thing or two about being feminine."[lr]::
1820::$$$message_0015_0050_0002$$$::I munch on my rice, nodding approvingly.::
1821::$$$message_0015_0051_0000$$$::"Hey Emiya."[lr]::
1822::$$$message_0015_0051_0001$$$::Suddenly...[lr]::
1823::$$$message_0015_0051_0002$$$::Rin Tohsaka slaps my shoulder, smiling at me.::
1824::$$$message_0015_0052_0000$$$::"I have some news for you."[lr]::
1825::$$$message_0015_0052_0001$$$::"Huh? What? I doubt it'll be more interesting than what I just heard."::
1826::$$$message_0015_0053_0000$$$::"Yeah. I never mentioned this before, but Ayako and I are real good friends. Did you know we're close enough that we hang out on the weekends?"[lr]::
1827::$$$message_0015_0053_0001$$$::    Wait.[lr]::
1828::$$$message_0015_0053_0002$$$::Why are she and Mitsuzuri friends?::
1829::$$$message_0015_0054_0000$$$::"Come again?"[lr]::
1830::$$$message_0015_0054_0001$$$::"Oh, don't worry. I'm going to make sure I tell her every single word you just said. I'm sure if I tell her about how happy Emiya was when he heard about her predicament, why, I bet she'll break ten stacks of tiles from sheer delight!"::
1831::$$$message_0015_0055_0000$$$::"...I...would like to amend my statement. See, it was just a figure of speech. It's not something I'd be proud if people heard, so I would really appreciate if you kept it to yourself."::
1832::$$$message_0015_0056_0000$$$::"Oh really? Well, I [font italic=true]could[font italic=false] keep quiet about it, but it would be reeeally hard for me to do that unless there was, maybe, something in it for me. I might just accidentally slip up, you know?"[lr]::
1833::$$$message_0015_0056_0001$$$::"I can't believe this. Sure, you sound sincere, but I'm not buying it."::
1834::$$$message_0015_0057_0000$$$::"Oh I'm sorry. Don't get me wrong. I'm not playing around here."[lr]::
1835::$$$message_0015_0057_0001$$$::Yeah, there's no misunderstanding here.[lr]::
1836::$$$message_0015_0057_0002$$$::She's enjoying this.::
1837::$$$message_0015_0058_0000$$$::"Got it. I'll start making Western-style breakfasts from now on.[lr]::
1838::$$$message_0015_0058_0001$$$::You said it earlier. You mentioned that breakfast should have bread." ::
1839::$$$message_0015_0059_0000$$$::"Good. And I think some jams, apart from marmalade, would be nice...like strawberry jam."[lr]::
1840::$$$message_0015_0059_0001$$$::"...I don't know what you have against Japanese breakfasts, you foreigner wannabe. I can't believe you would so radically change our breakfast just to suit your needs, you tyrant."::
1841::$$$message_0015_0060_0000$$$::"That is not entirely true. I would also be pleased to have bread served at breakfast. Soft-boiled eggs would also be an excellent addition."[lr]::
1842::$$$message_0015_0060_0001$$$::Saber jumps right into the discussion.::
1843::$$$message_0015_0061_0000$$$::"Is that so? Fine. You all just want Western-style food, dammit. Sakura makes a Western-style breakfast one time and it goes right to your heads.[lr]::
1844::$$$message_0015_0061_0001$$$::Fine then, I'll serve bread for tomorrow, so no more complaints, right? So what was said here, stays here. Don't you dare blab about this to Mitsuzuri."::
1845::$$$message_0015_0062_0000$$$::I huff, and shove rice into my mouth without looking at either of them.[lr]::
1846::$$$message_0015_0062_0001$$$::And then...[lr]::
1847::$$$message_0015_0062_0002$$$::"Why would you be doing something so pointless?"[lr]::
1848::$$$message_0015_0062_0003$$$::Fuji-nee, who had been watching our conversation with a look of wonderment, finally speaks up.::
1849::$$$message_0015_0063_0000$$$::"What, what do you mean, pointless?"[lr]::
1850::$$$message_0015_0063_0001$$$::"Even if Tohsaka isn't going to say anything, I'm going to tell Mitsuzuri anyway. No way would I pass up talking about something so interesting."[lr]::
1851::$$$message_0015_0063_0002$$$::Fuji-nee shakes her head disapprovingly as she eats.[lr]::
1852::$$$message_0015_0063_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
1853::$$$message_0015_0063_0004$$$::Actually.[lr]::
1854::$$$message_0015_0063_0005$$$::I need to think of a way to deal with her, or I'm really in trouble.::
1855::$$$message_0015_0064_0000$$$::Breakfast ends, and it's seven-thirty.[lr]::
1856::$$$message_0015_0064_0001$$$::Fuji-nee surprisingly stays back and suggests that the three of us walk to school.::
1857::$$$message_0015_0065_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
1858::$$$message_0015_0065_0001$$$::...But we can't do that.[lr]::
1859::$$$message_0015_0065_0002$$$::I made a decision last night.[lr]::
1860::$$$message_0015_0065_0003$$$::Now that I've said I won't rely on Saber, I can't afford to take it easy anymore.::
1861::$$$message_0015_0066_0000$$$::"Then let's go. Did you lock up, Shirou?"[lr]::
1862::$$$message_0015_0066_0001$$$::"No, don't worry about locking up. I'm not going to school today."[lr]::
1863::$$$message_0015_0066_0002$$$::I wave Fuji-nee and Tohsaka off.::
1864::$$$message_0015_0067_0000$$$::Fuji-nee freezes, stupefied for just a few seconds.[lr]::
1865::$$$message_0015_0067_0001$$$::"What!? What do you mean you're not going to school!?"[lr]::
1866::$$$message_0015_0067_0002$$$::"Eh, huh?"[lr]::
1867::$$$message_0015_0067_0003$$$::Tohsaka beat Fuji-nee to the chase.::
1868::$$$message_0015_0068_0000$$$::"Th-that's right. You don't look sick enough to miss school today, Shirou."[lr]::
1869::$$$message_0015_0068_0001$$$::"No, but my scar hurts. You know how scars hurt when the weather changes? It's like that."::
1870::$$$message_0015_0069_0000$$$::"Hm... You're lying, Shirou."[lr]::
1871::$$$message_0015_0069_0001$$$::"Yeah, but let me off the hook just for today, Fuji-nee. It's not that I don't like school. There's something I have to do, and it's just more important right now. So let me go."::
1872::$$$message_0015_0070_0000$$$::"...Oh come on, how can I respond if you are going to put it like that? You always were cagey when you had something really important to take care of."[lr]::
1873::$$$message_0015_0070_0001$$$::Fuji-nee is complaining, but at least she understands.::
1874::$$$message_0015_0071_0000$$$::"So there it is. I'll leave the school to you, Tohsaka."[lr]::
1875::$$$message_0015_0071_0001$$$::"O-okay. Not much is going to change just because you're not there. That's not a bad idea, Emiya."::
1876::$$$message_0015_0072_0000$$$::"Yeah, leave the house to me. I'm not going to work for a while either, so I won't be leaving the house much."[lr]::
1877::$$$message_0015_0072_0001$$$::"Got it. Then I'm heading out, Shirou. If you're going to skip school because you're hurt, you shouldn't leave the house much."[lr]::
1878::$$$message_0015_0072_0002$$$::"Well, see you. I'm giving you a pass today, but you're going to have to discuss this with me beforehand next time."::пу
