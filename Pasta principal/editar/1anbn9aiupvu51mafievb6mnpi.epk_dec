36056::$$$message_0301_0000_0000$$$::"Well, I'll go get us some tea. Do you want sugar or milk?"[lr]::
36057::$$$message_0301_0000_0001$$$::"Uh...well, neither for me... Can you tell me one thing before that, Tohsaka?"::
36058::$$$message_0301_0001_0000$$$::"Mm? What is it?"[lr]::
36059::$$$message_0301_0001_0001$$$::"What you were saying earlier. About how there's one other Master and that they're up to something."::
36060::$$$message_0301_0002_0000$$$::"Oh, that? Oh yeah, you wouldn't be able to notice the Bounded Field, huh? ...To put it simply, there's one other Master at school, other than you and I, who's been doing things like we just saw."::
36061::$$$message_0301_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36062::$$$message_0301_0003_0001$$$::...The image of the collapsed female student appears in my mind.[lr]::
36063::$$$message_0301_0003_0002$$$::She was pale, and she would've died if Tohsaka didn't run over to her.::
36064::$$$message_0301_0004_0000$$$::"...So Masters don't only go after other Masters, huh?[lr]::
36065::$$$message_0301_0004_0001$$$::That priest said so, but why would they do such a thing?"::
36066::$$$message_0301_0005_0000$$$::"To win the Holy Grail War, of course. The more Servants eat human spirits, the more magical energy they can store.[lr]::
36067::$$$message_0301_0005_0001$$$::That Master's aim is to try to use all the students as sacrifices and make their Servant stronger."::
36068::$$$message_0301_0006_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]Using the students as sacrifices... Are they insane!?"[lr]::
36069::$$$message_0301_0006_0001$$$::"Who knows? But there's already a Bounded Field set up around school.[lr]::
36070::$$$message_0301_0006_0002$$$::It's not complete, but once it's activated, everyone inside will weaken and die. Although I'm not going to let that happen."::
36071::$$$message_0301_0007_0000$$$::Tohsaka explains in a straightforward manner.[lr]::
36072::$$$message_0301_0007_0001$$$::...This must be something she's known for days.[lr]::
36073::$$$message_0301_0007_0002$$$::That's why she knew what she had to do and went to school, even though she told me not to.[lr]::
36074::$$$message_0301_0007_0003$$$::She knew it's dangerous to be there, but she still went to stop the Master who set up the Bounded Field.::
36075::$$$message_0301_0008_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
36076::$$$message_0301_0008_0001$$$::"Hm?"::
36077::$$$message_0301_0009_0000$$$::...I'm ashamed of myself.[lr]::
36078::$$$message_0301_0009_0001$$$::It's only natural that Tohsaka got irritated seeing me come to school without any thought.[lr]::
36079::$$$message_0301_0009_0002$$$::I wasn't prepared for anything, as I was nonchalantly basking in my everyday life at school.::
36080::$$$message_0301_0010_0000$$$::"Hey. What's wrong? Why are you so down? Did I say something bad...?"[lr]::
36081::$$$message_0301_0010_0001$$$::She looks at me worriedly.[lr]::
36082::$$$message_0301_0010_0002$$$::...I bet she's making weird mental gymnastics again.::
36083::$$$message_0301_0011_0000$$$::"No, you didn't. I was just thinking that I'd never be able to beat you."[lr]::
36084::$$$message_0301_0011_0001$$$::I feel like it's wrong for me to apologize, so I try my best to put my feelings into words.::
36085::$$$message_0301_0012_0000$$$::"...W-what? T-this wasn't about the last fight[line2]"::
36086::$$$message_0301_0013_0000$$$::"I know that. Emiya, do you want to make a truce for now?"[lr]::
36087::$$$message_0301_0013_0001$$$::   Then...[lr]::
36088::$$$message_0301_0013_0002$$$::She made a surprise attack on me with a smile that makes my heart jump.::
36089::$$$message_0301_0014_0000$$$::"You mean...between us?"[lr]::
36090::$$$message_0301_0014_0001$$$::"Yeah. The Master hiding at school is definitely acting out, and they know about you too. I personally want to take care of this Master before you. So do you want to call a truce and look for the other Master together?" ::
36091::$$$message_0301_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36092::$$$message_0301_0015_0001$$$::It takes me aback, but I should consider it carefully.[lr]::
36093::$$$message_0301_0015_0002$$$::No, don't overthink it.[lr]::
36094::$$$message_0301_0015_0003$$$::What Tohsaka is saying is correct, and most of all, I can't ignore this Master.[lr]::
36095::$$$message_0301_0015_0004$$$::First of all, I decided to fight so that I can stop Masters who hurt innocent people.::
36096::$$$message_0301_0016_0000$$$::"What do you think? I don't think it's a bad proposal."[lr]::
36097::$$$message_0301_0016_0001$$$::"Yeah, it's promising if I can get your help."::
36098::$$$message_0301_0017_0000$$$::"Hold on. It doesn't mean I'll be helping you. We just promised on a truce."[lr]::
36099::$$$message_0301_0017_0001$$$::"...I see. So it doesn't mean that an enemy of an enemy is your ally, huh?"::
36100::$$$message_0301_0018_0000$$$::"Nope. But you can trust me until then. I'll have your back as long as you don't betray me."[lr]::
36101::$$$message_0301_0018_0001$$$::She declares.[lr]::
36102::$$$message_0301_0018_0002$$$::This is so like her, and I am genuinely grateful for this good fortune.::
36103::$$$message_0301_0019_0000$$$::"...Then you can count on me. I look forward to working with you, Tohsaka."[lr]::
36104::$$$message_0301_0019_0001$$$::I nod and hold my right arm out.[lr]::
36105::$$$message_0301_0019_0002$$$::"...H-hmph. I'm sure it won't last long, so be useful, okay?"::
36106::$$$message_0301_0020_0000$$$::Tohsaka sounds ungracious.[lr]::
36107::$$$message_0301_0020_0001$$$::But I'm not falling for it.[lr]::
36108::$$$message_0301_0020_0002$$$::For all her bluster, she still takes my hand and gives it a firm shake.::
36109::$$$message_0301_0021_0000$$$::"...I see. No wonder I thought it was strange. So you're not an official successor, huh? Your father passed away before he could pass down the Magic Crest to you, right?"::
36110::$$$message_0301_0022_0000$$$::"I don't know. It seems like my old man had no intention of passing down his Magic Crest to me, and he was against me becoming a mage."[lr]::
36111::$$$message_0301_0022_0001$$$::"Mm? But he taught you magecraft, right? Isn't that contradictory?"::
36112::$$$message_0301_0023_0000$$$::"Maybe. It seemed like he taught me reluctantly since I wouldn't give up. At first, he told me to focus on being a spellcaster rather than a proper mage."::
36113::$$$message_0301_0024_0000$$$::We talk about unimportant stuff for a while.[lr]::
36114::$$$message_0301_0024_0001$$$::"If we're in a truce, I want to know about your family."[lr]::
36115::$$$message_0301_0024_0002$$$::Since Tohsaka asked me that, we started talking about how I learned magecraft.::
36116::$$$message_0301_0025_0000$$$::Kiritsugu Emiya was a lone wolf mage, an outsider to this region.[lr]::
36117::$$$message_0301_0025_0001$$$::By contrast, Tohsaka's family has a prestigious lineage that manages this land.[lr]::
36118::$$$message_0301_0025_0002$$$::Normally, a mage from outside must show some good faith to the mage that keeps the land they stay in, but Kiritsugu didn't do so.[lr]::
36119::$$$message_0301_0025_0003$$$::Actually, he hid the fact that he was a mage.::
36120::$$$message_0301_0026_0000$$$::It seems that as Rin Tohsaka is the head of the Tohsaka family, she is the manager of this area at her young age.[lr]::
36121::$$$message_0301_0026_0001$$$::She was entrusted with it ten years ago, and she said that it's only recently that she actually became able to protect the land.::
36122::$$$message_0301_0027_0000$$$::For that reason, the Tohsaka family was unaware of Kiritsugu Emiya's existence, or his son for that matter.::
36123::$$$message_0301_0028_0000$$$::"...A spellcaster, huh? ...So you really are an amateur. You don't have any knowledge other than the magecraft that you can use, right?"::
36124::$$$message_0301_0029_0000$$$::"Yeah, that's right. I can only use Strengthening. The only things I know about are the names or a brief overview. I only used Strengthening on that desk to use it as a shield, and that was the best I've ever managed."::
36125::$$$message_0301_0030_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]A-are you serious!? Why are you telling me something like that!?"[lr]::
36126::$$$message_0301_0030_0001$$$::Then...[lr]::
36127::$$$message_0301_0030_0002$$$::She gets mad for an entirely different reason.::
36128::$$$message_0301_0031_0000$$$::"Is that something to get mad about?"[lr]::
36129::$$$message_0301_0031_0001$$$::"Well, I'm not mad, but... Look, Emiya.[lr]::
36130::$$$message_0301_0031_0002$$$::We are cooperating, but there's still things that we have to keep secret, right?[lr]::
36131::$$$message_0301_0031_0003$$$::We should be hiding the scope of our power, and most of all, a mage needs to keep their magecraft hidden at all costs."::
36132::$$$message_0301_0032_0000$$$::"Really? There's no use in hiding anything now, right? It's true that we can't be telling people, but you're a mage. There's no problem if I tell you. My old man said that magecraft is not something to hide desperately, no matter who the person is."::
36133::$$$message_0301_0033_0000$$$::"...What? Your father seriously said such a thing?"::
36134::$$$message_0301_0034_0000$$$::"Yeah. I guess he wanted to tell me not to be bound by the rules. He always told me that I don't need to learn magecraft and I can quit anytime I want to."::
36135::$$$message_0301_0035_0000$$$::"Ugh...!"[lr]::
36136::$$$message_0301_0035_0001$$$::Tohsaka grits her teeth.[lr]::
36137::$$$message_0301_0035_0002$$$::I don't know what she's so irritated about, but Tohsaka radiates hostility like never before.::
36138::$$$message_0301_0036_0000$$$::"...Don't be ridiculous.[lr]::
36139::$$$message_0301_0036_0001$$$::Your father is not a mage. If you were trained by someone like that, I won't approve of you as a mage either."::
36140::$$$message_0301_0037_0000$$$::"Tohsaka? Calm down. Why are you so mad? Well, I know I'm no mage compared to you, but my old man was a great mage."::
36141::$$$message_0301_0038_0000$$$::"...That's not it. That's not what I'm trying to say. What I can't stand is that..."[lr]::
36142::$$$message_0301_0038_0001$$$::That [font italic=true]what[font italic=false]?[lr]::
36143::$$$message_0301_0038_0002$$$::She got herself worked up, but having said that, her anger seems to dissipate.::
36144::$$$message_0301_0039_0000$$$::"...I'm sorry. I was wrong. Everyone is trained differently. I'm proud of myself, so I don't have the right to tell you what's right or not."::
36145::$$$message_0301_0040_0000$$$::"...I don't get it. Was there something that bothered you? Um, like my old man's way of teaching or is it my lack of experience?"::
36146::$$$message_0301_0041_0000$$$::"Yeah. I have complaints about your inexperience.[lr]::
36147::$$$message_0301_0041_0001$$$::How you've been training for years but only know Strengthening, or how you tell me your weaknesses."[lr]::
36148::$$$message_0301_0041_0002$$$::Tohsaka smiles suggestively.[lr]::
36149::$$$message_0301_0041_0003$$$::...I think I just felt a chill run down my spine.::
36150::$$$message_0301_0042_0000$$$::"Ugh, look, I get it. But there's nothing I can do about it. I'm only good at Strengthening, and my old man passed away. There was no way for me to learn anything else."::
36151::$$$message_0301_0043_0000$$$::"Yes, that's the limit of a lone mage. Mages don't know when they're going to die, so that's why they pass down their Magic Crest and join the Association, right?"::
36152::$$$message_0301_0044_0000$$$::"...What I got angry about was that your father didn't try to do any of that.[lr]::
36153::$$$message_0301_0044_0001$$$::A mage's craft isn't theirs alone.[lr]::
36154::$$$message_0301_0044_0002$$$::Magecraft is the sum total of each mage's life that is passed down from parent to child over many generations. So that responsibility is no longer one person's."::
36155::$$$message_0301_0045_0000$$$::"So the first condition to be taught magecraft is to pass it down to future generations. A child who is born into a mage's family instantly becomes a successor and an inheritor.[lr]::
36156::$$$message_0301_0045_0001$$$::We were born for that purpose and die for that purpose."::
36157::$$$message_0301_0046_0000$$$::"A mage's child isn't meant to be a human in any way.[lr]::
36158::$$$message_0301_0046_0001$$$::No, it is the duty of a mage with a lineage to change what is born as a human into something else through many years of hard training.[lr]::
36159::$$$message_0301_0046_0002$$$::...I'm trying to say your father isn't a mage. Your father prioritized being a parent over being a mage."::
36160::$$$message_0301_0047_0000$$$::She explains without making eye contact and looks away.[lr]::
36161::$$$message_0301_0047_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
36162::$$$message_0301_0047_0002$$$::To be honest, I don't know why Tohsaka is mad.[lr]::
36163::$$$message_0301_0047_0003$$$::How Tohsaka felt being raised in this house...[lr]::
36164::$$$message_0301_0047_0004$$$::What kind of training she went through as the daughter of a mage and how much she had to sacrifice...[lr]::
36165::$$$message_0301_0047_0005$$$::No matter how hard I try to imagine, I will never be able to be like her.::
36166::$$$message_0301_0048_0000$$$::"...Hey, Tohsaka. Is that why you saw me as an enemy? Since I don't have the mindset of a mage."::
36167::$$$message_0301_0049_0000$$$::"...That's right. It's not that I hate you, but I can't approve of how you carry yourself.[lr]::
36168::$$$message_0301_0049_0001$$$::...So that's why I had to teach you a lesson! Is that bad!?"::
36169::$$$message_0301_0050_0000$$$::"Well, it is bad... But I appreciate the warning.[lr]::
36170::$$$message_0301_0050_0001$$$::If it wasn't for that happening today, I wouldn't have noticed the Master at school, and I wouldn't have been able to cooperate with you."[lr]::
36171::$$$message_0301_0050_0002$$$::I stare at her in affirmation.::
36172::$$$message_0301_0051_0000$$$::Tohsaka groans uncomfortably.[lr]::
36173::$$$message_0301_0051_0001$$$::"Geez, why is a guy like this Saber's master!?"[lr]::
36174::$$$message_0301_0051_0002$$$::Her complaint really comes out of left field.::
36175::$$$message_0301_0052_0000$$$::We've been talking so long, it's already gotten dark.[lr]::
36176::$$$message_0301_0052_0001$$$::It's almost 7 PM... I need to get home soon or else Saber will get mad.::
36177::$$$message_0301_0053_0000$$$::"So Tohsaka, we're going to look for the Master at school, right?"[lr]::
36178::$$$message_0301_0053_0001$$$::"Right. Let's meet at the hallway after school tomorrow.[lr]::
36179::$$$message_0301_0053_0002$$$::Oh, also I'll have Archer take you home. I can't walk you home since I have something to do, but there's no problem with Archer, right?"::
36180::$$$message_0301_0054_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
36181::$$$message_0301_0054_0001$$$::I completely forgot until she mentioned him.[lr]::
36182::$$$message_0301_0054_0002$$$::This is Tohsaka's house, so of course Archer would be here.::
36183::$$$message_0301_0055_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36184::$$$message_0301_0055_0001$$$::The knight in red, Archer, takes form.[lr]::
36185::$$$message_0301_0055_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
36186::$$$message_0301_0055_0003$$$::Come to think of it, this is my first time actually facing him.::
36187::$$$message_0301_0056_0000$$$::The Servant that fought Saber and almost got his head cut off by her.[lr]::
36188::$$$message_0301_0056_0001$$$::The man who paid no heed to Saber, and even tried to bury her along with Berserker.::
36189::$$$message_0301_0057_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
36190::$$$message_0301_0057_0001$$$::...It might be because of those things.[lr]::
36191::$$$message_0301_0057_0002$$$::When I faced him and looked him in the eyes, I instinctively felt that...[lr]::
36192::$$$message_0301_0057_0003$$$::I hate him.[lr]::
36193::$$$message_0301_0057_0004$$$::It's probable that I'll never accept him.::
36194::$$$message_0301_0058_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36195::$$$message_0301_0058_0001$$$::Maybe it's the same for Archer, as he stares at me with enmity.[lr]::
36196::$$$message_0301_0058_0002$$$::...Hmph, that's just what I want.[lr]::
36197::$$$message_0301_0058_0003$$$::If he hates me, I can hate him back without any guilt.::
36198::$$$message_0301_0059_0000$$$::"Take care of him, Archer. We're in a truce now, so don't attack him."[lr]::
36199::$$$message_0301_0059_0001$$$::"...I know. I will obey my Master."::
36200::$$$message_0301_0060_0000$$$::Archer disappears.[lr]::
36201::$$$message_0301_0060_0001$$$::Since he can't go outside dressed like that, it must mean that he will escort me in spirit form.&®'Æ
