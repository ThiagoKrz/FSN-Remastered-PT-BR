65063::$$$message_0598_0000_0000$$$::...She hears a voice.[lr]::
65064::$$$message_0598_0000_0001$$$::Her body is in tatters and her mind is a haze, but she hears a voice that she didn't want to hear.::
65065::$$$message_0598_0001_0000$$$::"I don't know if it's mutual, but I've known about you for quite a while, Shirou."::
65066::$$$message_0598_0002_0000$$$::She doesn't consider why she can hear their conversation.[lr]::
65067::$$$message_0598_0002_0001$$$::She just wishes that she couldn't.[lr]::
65068::$$$message_0598_0002_0002$$$::If she could move her hands, she'd cover her ears. If she could move her legs, she would go to the living room and put a stop to this.::
65069::$$$message_0598_0003_0000$$$::"I was watching, right after I came out of the building. I saw some boy at the edge of campus trying over and over to jump a bar that was too high for him, like a moron."::
65070::$$$message_0598_0004_0000$$$::"...Ngh."[lr]::
65071::$$$message_0598_0004_0001$$$::The girl bites her lip.[lr]::
65072::$$$message_0598_0004_0002$$$::Her sluggish fingers clench the bedsheets hard enough to tear them.[lr]::
65073::$$$message_0598_0004_0003$$$::The old story her sister recounts in a disinterested tone[line2][lr]::
65074::$$$message_0598_0004_0004$$$::The sight on the school yard that evening, four years ago[line2][lr]::
65075::$$$message_0598_0004_0005$$$::Rin is talking about the memory like it only belongs to her.[lr]::
65076::$$$message_0598_0004_0006$$$::Like it's something that only she knew about.[lr]::
65077::$$$message_0598_0004_0007$$$::She's lost in a beautiful memory, even though she/I didn't even know I/she was there.::
65078::$$$message_0598_0005_0000$$$::"Stop. Please, stop. I'm begging you, don't..."[lr]::
65079::$$$message_0598_0005_0001$$$::Don't take this memory from me, the girl begs.[lr]::
65080::$$$message_0598_0005_0002$$$::With an inaudible voice, she squeezes out a plea that no one can hear.::
65081::$$$message_0598_0006_0000$$$::Her sister continues telling the tale.[lr]::
65082::$$$message_0598_0006_0001$$$::The girl is getting left behind, just as she feared.[lr]::
65083::$$$message_0598_0006_0002$$$::It was the only thing.[lr]::
65084::$$$message_0598_0006_0003$$$::That memory was the one and only precious thing she had over her big sister, who was now treating it like any other memory.::
65085::$$$message_0598_0007_0000$$$::"No... No, no, no...!"[lr]::
65086::$$$message_0598_0007_0001$$$::She reinforces her frayed nerves with her power[line2]her mind, and covers both ears with her hands.[lr]::
65087::$$$message_0598_0007_0002$$$::She doesn't want to hear it.[lr]::
65088::$$$message_0598_0007_0003$$$::This is torture.[lr]::
65089::$$$message_0598_0007_0004$$$::Why, why, why does she know what's happening in the living room?[lr]::
65090::$$$message_0598_0007_0005$$$::Does her shadow stretch that far?[lr]::
65091::$$$message_0598_0007_0006$$$::No, never mind that, she doesn't want to hear anything.[lr]::
65092::$$$message_0598_0007_0007$$$::No more.[lr]::
65093::$$$message_0598_0007_0008$$$::If she hears any more, she has a feeling she'll go insane.::
65094::$$$message_0598_0008_0000$$$::Still, she can't block out the conversation, even as she covers her ears.[lr]::
65095::$$$message_0598_0008_0001$$$::Her sister's words echo straight into her brain.[lr]::
65096::$$$message_0598_0008_0002$$$::She can cover her ears and gouge out her eyes, but she can't escape that sight.[lr]::
65097::$$$message_0598_0008_0003$$$::And then...::
65098::$$$message_0598_0009_0000$$$::"Shirou. When it comes down to it, I'm going to kill her. It's the best way for both of us.[lr]::
65099::$$$message_0598_0009_0001$$$::You need to think about that, too."::
65100::$$$message_0598_0010_0000$$$::Her sister coldly thrust those[lr]::
65101::$$$message_0598_0010_0001$$$::words she least wanted to hear[lr]::
65102::$$$message_0598_0010_0002$$$::at the last person she wanted to hear them.::
65103::$$$message_0598_0011_0000$$$::And then she couldn't hear their voices anymore.[lr]::
65104::$$$message_0598_0011_0001$$$::She can't tell what's happening in the living room.[lr]::
65105::$$$message_0598_0011_0002$$$::...Of course not.[lr]::
65106::$$$message_0598_0011_0003$$$::Her world consists only of this dark room.[lr]::
65107::$$$message_0598_0011_0004$$$::She can't step into that distant, bright world.::
65108::$$$message_0598_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65109::$$$message_0598_0012_0001$$$::...Her eyelids feel warm.[lr]::
65110::$$$message_0598_0012_0002$$$::She realizes she's been crying on her own.[lr]::
65111::$$$message_0598_0012_0003$$$::She's sad and frustrated.::
65112::$$$message_0598_0013_0000$$$::Her sister is a coward.[lr]::
65113::$$$message_0598_0013_0001$$$::Why, why is she forcing the obvious conclusion on Senpai?[lr]::
65114::$$$message_0598_0013_0002$$$::Because it's her duty as the Tohsaka mage? Then she can fulfill it on her own. Why pull Senpai into it?[lr]::
65115::$$$message_0598_0013_0003$$$::My sister is trying to make my Senpai, my one and only ally in the whole world, stand with her.::
65116::$$$message_0598_0014_0000$$$::"Nee...san."[lr]::
65117::$$$message_0598_0014_0001$$$::...Hate.[lr]::
65118::$$$message_0598_0014_0002$$$::She knows how self-centered it sounds, but she hates her.[lr]::
65119::$$$message_0598_0014_0003$$$::She's going to make Senpai abandon Sakura Matou.[lr]::
65120::$$$message_0598_0014_0004$$$::Rin Tohsaka is truly cruel for doing that.::
65121::$$$message_0598_0015_0000$$$::"...Nee-san."[lr]::
65122::$$$message_0598_0015_0001$$$::...But, it's strange.[lr]::
65123::$$$message_0598_0015_0002$$$::Why do I hate her so much, when it's what I want?[lr]::
65124::$$$message_0598_0015_0003$$$::Nee-san said I should just disappear.[lr]::
65125::$$$message_0598_0015_0004$$$::I know that, and I agree.[lr]::
65126::$$$message_0598_0015_0005$$$::...I can't remember the details anymore, but I do know that Shirou Emiya would be saved if I was gone.::
65127::$$$message_0598_0016_0000$$$::"...No. I don't want to."[lr]::
65128::$$$message_0598_0016_0001$$$::I can't.[lr]::
65129::$$$message_0598_0016_0002$$$::I don't want to lose anything else.[lr]::
65130::$$$message_0598_0016_0003$$$::I don't want to be alone anymore.[lr]::
65131::$$$message_0598_0016_0004$$$::I know warmth now, so I'm afraid of the cold.[lr]::
65132::$$$message_0598_0016_0005$$$::I know warmth now, so I hate everyone who's been warm this whole time.[lr]::
65133::$$$message_0598_0016_0006$$$::...I won't disappear for them.[lr]::
65134::$$$message_0598_0016_0007$$$::...I won't let them kill me.[lr]::
65135::$$$message_0598_0016_0008$$$::Because, because...::
65136::$$$message_0598_0017_0000$$$::                                    "Because... I didn't do anything wrong."::
65137::$$$message_0598_0018_0000$$$::Everyone else is wrong.[lr]::
65138::$$$message_0598_0018_0001$$$::I never wanted this outcome.[lr]::
65139::$$$message_0598_0018_0002$$$::It only happened because nobody helped me.[lr]::
65140::$$$message_0598_0018_0003$$$::So...if nobody did anything to help me, that means they wanted it to happen.[lr]::
65141::$$$message_0598_0018_0004$$$::They weren't against "me." That's the same as agreeing with me.[lr]::
65142::$$$message_0598_0018_0005$$$::In that case...[lr]::
65143::$$$message_0598_0018_0006$$$::Nobody will punish me. They couldn't if they tried.::
65144::$$$message_0598_0019_0000$$$::"...I won't die. Not the way she wants."[lr]::
65145::$$$message_0598_0019_0001$$$::...No.[lr]::
65146::$$$message_0598_0019_0002$$$::The actual problem is that I can't die.[lr]::
65147::$$$message_0598_0019_0003$$$::Nobody can kill me.[lr]::
65148::$$$message_0598_0019_0004$$$::If they're going to, I'm okay with that.[lr]::
65149::$$$message_0598_0019_0005$$$::If I'm going to be killed[line4]I'll[line4]instead.::
65150::$$$message_0598_0020_0000$$$::Not just my sister.[lr]::
65151::$$$message_0598_0020_0001$$$::Even Senpai. If they try to erase me, I won't put up with it anymore.[lr]::
65152::$$$message_0598_0020_0002$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
65153::$$$message_0598_0020_0003$$$::If they're going to hate me and go far away, then I'd rather...[lr]::
65154::$$$message_0598_0020_0004$$$::[line4]Senpai with my own hands before he ends up with someone else, just like in my nightmares[line2]::
65155::$$$message_0598_0021_0000$$$::"Ah... Haah, ugh!"[lr]::
65156::$$$message_0598_0021_0001$$$::She coughs.[lr]::
65157::$$$message_0598_0021_0002$$$::Painfully, she turns her delusions into blood, expelling it from her mouth.::
65158::$$$message_0598_0022_0000$$$::"...Oh, no. I think I'm no good anymore, Senpai."[lr]::
65159::$$$message_0598_0022_0001$$$::Nothing connects.[lr]::
65160::$$$message_0598_0022_0002$$$::She doesn't know what's good or bad.[lr]::
65161::$$$message_0598_0022_0003$$$::She doesn't know if she's right or wrong.[lr]::
65162::$$$message_0598_0022_0004$$$::Who am I? How much sanity do I have left? Everything's getting so foggy, I feel like I'm going mad.::
65163::$$$message_0598_0023_0000$$$::"Hi. Are you still there, Sakura?"[lr]::
65164::$$$message_0598_0023_0001$$$::   And then...[lr]::
65165::$$$message_0598_0023_0002$$$::She realizes there's a silver-haired girl standing there.[lr]::
65166::$$$message_0598_0023_0003$$$::She's just like her.[lr]::
65167::$$$message_0598_0023_0004$$$::A pale girl who was never treated as human, meant to become a vessel.::
65168::$$$message_0598_0024_0000$$$::"Saber, Lancer, Caster, Berserker.[lr]::
65169::$$$message_0598_0024_0001$$$::Those four alone would have been plenty. Where did you find a soul like that? I'm surprised that you're already full when Assassin and Rider are still out there."[lr]::
65170::$$$message_0598_0024_0002$$$::...She doesn't know.[lr]::
65171::$$$message_0598_0024_0003$$$::She's heard from her grandfather that, just like the girl, she's a container to store the souls of defeated Servants.[lr]::
65172::$$$message_0598_0024_0004$$$::But... the implication that Servants other than the ones she was given were defeated is...::
65173::$$$message_0598_0025_0000$$$::"That's good. Now I don't have to worry about Archer getting taken, so I won't press you on it.[lr]::
65174::$$$message_0598_0025_0001$$$::Do you know what's going to happen to you now, Sakura?"[lr]::
65175::$$$message_0598_0025_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65176::$$$message_0598_0025_0003$$$::...She feels something go cold, deep inside her head.[lr]::
65177::$$$message_0598_0025_0004$$$::The question pulls Sakura Matou out of her fevered haze.::
65178::$$$message_0598_0026_0000$$$::"I don't know. What's going to happen to me?"[lr]::
65179::$$$message_0598_0026_0001$$$::The pale girl pauses.[lr]::
65180::$$$message_0598_0026_0002$$$::The Einzbern Master, created solely to be a vessel,[lr]::
65181::$$$message_0598_0026_0003$$$::looks down at the imitation before her.::
65182::$$$message_0598_0026_0004$$$::"You'll die. There's absolutely no saving you."[lr]::
65183::$$$message_0598_0026_0005$$$::She tells the broken girl of their shared fate.:ݲ5
