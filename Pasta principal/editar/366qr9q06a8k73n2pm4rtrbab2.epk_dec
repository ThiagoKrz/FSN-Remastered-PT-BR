21386::$$$message_0194_0000_0000$$$::The elation I'd felt vanishes and my mind goes blank.[lr]::
21387::$$$message_0194_0000_0001$$$::Goosebumps cover my body, and I realize I've forgotten how to breathe.::
21388::$$$message_0194_0001_0000$$$::"Sh...rou..."[lr]::
21389::$$$message_0194_0001_0001$$$::Saber, standing behind me, probably feels the same.[lr]::
21390::$$$message_0194_0001_0002$$$::She grips my hand tightly in her own.[lr]::
21391::$$$message_0194_0001_0003$$$::The same way I feel a sense of impending death...[lr]::
21392::$$$message_0194_0001_0004$$$::Saber feels the inevitable despair.::
21393::$$$message_0194_0002_0000$$$::"Your wait is over, Saber.[lr]::
21394::$$$message_0194_0002_0001$$$::As promised, I've come to claim you."::
21395::$$$message_0194_0004_0000$$$::"Ar...cher..."[lr]::
21396::$$$message_0194_0004_0001$$$::The man in gold.[lr]::
21397::$$$message_0194_0004_0002$$$::The unidentified Heroic Spirit who annihilated Caster's bone soldiers, and even took out Caster with barely any effort.::
21398::$$$message_0194_0005_0000$$$::Now that monster stands in front of us.[lr]::
21399::$$$message_0194_0005_0001$$$::He's so close.[lr]::
21400::$$$message_0194_0005_0002$$$::We're at exactly the right distance to begin slashing at each other at any moment. Death looms right in front of us, even more than when we faced Berserker.::
21401::$$$message_0194_0006_0000$$$::"What's wrong, Saber? I've come all this way to get you.[lr]::
21402::$$$message_0194_0006_0001$$$::You know it is improper to simply remain quiet.[lr]::
21403::$$$message_0194_0006_0002$$$::Or do you intend to play a bit before you admit you are mine, my King of Knights?"::
21404::$$$message_0194_0007_0000$$$::Archer stifles a laugh.[lr]::
21405::$$$message_0194_0007_0001$$$::He's not even looking at me.[lr]::
21406::$$$message_0194_0007_0002$$$::Saber is his only focus.[lr]::
21407::$$$message_0194_0007_0003$$$::He admires her like she is a piece of art.::
21408::$$$message_0194_0008_0000$$$::Saber's demeanor changes.[lr]::
21409::$$$message_0194_0008_0001$$$::She must have made up her mind.[lr]::
21410::$$$message_0194_0008_0002$$$::She's already determined the man in front of us is an enemy, while I've hardly moved a muscle.::
21411::$$$message_0194_0009_0000$$$::"Shirou. I will do everything I can to block his first attack. Please take that opportunity to retreat.[lr]::
21412::$$$message_0194_0009_0001$$$::I know it will be difficult, but I can only do so much against a Servant like him."::
21413::$$$message_0194_0010_0000$$$::I can hear the apology in her voice for not being able to do more.[lr]::
21414::$$$message_0194_0010_0001$$$::Even someone as powerful as Saber can only block his first attack.[lr]::
21415::$$$message_0194_0010_0002$$$::My chances of getting away from this guy are slim at best.::
21416::$$$message_0194_0011_0000$$$::Saber is asking me to forgive her for what is about to happen.[lr]::
21417::$$$message_0194_0011_0001$$$::She...[lr]::
21418::$$$message_0194_0011_0002$$$::She probably knows there's no way for her to defeat the man in gold.::
21419::$$$message_0194_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21420::$$$message_0194_0012_0001$$$::I can't let her do that.[lr]::
21421::$$$message_0194_0012_0002$$$::This is different than when we fought Berserker.[lr]::
21422::$$$message_0194_0012_0003$$$::I know, though I don't have proof, that making Saber fight this Servant can only end badly.::
21423::$$$message_0194_0013_0000$$$::...Actually, I do have proof.[lr]::
21424::$$$message_0194_0013_0001$$$::I know from seeing his Noble Phantasm last night.[lr]::
21425::$$$message_0194_0013_0002$$$::Saber can't beat him right now.[lr]::
21426::$$$message_0194_0013_0003$$$::This is not a matter of her skills as a knight.[lr]::
21427::$$$message_0194_0013_0004$$$::That's not even the right way to look at this.[lr]::
21428::$$$message_0194_0013_0005$$$::No Heroic Spirit, so long as they remain a Heroic Spirit, can beat the man in gold.::
21429::$$$message_0194_0014_0000$$$::"No. You're the one who's going to run, Saber."[lr]::
21430::$$$message_0194_0014_0001$$$::"What? Shirou...!?"[lr]::
21431::$$$message_0194_0014_0002$$$::I cover Saber and face Archer.[lr]::
21432::$$$message_0194_0014_0003$$$::"Oh? I see. You have a Master. His shabby appearance led me to think he was no more than a lowly dog."[lr]::
21433::$$$message_0194_0014_0004$$$::He smiles cheerfully.[lr]::
21434::$$$message_0194_0014_0005$$$::He raises an arm and lazily snaps his fingers.::
21435::$$$message_0194_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21436::$$$message_0194_0015_0001$$$::   I feel sick.[lr]::
21437::$$$message_0194_0015_0002$$$::I need to leave right now, or I'm dead.[lr]::
21438::$$$message_0194_0015_0003$$$::There's no rhyme or reason.[lr]::
21439::$$$message_0194_0015_0004$$$::I just know, instinctively, that this guy will kill me for standing in front of him like this.::
21440::$$$message_0194_0016_0000$$$::"Go, Saber![lr]::
21441::$$$message_0194_0016_0001$$$::We're near the church. The priest there should be able to shelter you, even from him!"::
21442::$$$message_0194_0017_0000$$$::I push Saber away and start running, trying to escape the death I can only hope isn't inevitable.[lr]::
21443::$$$message_0194_0017_0001$$$::There's no plan here.[lr]::
21444::$$$message_0194_0017_0002$$$::I'm just going to risk it all and run straight at this guy, then I'm going to project Saber's sword again, just like when we fought Berserker.::
21445::$$$message_0194_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21446::$$$message_0194_0018_0001$$$::I'm blown back.[lr]::
21447::$$$message_0194_0018_0002$$$::   What just happened?[lr]::
21448::$$$message_0194_0018_0003$$$::The moment he snapped his fingers, something appeared right beside me.::
21449::$$$message_0194_0019_0000$$$::"O...w..."[lr]::
21450::$$$message_0194_0019_0001$$$::It's...a giant hammer. It knocks me aside like a piece of trash and I slam hard into the ground.::
21451::$$$message_0194_0020_0000$$$::"Ha...ah..."[lr]::
21452::$$$message_0194_0020_0001$$$::I can't move.[lr]::
21453::$$$message_0194_0020_0002$$$::My body is completely useless, like all my bones have turned to jelly.[lr]::
21454::$$$message_0194_0020_0003$$$::I've lost all sensation in my limbs. The pain is so dull, I can't even tell if I'm still alive.::
21455::$$$message_0194_0021_0000$$$::"I will not kill you. If I destroy you now, Saber will disappear. As much as I hate to, I will keep you alive until the Holy Grail is summoned."[lr]::
21456::$$$message_0194_0021_0001$$$::The man laughs.::
21457::$$$message_0194_0022_0000$$$::"Ah...kuh..."[lr]::
21458::$$$message_0194_0022_0001$$$::I try to push myself up, but my body won't listen.::
21459::$$$message_0194_0023_0000$$$::"Do not let it go to your head, mongrel. There are ways to allow a Servant to remain in this world without you. This is just the path of least resistance. If you make so much as another peep though, I will kill you."::
21460::$$$message_0194_0024_0000$$$::"Ah...g..."[lr]::
21461::$$$message_0194_0024_0001$$$::And then my mind goes blank.[lr]::
21462::$$$message_0194_0024_0002$$$::He [font italic=true]will[font italic=false] kill me.[lr]::
21463::$$$message_0194_0024_0003$$$::If I make even a single move, he will do just what he said he would.::
21464::$$$message_0194_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21465::$$$message_0194_0025_0001$$$::I can't possibly move after that kind of warning.::
21466::$$$message_0194_0026_0000$$$::"Shirou!"[lr]::
21467::$$$message_0194_0026_0001$$$::Saber tries to run toward me.::
21468::$$$message_0194_0027_0000$$$::"Where do you think you're going? There are no more obstacles between us. It is not this piece of trash you should be running to."[lr]::
21469::$$$message_0194_0027_0001$$$::The man in gold won't allow it.[lr]::
21470::$$$message_0194_0027_0002$$$::He stands in front of me and waits for Saber to reach me.::
21471::$$$message_0194_0028_0000$$$::"Hngh..."[lr]::
21472::$$$message_0194_0028_0001$$$::Saber stops and glares at him.[lr]::
21473::$$$message_0194_0028_0002$$$::The two stand about ten meters apart.[lr]::
21474::$$$message_0194_0028_0003$$$::I don't know about Archer, but Saber can close that distant in a heartbeat.::
21475::$$$message_0194_0029_0000$$$::"Hmph. Seems you're not willing to come to me yet. I can't fathom why. So great a Heroic Spirit as you should realize what a singular honor it is to be chosen by [font italic=true]me[font italic=false]."[lr]::
21476::$$$message_0194_0029_0001$$$::"What drivel. Even if I become a Heroic Spirit, I am still king. I will never submit to you."::
21477::$$$message_0194_0030_0000$$$::"Oh? A king you may be, but you are still a woman.[lr]::
21478::$$$message_0194_0030_0001$$$::A woman's greatest happiness is to bow before her lord...to serve and devote herself to him. Why, then, would you ever refuse to do so? Surely you are not so na칦ve a maiden that you are afraid to be my woman, are you?"::
21479::$$$message_0194_0031_0000$$$::"Why, you...!"[lr]::
21480::$$$message_0194_0031_0001$$$::"Don't be so angry. I do not only [font italic=true]take[font italic=false]. I will return to you equal joy. When you are mine, I will give you [font italic=true]everything in the world.[font italic=false][lr]::
21481::$$$message_0194_0031_0002$$$::You should be honored, for I have deemed you worthy.::
21482::$$$message_0194_0032_0000$$$::The man moves.[lr]::
21483::$$$message_0194_0032_0001$$$::He extends both arms and approaches Saber, as if in a welcoming embrace.::
21484::$$$message_0194_0033_0000$$$::"Yes... You need never become a Guardian, nor return to your fated death.[lr]::
21485::$$$message_0194_0033_0001$$$::I will say this only once more: Saber, accept that you are [font italic=true]mine[font italic=false].[lr]::
21486::$$$message_0194_0033_0002$$$::Let us enjoy our second lives, here, together."::
21487::$$$message_0194_0034_0000$$$::"I refuse.[lr]::
21488::$$$message_0194_0034_0001$$$::I have no interest in such things. More importantly, I could never, ever live alongside you, no matter what may happen."[lr]::
21489::$$$message_0194_0034_0002$$$::Saber looks straight at Archer as she speaks.[lr]::
21490::$$$message_0194_0034_0003$$$::She stands firm, not taking so much as a step back.::
21491::$$$message_0194_0035_0000$$$::"Ku...fu...hahaha, hahahahahahaha!"[lr]::
21492::$$$message_0194_0035_0001$$$::His laughter suddenly stops.[lr]::
21493::$$$message_0194_0035_0002$$$::I'm not sure what he found so funny in the first place.::
21494::$$$message_0194_0036_0000$$$::"Good, good. That's the spunk I expect from a woman I choose![lr]::
21495::$$$message_0194_0036_0001$$$::Ah yes, it might be amusing to have at least one who isn't so obedient."::
21496::$$$message_0194_0037_0000$$$::"All right. By force, then. Once I've obtained the grail, I'll pour its contents all over you."::
21497::$$$message_0194_0038_0000$$$::"Rejoice, Saber. Once I've done that, you won't need a Master.[lr]::
21498::$$$message_0194_0038_0001$$$::You will be taking in all the power of the omnipotent vessel, the Holy Grail. You will no longer have to live as a Servant, serving humans as their familiar."::
21499::$$$message_0194_0039_0000$$$::He's so damn smug.[lr]::
21500::$$$message_0194_0039_0001$$$::To that...::
21501::$$$message_0194_0040_0000$$$::"Archer. What are your intentions?"[lr]::
21502::$$$message_0194_0040_0001$$$::She must have realized that the only option is to fight him.[lr]::
21503::$$$message_0194_0040_0002$$$::And before she engages with the enemy, she wants to know why he does what he does.::
21504::$$$message_0194_0041_0000$$$::"My intentions? I've forgotten. Unfortunately for me, I already possess all the world's riches. There is nothing left for me to wish for."[lr]::
21505::$$$message_0194_0041_0001$$$::"What!? You do not seek the Holy Grail?"::
21506::$$$message_0194_0042_0000$$$::"The Holy Grail? Oh you mean immortality? Hmph. I gave that to a snake."[lr]::
21507::$$$message_0194_0042_0001$$$::"You gave immortality to a...snake?"[lr]::
21508::$$$message_0194_0042_0002$$$::Saber freezes.[lr]::
21509::$$$message_0194_0042_0003$$$::[font italic=true]What just happened?[font italic=false][lr]::
21510::$$$message_0194_0042_0004$$$::Saber subtly shakes her head to refute those words.::
21511::$$$message_0194_0043_0000$$$::"But this world is certainly amusing.[lr]::
21512::$$$message_0194_0043_0001$$$::The basic principles remain the same. The adornments are so elaborate now, though. Maybe ruling the world once again wouldn't be so bad...[lr]::
21513::$$$message_0194_0043_0002$$$::Yes. I suppose you could say that is my intent. And, if it allows me to accomplish that faster, the Holy Grail's power may not be so useless."::
21514::$$$message_0194_0044_0000$$$::"The desire to dominate, then... You have fallen from grace, Archer. I did not think that is what would drive you to seek the Holy Grail."::
21515::$$$message_0194_0045_0000$$$::"It's not a matter of my desiring it. All the world's riches belong to me. I can't abide others making use of what is mine.[lr]::
21516::$$$message_0194_0045_0001$$$::You would hate for another to use your sacred sword, wouldn't you, King of Knights?"[lr]::
21517::$$$message_0194_0045_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
21518::$$$message_0194_0046_0000$$$::Pale mist shrouds Saber.[lr]::
21519::$$$message_0194_0046_0001$$$::Then, in a flash, she is wearing her brilliant silver armor.[lr]::
21520::$$$message_0194_0046_0002$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
21521::$$$message_0194_0046_0003$$$::He doesn't move a muscle.[lr]::
21522::$$$message_0194_0046_0004$$$::In the next instant, Saber dashes forward.[lr]::
21523::$$$message_0194_0046_0005$$$::In the space of a single breath, she rushes straight at the man and swings her invisible sword at him with deadly speed!::
21524::$$$message_0194_0047_0000$$$::"Ngh...!"[lr]::
21525::$$$message_0194_0047_0001$$$::Saber goes flying backwards.[lr]::
21526::$$$message_0194_0047_0002$$$::If Saber's armor materialized by magical energy, Archer's must be the same.[lr]::
21527::$$$message_0194_0047_0003$$$::In the brief space of their rapid exchange, the man in gold arms himself.[lr]::
21528::$$$message_0194_0047_0004$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21529::$$$message_0194_0047_0005$$$::Saber looks calmly at Archer as she readies her sword.[lr]::
21530::$$$message_0194_0047_0006$$$::Even as his eyes meet hers, his sneer remains.[lr]::
21531::$$$message_0194_0047_0007$$$::"Very well. I will allow you to oppose me, Saber."[lr]::
21532::$$$message_0194_0047_0008$$$::The enemy happily announces the beginning of battle.::
21533::$$$message_0194_0048_0000$$$::A white light bursts in the air between them.[lr]::
21534::$$$message_0194_0048_0001$$$::Saber's sword, shrouded in a bolt of lightning, cleaves directly toward the golden knight.::
21535::$$$message_0194_0049_0000$$$::One...two...three...four strikes![lr]::
21536::$$$message_0194_0049_0001$$$::Each time Saber's sword strikes, blinding light flashes from the contact.[lr]::
21537::$$$message_0194_0049_0002$$$::Watching her repeated attacks is like staring at a strobe light.[lr]::
21538::$$$message_0194_0049_0003$$$::It's just like when I first saw Saber, that night when she fought Lancer.[lr]::
21539::$$$message_0194_0049_0004$$$::Saber channels her excess magical energy into her sword and strikes with such speed and precision that she all but becomes a lightning bolt.::
21540::$$$message_0194_0050_0000$$$::The clang of sword against armor echoes through the air.[lr]::
21541::$$$message_0194_0050_0001$$$::Archer hasn't even drawn his weapon yet. As Saber's sword strikes at him, he barely manages to defend his head with both hands.[lr]::
21542::$$$message_0194_0050_0002$$$::He simply doesn't have the skill to block Saber's attacks.[lr]::
21543::$$$message_0194_0050_0003$$$::Saber's skill with a sword is vastly superior to his.::
21544::$$$message_0194_0051_0000$$$::On top of that, her sword is invisible.[lr]::
21545::$$$message_0194_0051_0001$$$::Even if Archer draws his weapon, he won't be able to defend against that invisible blade.::
21546::$$$message_0194_0052_0000$$$::It strikes his armor relentlessly.[lr]::
21547::$$$message_0194_0052_0001$$$::The sword hits the armor, chipping away at it and sending sparks showering in all directions.[lr]::
21548::$$$message_0194_0052_0002$$$::The only thing the man can do is ward Saber's blows from his face with his hands.[lr]::
21549::$$$message_0194_0052_0003$$$::This isn't a fight.[lr]::
21550::$$$message_0194_0052_0004$$$::It's a massacre.::
21551::$$$message_0194_0053_0000$$$::   But...[lr]::
21552::$$$message_0194_0053_0001$$$::In spite of the fury of Saber's attacks, Archer's armor remains intact.[lr]::
21553::$$$message_0194_0053_0002$$$::If he's still unscathed even after such a savage assault...[lr]::
21554::$$$message_0194_0053_0003$$$::...that golden armor must be his Noble Phantasm.::
21555::$$$message_0194_0054_0000$$$::"Hm. I suppose I can't allow this to continue. You certainly do have a limitless supply of magical energy. It's not often an attack can make my armor begin to creak."[lr]::
21556::$$$message_0194_0054_0001$$$::Archer raises his arm.[lr]::
21557::$$$message_0194_0054_0002$$$::...But not toward Saber.[lr]::
21558::$$$message_0194_0054_0003$$$::I have no idea what he's trying to do, but Archer just stretches his arm up into the empty night sky.::
21559::$$$message_0194_0055_0000$$$::"Enough playing around. Offer your body to me...right now."[lr]::
21560::$$$message_0194_0055_0001$$$::   Am I hallucinating? Is this an illusion?[lr]::
21561::$$$message_0194_0055_0002$$$::He has something in his hand.[lr]::
21562::$$$message_0194_0055_0003$$$::It's...a short sword, shaped like a key.::
21563::$$$message_0194_0056_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
21564::$$$message_0194_0056_0001$$$::Saber plants both feet, unleashing a much more powerful attack against Archer.[lr]::
21565::$$$message_0194_0056_0002$$$::But...[lr]::
21566::$$$message_0194_0056_0003$$$::Archer bats it aside with his dark red sword.::
21567::$$$message_0194_0057_0000$$$::"Is that a Noble Phantasm imbued with a curse of vengeance!?"[lr]::
21568::$$$message_0194_0057_0001$$$::Saber puts some distance between herself and Archer, glaring at his sword.[lr]::
21569::$$$message_0194_0057_0002$$$::The enemy wielding such a weapon is a threat, no question.[lr]::
21570::$$$message_0194_0057_0003$$$::But it also means he's showing his hand.[lr]::
21571::$$$message_0194_0057_0004$$$::Whether his Noble Phantasm is armor or a sword, we'll be able to figure out how to deal with it as long as we can see it.::
21572::$$$message_0194_0058_0000$$$::Saber readjusts her stance.[lr]::
21573::$$$message_0194_0058_0001$$$::Archer's already said his armor is at its limit.[lr]::
21574::$$$message_0194_0058_0002$$$::If Saber can go back on the offensive with the same fury as before, she should be able to cut through his armor.[lr]::
21575::$$$message_0194_0058_0003$$$::Even if he pulls out his Noble Phantasm now, the next blow will decide the match.::
21576::$$$message_0194_0059_0000$$$::"This is the end. Let us conclude our match that was interrupted all that time ago, Archer."[lr]::
21577::$$$message_0194_0059_0001$$$::The sword in her hand is still invisible.[lr]::
21578::$$$message_0194_0059_0002$$$::She readies her sacred sword, still bound up in swirling wind, and faces her enemy.[lr]::
21579::$$$message_0194_0059_0003$$$::Saber seems to know what that Noble Phantasm is.::
21580::$$$message_0194_0060_0000$$$::She put that distance between them because she knows how to deal with it; she's readying herself to face Archer directly.[lr]::
21581::$$$message_0194_0060_0001$$$::Each of them wields a sword, and if their powers are equal, then it is a matter of the wielder's skill.[lr]::
21582::$$$message_0194_0060_0002$$$::And that should mean Saber will win.::
21583::$$$message_0194_0061_0000$$$::"Very well. Come at me, Saber.[lr]::
21584::$$$message_0194_0061_0001$$$::In recognition of that sword of yours, I shall show you everything I have."[lr]::
21585::$$$message_0194_0061_0002$$$::The man laughs.[lr]::
21586::$$$message_0194_0061_0003$$$::"Fine!"[lr]::
21587::$$$message_0194_0061_0004$$$::Saber charges without hesitation.::
21588::$$$message_0194_0062_0000$$$::Her sword [font italic=true]will[font italic=false] cleave through his armor.[lr]::
21589::$$$message_0194_0062_0001$$$::The very instant I think that.::
21590::$$$message_0194_0063_0000$$$::                                               "Gate of Babylon."::
21591::$$$message_0194_0064_0000$$$::An invisible door opens behind the man.::
21592::$$$message_0194_0065_0000$$$::"Wha...t!?"[lr]::
21593::$$$message_0194_0065_0001$$$::Saber jerks to one side.[lr]::
21594::$$$message_0194_0065_0002$$$::Archer holds something else in his hand now, not the black and red sword.[lr]::
21595::$$$message_0194_0065_0003$$$::It's an invisible sword, like Saber's.[lr]::
21596::$$$message_0194_0065_0004$$$::By the time Saber deflects it, Archer already has a different sword.::
21597::$$$message_0194_0066_0000$$$::His swords strike at her in a merciless rain of ice shards.[lr]::
21598::$$$message_0194_0066_0001$$$::Saber twists away to dodge, but the air around her becomes almost solid with flying blades.[lr]::
21599::$$$message_0194_0066_0002$$$::She's driven back as the blades close in on her from all sides.[lr]::
21600::$$$message_0194_0066_0003$$$::As the shards clinging to Saber vanish, her enemy holds a deadly-looking weapon that resembles the grim reaper's scythe.::
21601::$$$message_0194_0067_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
21602::$$$message_0194_0067_0001$$$::Saber blocks the weapon arcing for her neck with a gauntlet.[lr]::
21603::$$$message_0194_0067_0002$$$::But it's useless.[lr]::
21604::$$$message_0194_0067_0003$$$::The scythe shears through her gauntlet like it's made of tissue paper and begins to drain her magical energy.[lr]::
21605::$$$message_0194_0067_0004$$$::It's as if it's trying to pull out her bones, rather than her blood or flesh.::
21606::$$$message_0194_0068_0000$$$::"Ah...kngh...!"[lr]::
21607::$$$message_0194_0068_0001$$$::Saber stumbles, but she manages to keep it together.[lr]::
21608::$$$message_0194_0068_0002$$$::But her retreat takes on a different note.[lr]::
21609::$$$message_0194_0068_0003$$$::She's not distancing herself to prepare for her next attack.[lr]::
21610::$$$message_0194_0068_0004$$$::She's desperately fleeing the enemy.::
21611::$$$message_0194_0069_0000$$$::"That...can't be..."[lr]::
21612::$$$message_0194_0069_0001$$$::Saber glares at Archer as she passes magical energy through her numbed arm.[lr]::
21613::$$$message_0194_0069_0002$$$::A halo of hilts floats around Archer.[lr]::
21614::$$$message_0194_0069_0003$$$::Those are the swords that slaughtered Caster...[lr]::
21615::$$$message_0194_0069_0004$$$::His Noble Phantasm... Now it's backing Saber into a corner.::
21616::$$$message_0194_0070_0000$$$::Even I, looking on from a distance, can't believe what I'm seeing.::
21617::$$$message_0194_0071_0000$$$::All those hilts floating behind him are definitely his Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
21618::$$$message_0194_0071_0001$$$::Not ten, not twenty...[lr]::
21619::$$$message_0194_0071_0002$$$::I can't see them all, but I can tell there's no end to them.[lr]::
21620::$$$message_0194_0071_0003$$$::They're all from different times and places.[lr]::
21621::$$$message_0194_0071_0004$$$::That Servant has all the divine mysteries that have ever been mentioned in various legends and lore...::
21622::$$$message_0194_0072_0000$$$::"Archer...who [font italic=true]are[font italic=false] you?"[lr]::
21623::$$$message_0194_0072_0001$$$::Saber's voice trembles.[lr]::
21624::$$$message_0194_0072_0002$$$::No Servant would ever reveal their True Name just because someone asks.[lr]::
21625::$$$message_0194_0072_0003$$$::But Archer's Noble Phantasm is so bizarre, Saber couldn't help but ask.::
21626::$$$message_0194_0073_0000$$$::"Answer me, Archer! A Heroic Spirit should only have one Noble Phantasm. Some may have multiple Noble Phantasms, but two is usually the limit.[lr]::
21627::$$$message_0194_0073_0001$$$::A Heroic Spirit with an endless supply of Noble Phantasms like you should not exist!"::
21628::$$$message_0194_0074_0000$$$::"Should not exist? Now, Saber, do not rush to judgment.[lr]::
21629::$$$message_0194_0074_0001$$$::Heroic Spirits make the weapons they used during their life into Noble Phantasms. So it's quite simple. All these Noble Phantasms are things I collected while I was alive."::
21630::$$$message_0194_0075_0000$$$::"Are you mocking me, Archer? That is even more absurd.[lr]::
21631::$$$message_0194_0075_0001$$$::No matter who you are, there is no way you can carry the Noble Phantasms unique to other Heroic Spirits. No such Heroic Spirit exists."::
21632::$$$message_0194_0076_0000$$$::Saber's right.[lr]::
21633::$$$message_0194_0076_0001$$$::All the Noble Phantasms he has are real.[lr]::
21634::$$$message_0194_0076_0002$$$::There are demonic swords from Northern Europe and even from South America.[lr]::
21635::$$$message_0194_0076_0003$$$::No hero ever made a name for themselves in so many regions. Besides, Lancer should be the only one with G치e Bolg.::
21636::$$$message_0194_0077_0000$$$::Heroic Spirits have their favorite weapon they used during their life as their Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
21637::$$$message_0194_0077_0001$$$::Based on that rule, the only one who could have G치e Bolg is C칰 Chulainn.::
21638::$$$message_0194_0078_0000$$$::But Archer isn't C칰 Chulainn.[lr]::
21639::$$$message_0194_0078_0001$$$::And that means his spear can't be G치e Bolg. But the thing is, it definitely [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] the real G치e Bolg.[lr]::
21640::$$$message_0194_0078_0002$$$::If those Noble Phantasms were all fake, that would explain it. But they're real, so that's just... No, wait...[lr]::
21641::$$$message_0194_0078_0003$$$::Could they all be originals...? The weapons' prototypes?::
21642::$$$message_0194_0079_0000$$$::"That seems impossible. But then again..."[lr]::
21643::$$$message_0194_0079_0001$$$::It might be possible.[lr]::
21644::$$$message_0194_0079_0002$$$::Legend and myth don't spring up from nothing.[lr]::
21645::$$$message_0194_0079_0003$$$::Plenty of myths share commonalities because someone or something served as the model for them.[lr]::
21646::$$$message_0194_0079_0004$$$::Legends which get to the point of becoming the basis of worship usually only take root in the lands where they are said to take place. That's one of the reasons demonic swords and sacred swords reveal their true abilities in the lands they come from.::
21647::$$$message_0194_0080_0000$$$::So let's say there's something from before even that.[lr]::
21648::$$$message_0194_0080_0001$$$::What if various Noble Phantasms in mythology existed before they were known and named?::
21649::$$$message_0194_0081_0000$$$::"Ah. Your Master's not entirely useless. He seems to have a notion of who I am."[lr]::
21650::$$$message_0194_0081_0001$$$::"Eh?"::
21651::$$$message_0194_0082_0000$$$::Saber turns to face me.[lr]::
21652::$$$message_0194_0082_0001$$$::She's so far away.[lr]::
21653::$$$message_0194_0082_0002$$$::I can't help her from so far away.[lr]::
21654::$$$message_0194_0082_0003$$$::I've finally gotten to the point where I can move, even if it's still difficult.::
21655::$$$message_0194_0083_0000$$$::"Run...Saber... His Noble Phantasms are..."::
21656::$$$message_0194_0084_0000$$$::"You're saying they're all real, right?[lr]::
21657::$$$message_0194_0084_0001$$$::Indeed. It really is simple, Saber.[lr]::
21658::$$$message_0194_0084_0002$$$::Let me tell you of the earliest days of Earth, when the world was still one.[lr]::
21659::$$$message_0194_0084_0003$$$::The single nation prospered, and its king collected so many, many treasures.[lr]::
21660::$$$message_0194_0084_0004$$$::...Until there was nothing left for him to collect; he lacked nothing.[lr]::
21661::$$$message_0194_0084_0005$$$::He possessed the perfect treasury, but he never used the weapons within it. The king carried them with him into eternal slumber."::
21662::$$$message_0194_0085_0000$$$::"That's all there is to it.[lr]::
21663::$$$message_0194_0085_0001$$$::After the king's death, the contents of the treasury were scattered around the world. Each was valued for being a truly exceptional weapon, so in time they came to be treated as Noble Phantasms.[lr]::
21664::$$$message_0194_0085_0002$$$::Hmph. Do you understand now, King of Knights?[lr]::
21665::$$$message_0194_0085_0003$$$::The Noble Phantasms you Servants use? They are nothing more than the king's own possessions."::
21666::$$$message_0194_0086_0000$$$::It's like an inheritance.[lr]::
21667::$$$message_0194_0086_0001$$$::As long as you trace an object's history, a base or prototype will always exist.[lr]::
21668::$$$message_0194_0086_0002$$$::It only makes sense that every legend, myth, or Noble Phantasm passed down in each country has an original.[lr]::
21669::$$$message_0194_0086_0003$$$::Far enough back into the past, if one person collected all those prototypes, they could possess every Noble Phantasm.::
21670::$$$message_0194_0087_0000$$$::And that could only be one hero.[lr]::
21671::$$$message_0194_0087_0001$$$::A hero from the oldest of legends, far older than the legend of King Arthur or Heracles.[lr]::
21672::$$$message_0194_0087_0002$$$::The tyrant who ruled ancient Mesopotamia...[lr]::
21673::$$$message_0194_0087_0003$$$::A king who was half-god, half-human...who collected all the world's treasures, and who eventually sought eternal youth..::
21674::$$$message_0194_0088_0000$$$::"Gilgamesh...the most ancient King of Heroes..."[lr]::
21675::$$$message_0194_0088_0001$$$::Saber sounds like she's trying to keep the fear from her voice.[lr]::
21676::$$$message_0194_0088_0002$$$::Gilgamesh relishes her reaction.::
21677::$$$message_0194_0089_0000$$$::"Indeed. I am the strongest Heroic spirit, and should you fight me, you will find you are no match for me."::
21678::$$$message_0194_0090_0000$$$::There's nothing else to discuss.[lr]::
21679::$$$message_0194_0090_0001$$$::All that's left now is for him to use his endless Noble Phantasms to annihilate his enemy.::
21680::$$$message_0194_0091_0000$$$::"Oh? Even knowing my name, you still intend to oppose me? You must understand you can't possibly win."[lr]::
21681::$$$message_0194_0091_0001$$$::"I will know nothing of the sort until I try.[lr]::
21682::$$$message_0194_0091_0002$$$::You may be the King of Heroes, but there must be something that even you cannot surpass."[lr]::
21683::$$$message_0194_0091_0003$$$::The air around Saber wavers.::
21684::$$$message_0194_0092_0000$$$::The wind envelops her as it picks up, becoming a whirlwind to protect her.[lr]::
21685::$$$message_0194_0092_0001$$$::As it does, her golden sword is revealed.[lr]::
21686::$$$message_0194_0092_0002$$$::"No, Saber."[lr]::
21687::$$$message_0194_0092_0003$$$::I don't believe this.[lr]::
21688::$$$message_0194_0092_0004$$$::Does Saber intend to use Excalibur!?::
21689::$$$message_0194_0093_0000$$$::Gilgamesh stops.[lr]::
21690::$$$message_0194_0093_0001$$$::He must know how powerful Saber's sacred sword is, because his self-assured composure falters.[lr]::
21691::$$$message_0194_0093_0002$$$::Saber glances toward me briefly, but her focus is on Gilgamesh now.::
21692::$$$message_0194_0094_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
21693::$$$message_0194_0094_0001$$$::Is she telling me to run away while I have the opportunity?[lr]::
21694::$$$message_0194_0094_0002$$$::Gilgamesh's back is to the river.[lr]::
21695::$$$message_0194_0094_0003$$$::While Saber is over here with me.[lr]::
21696::$$$message_0194_0094_0004$$$::This positioning must be the result of our shuffling around earlier.[lr]::
21697::$$$message_0194_0094_0005$$$::Before I realize what's happening, Saber is facing Gilgamesh, protecting me.::
21698::$$$message_0194_0095_0000$$$::"No. You can't. Not here."[lr]::
21699::$$$message_0194_0095_0001$$$::I try to force myself to move.[lr]::
21700::$$$message_0194_0095_0002$$$::And with all the strength I can muster in my numbed body, all I can manage is lifting a single arm.[lr]::
21701::$$$message_0194_0095_0003$$$::I use every bit of magical energy in my body to use that arm to push myself up.::
21702::$$$message_0194_0096_0000$$$::"Come...on...mngh...!"[lr]::
21703::$$$message_0194_0096_0001$$$::I've lost all sensation, but every bone in my body creaks as I begin moving.[lr]::
21704::$$$message_0194_0096_0002$$$::The pain is a warning.[lr]::
21705::$$$message_0194_0096_0003$$$::My body is coming apart at the seams, and if I move...that'll be it.::
21706::$$$message_0194_0097_0000$$$::"...Nnngh!"[lr]::
21707::$$$message_0194_0097_0001$$$::I push myself to my feet, ignoring the warning.[lr]::
21708::$$$message_0194_0097_0002$$$::"Ah...haaah...ha...aaah!"[lr]::
21709::$$$message_0194_0097_0003$$$::I try to endure the pain.[lr]::
21710::$$$message_0194_0097_0004$$$::I don't have time for it.[lr]::
21711::$$$message_0194_0097_0005$$$::What I need to do is get to my feet as fast as I can and protect Saber.::
21712::$$$message_0194_0098_0000$$$::I have a really, really bad feeling about this.[lr]::
21713::$$$message_0194_0098_0001$$$::It's the same premonition I felt when I faced Gilgamesh myself.[lr]::
21714::$$$message_0194_0098_0002$$$::We can't beat him, no matter what.[lr]::
21715::$$$message_0194_0098_0003$$$::My instincts keep telling me that I just can't let Saber fight him.::
21716::$$$message_0194_0099_0000$$$::"Hmph. The famed sacred sword. Very well."[lr]::
21717::$$$message_0194_0099_0001$$$::The swirling wind has become a raging vortex.[lr]::
21718::$$$message_0194_0099_0002$$$::Even in the face of that dazzling sword, Gilgamesh is unintimidated.::
21719::$$$message_0194_0100_0000$$$::On top of that...[lr]::
21720::$$$message_0194_0100_0001$$$::"I suppose I should select a weapon well-suited to oppose it."[lr]::
21721::$$$message_0194_0100_0002$$$::He draws a strange sword from the gate behind him.::
21722::$$$message_0194_0101_0000$$$::That's where my premonition came from.[lr]::
21723::$$$message_0194_0101_0001$$$::The sword he has now doesn't exist in any legend.[lr]::
21724::$$$message_0194_0101_0002$$$::I can identify every one of the Noble Phantasms floating behind him, but I have no idea about that sword.::
21725::$$$message_0194_0102_0000$$$::"I possess the originals of all the Noble Phantasms. But they are all nameless. They are also not the only weapons I possess."[lr]::
21726::$$$message_0194_0102_0001$$$::The sword itself is cylindrical.[lr]::
21727::$$$message_0194_0102_0002$$$::It consists of three segments, each rotating in different directions.[lr]::
21728::$$$message_0194_0102_0003$$$::It looks like a drill capable of piercing solid bedrock.::
21729::$$$message_0194_0103_0000$$$::"This is different, though. Only the King of Heroes may wield this sword.[lr]::
21730::$$$message_0194_0103_0001$$$::It has no name, so I simply call it Ea."::
21731::$$$message_0194_0104_0000$$$::"So all you want is to compare the strength of our Noble Phantasms?"[lr]::
21732::$$$message_0194_0104_0001$$$::Light flashes off their weapons.[lr]::
21733::$$$message_0194_0104_0002$$$::The two of them are still about ten meters apart.[lr]::
21734::$$$message_0194_0104_0003$$$::Gilgamesh can't possibly avoid her attacks from that distance.[lr]::
21735::$$$message_0194_0104_0004$$$::"Yes. There's no need to hold back now. I always wanted to go up against the sword they say is strongest."[lr]::
21736::$$$message_0194_0104_0005$$$::His laughter echoes in the space between them.[lr]::
21737::$$$message_0194_0104_0006$$$::Saber must have taken that as a provocation.::
21738::$$$message_0194_0105_0000$$$::"Very well.[lr]::
21739::$$$message_0194_0105_0001$$$::Then defend yourself against my sword, if you can!"[lr]::
21740::$$$message_0194_0105_0002$$$::Saber moves.[lr]::
21741::$$$message_0194_0105_0003$$$::Her lips form the sword's True Name.[lr]::
21742::$$$message_0194_0105_0004$$$::There's nowhere to run now.[lr]::
