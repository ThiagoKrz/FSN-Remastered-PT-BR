73238::$$$message_0672_0000_0000$$$::I wake up at the usual time.[lr]::
73239::$$$message_0672_0000_0001$$$::It isn't six o'clock yet.[lr]::
73240::$$$message_0672_0000_0002$$$::The dim sky is on the cusp of dawn, and covered in a gray blanket of clouds today.::
73241::$$$message_0672_0001_0000$$$::My left arm doesn't hurt.::
73242::$$$message_0672_0002_0000$$$::There's nobody in the living room.[lr]::
73243::$$$message_0672_0002_0001$$$::I should make breakfast before Tohsaka wakes up.::
73244::$$$message_0672_0003_0000$$$::The news is on TV.[lr]::
73245::$$$message_0672_0003_0001$$$::It's become our habit to check the TV every morning.::
73246::$$$message_0672_0004_0000$$$::"Nothing particularly conspicuous happened. It must not have come out last night."[lr]::
73247::$$$message_0672_0004_0001$$$::She means the black Shadow.[lr]::
73248::$$$message_0672_0004_0002$$$::"Uh-huh. I guess even that thing needs a day off."[lr]::
73249::$$$message_0672_0004_0003$$$::I answer glibly to hide my relief.::
73250::$$$message_0672_0005_0000$$$::"Yeah. It probably can't keep causing hundreds of victims for more than a couple of days in a row."::
73251::$$$message_0672_0006_0000$$$::It's past seven o'clock.[lr]::
73252::$$$message_0672_0006_0001$$$::Tohsaka and I are the only ones in the living room.[lr]::
73253::$$$message_0672_0006_0002$$$::Sakura and Illya are both still asleep.[lr]::
73254::$$$message_0672_0006_0003$$$::I wanted to go wake up Illya, but Tohsaka said to let her rest.::
73255::$$$message_0672_0007_0000$$$::"...You should rest to be ready for tonight."[lr]::
73256::$$$message_0672_0007_0001$$$::Tohsaka suddenly says that.[lr]::
73257::$$$message_0672_0007_0002$$$::"Why?"::
73258::$$$message_0672_0008_0000$$$::"Because you're going to make our secret weapon. We'll spend the entire day making the frame, and then Project it tonight.[lr]::
73259::$$$message_0672_0008_0001$$$::It's going to decide whether we win against Zouken. I'm not going to let any more innocent people get hurt. I have no idea what the Shadow is, but the Holy Grail War will end once we take out Zouken. That should cause the Shadow to disappear too."::
73260::$$$message_0672_0009_0000$$$::"You think the Shadow will disappear once the Holy Grail War is over?"::
73261::$$$message_0672_0010_0000$$$::"Yeah. Whatever's behind that thing, it's clearly after the Holy Grail.[lr]::
73262::$$$message_0672_0010_0001$$$::I don't know whether it wants the Holy Grail or if the Holy Grail summoned it. But if it was caused by the Holy Grail regardless, then it should disappear if the Grail is gone.[lr]::
73263::$$$message_0672_0010_0002$$$::It'll disappear once time runs out on the war, once there's only one Master left, or once the person meant to become the Holy Grail's vessel dies."::
73264::$$$message_0672_0011_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, you..."[lr]::
73265::$$$message_0672_0011_0001$$$::...Damn.[lr]::
73266::$$$message_0672_0011_0002$$$::She's known all along who the Shadow is, hasn't she.::
73267::$$$message_0672_0012_0000$$$::"I'm just speculating right now.[lr]::
73268::$$$message_0672_0012_0001$$$::Maybe it won't disappear even if we defeat Zouken.[lr]::
73269::$$$message_0672_0012_0002$$$::Maybe it won't disappear even if the Holy Grail War ends.[lr]::
73270::$$$message_0672_0012_0003$$$::But I'm going to take the surest method I know. We can't depend on a Holy Grail that we're not even sure we'll obtain. We have to do everything within our own power to defeat Zouken and the Shadow."::
73271::$$$message_0672_0013_0000$$$::With that, Tohsaka stands up.[lr]::
73272::$$$message_0672_0013_0001$$$::She takes the water pitcher and pajamas that I'd prepared for Sakura.::
73273::$$$message_0672_0014_0000$$$::"Hey. What are you trying to do with those?"[lr]::
73274::$$$message_0672_0014_0001$$$::"I'm going to keep an eye on Sakura. Her room's next to mine, so I'm the best person to look after her."[lr]::
73275::$$$message_0672_0014_0002$$$::"Mrgh. No, I should be the one to[line2]"::
73276::$$$message_0672_0015_0000$$$::"Don't be stupid, Shirou. You haven't been sleeping at all. It's going to be a problem for all of us if you stay in that condition."[lr]::
73277::$$$message_0672_0015_0001$$$::...?[lr]::
73278::$$$message_0672_0015_0002$$$::What does she mean, I haven't slept?::
73279::$$$message_0672_0016_0000$$$::"You're the one who sounds stupid. I got a full night's sleep yesterday."[lr]::
73280::$$$message_0672_0016_0001$$$::"Wow. I can't believe you still aren't aware of it.[lr]::
73281::$$$message_0672_0016_0002$$$::...If you think I'm lying, go take a look in the mirror. You're deathly pale and got rings around your eyes like a raccoon. I'm doing you a favor by taking care of Sakura."[lr]::
73282::$$$message_0672_0016_0003$$$::"Wha... Wait, really?"::
73283::$$$message_0672_0017_0000$$$::"Why would I lie to you about that? Just go rest in your room, man. I'll come get you once the sun goes down.[lr]::
73284::$$$message_0672_0017_0001$$$::Ah, if you can't sleep, I can give you a hand. ::
73285::$$$message_0672_0017_0002$$$::If you're okay with me copying what Rider did, I'll do you a favor that you'll regret the next day."::
73286::$$$message_0672_0018_0000$$$::She must be talking about Rider's Mystic Eyes, but as far as I know, Tohsaka doesn't have Mystic Eyes of her own.[lr]::
73287::$$$message_0672_0018_0001$$$::So, she's saying...::
73288::$$$message_0672_0019_0000$$$::"You mean you'll experiment on me?"[lr]::
73289::$$$message_0672_0019_0001$$$::"That's right. I wasn't really interested in them before, but Mystic Eyes don't seem so bad. I can't get on her level, obviously, but I might be able to improvise and hypnotize you to sleep."::
73290::$$$message_0672_0020_0000$$$::"Liar. I don't believe that for a second.[lr]::
73291::$$$message_0672_0020_0001$$$::You just wanna practice on me until you're satisfied!"::
73292::$$$message_0672_0021_0000$$$::"W-what's wrong with that!? So how about it, Shirou?[lr]::
73293::$$$message_0672_0021_0001$$$::Yes or no?"[lr]::
73294::$$$message_0672_0021_0002$$$::"[font italic=true]Hell no![font italic=false] I won't play along with your scary experiments, plus if I pass out in the middle of the day, I won't wake up until tomorrow."::
73295::$$$message_0672_0022_0000$$$::"Oh, right. If it goes too well, I might paralyze you instead of just putting you to sleep. You haven't got much of a resistance after all."[lr]::
73296::$$$message_0672_0022_0001$$$::Tohsaka nods at her own logic.[lr]::
73297::$$$message_0672_0022_0002$$$::I want to argue, but I won't because she'll probably just ask "so you wanna?"::
73298::$$$message_0672_0023_0000$$$::"I'm not that high-strung, anyway. I can sleep if I feel like it, so don't worry about me."[lr]::
73299::$$$message_0672_0023_0001$$$::"Okay. So you'll take a nap while I go watch Sakura?"[lr]::
73300::$$$message_0672_0023_0002$$$::Tohsaka does a 180 from her joking tone[lr]::
73301::$$$message_0672_0023_0003$$$::and fixes me with a serious gaze.::
73302::$$$message_0672_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
73303::$$$message_0672_0024_0001$$$::...I want to be at Sakura's side.[lr]::
73304::$$$message_0672_0024_0002$$$::I'd like to stay with her as much as I can, but there are things that need doing, and I shouldn't go see Sakura if I look as bad as Tohsaka says I do.[lr]::
73305::$$$message_0672_0024_0003$$$::I can trust Tohsaka to take good care of Sakura, so I'll accept her goodwill.::
73306::$$$message_0672_0025_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I'll be in my room for a little while.[lr]::
73307::$$$message_0672_0025_0001$$$::I'll bring lunch and dinner to her, but can I ask you to take care of her in the meantime?"[lr]::
73308::$$$message_0672_0025_0002$$$::"Sure, leave it to me. If she tries to move around at all, I'll scold her and make her go back to sleep.[lr]::
73309::$$$message_0672_0025_0003$$$::Can you really sleep on your own, though? Are you sure you don't want me to try something?"::
73310::$$$message_0672_0026_0000$$$::"You just don't give up. I refuse to go along with your sketchy plan.[lr]::
73311::$$$message_0672_0026_0001$$$::Still, thanks, Tohsaka. Sorry I made you worry."[lr]::
73312::$$$message_0672_0026_0002$$$::"I-it's not like I'm worried or anything! I'm going over now, so make sure you sleep, Shirou!"::
73313::$$$message_0672_0027_0000$$$::Honestly...[lr]::
73314::$$$message_0672_0027_0001$$$::Sometimes I can't tell if she's perceptive or oblivious, if she's nice or cold.[lr]::
73315::$$$message_0672_0027_0002$$$::I've heard that naturally gifted people tend to leave others in the dust, and maybe that applies to her, too.[lr]::
73316::$$$message_0672_0027_0003$$$::Sakura has it rough. If Tohsaka was my big sister, I'd never feel at ease with myself.::
73317::$$$message_0672_0028_0000$$$::"...I bet they would have a lot of fun every day, though."[lr]::
73318::$$$message_0672_0028_0001$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
73319::$$$message_0672_0028_0002$$$::That's why I want them to return to being sisters as much as possible.::
73320::$$$message_0672_0029_0000$$$::Once this war ends and the arrangement between the Tohsakas and Matous goes away, Sakura and Tohsaka can go back to being sisters.[lr]::
73321::$$$message_0672_0029_0001$$$::It won't be easy to overcome 11 years of separation, but I hope they can slowly close the distance and get along well enough to smile together without forcing themselves to.::
73322::$$$message_0672_0030_0000$$$::I'll do anything I can to help.[lr]::
73323::$$$message_0672_0030_0001$$$::I've thought this for a while, but I think this is the greatest gift we can give Sakura.::
73324::$$$message_0672_0031_0000$$$::"Oh, that goes for Tohsaka, too. I think Sakura's the only one who can make her worry the way she does now."[lr]::
73325::$$$message_0672_0031_0001$$$::Whoops.[lr]::
73326::$$$message_0672_0031_0002$$$::I catch myself imagining Tohsaka's happy, smiling face.[lr]::
73327::$$$message_0672_0031_0003$$$::Sorry, Sakura... this counts as cheating, doesn't it?::
73328::$$$message_0672_0032_0000$$$::"Ugh, never mind that."[lr]::
73329::$$$message_0672_0032_0001$$$::I can't keep wasting time.[lr]::
73330::$$$message_0672_0032_0002$$$::Tohsaka's going to challenge Zouken tonight.[lr]::
73331::$$$message_0672_0032_0003$$$::...That's not good.[lr]::
73332::$$$message_0672_0032_0004$$$::If Zouken goes down, the war will end.[lr]::
73333::$$$message_0672_0032_0005$$$::If the war ends, the Holy Grail will appear.[lr]::
73334::$$$message_0672_0032_0006$$$::To be more precise, it will [font italic=true]open[font italic=false].::
73335::$$$message_0672_0033_0000$$$::Zouken said the Holy Grail is some kind of gate.[lr]::
73336::$$$message_0672_0033_0001$$$::The thing that grants wishes isn't the Holy Grail itself, but whatever it contains.[lr]::
73337::$$$message_0672_0033_0002$$$::...IF that's true, then what will happen to Sakura, who's a Holy Grail?[lr]::
73338::$$$message_0672_0033_0003$$$::According to Illya,[lr]::
73339::$$$message_0672_0033_0004$$$::the closer the Holy Grail comes to completion, the more Sakura will cease to function as a human.::
73340::$$$message_0672_0034_0000$$$::"...Ngh."[lr]::
73341::$$$message_0672_0034_0001$$$::In the end, there's only one way to save her.[lr]::
73342::$$$message_0672_0034_0002$$$::I have to protect Sakura until the Holy Grail War is over.[lr]::
73343::$$$message_0672_0034_0003$$$::I don't know how exactly the Grail will manifest.[lr]::
73344::$$$message_0672_0034_0004$$$::It might show up once only one Master is left, or it might need the last Master to summon it.::
73345::$$$message_0672_0035_0000$$$::...If it's the latter, that won't be a problem.[lr]::
73346::$$$message_0672_0035_0001$$$::We can just defeat Zouken and remove the threat to Sakura, then wait out the time limit on the war.::
73347::$$$message_0672_0036_0000$$$::Tohsaka said that she'd challenge Zouken tonight.[lr]::
73348::$$$message_0672_0036_0001$$$::Which means that he can be beaten.[lr]::
73349::$$$message_0672_0036_0002$$$::She wouldn't say that unless we had a strong chance of victory.::
73350::$$$message_0672_0037_0000$$$::"That just leaves one question..."[lr]::
73351::$$$message_0672_0037_0001$$$::That black Shadow.[lr]::
73352::$$$message_0672_0037_0002$$$::It won't disappear just because Zouken's gone.[lr]::
73353::$$$message_0672_0037_0003$$$::It'll keep showing up as long as the Holy Grail, Sakura, is around.[lr]::
73354::$$$message_0672_0037_0004$$$::Many people will die each time it appears.[lr]::
73355::$$$message_0672_0037_0005$$$::Waiting the war out would mean allowing the Shadow to keep killing.::
73356::$$$message_0672_0038_0000$$$::"I...have to fight it. I'll beat the Shadow myself."[lr]::
73357::$$$message_0672_0038_0001$$$::...It's the only way.[lr]::
73358::$$$message_0672_0038_0002$$$::But can I beat it?[lr]::
73359::$$$message_0672_0038_0003$$$::If it's something that spilled out of the Holy Grail, then the Shadow itself probably has no concept of death.[lr]::
73360::$$$message_0672_0038_0004$$$::Even if I could erase it somehow, would that mean erasing the person projecting it[line2]Sakura[line2]or erasing whoever's providing power to the projector?::
73361::$$$message_0672_0039_0000$$$::"The person projecting it..."[lr]::
73362::$$$message_0672_0039_0001$$$::...I hope nobody like that exists.[lr]::
73363::$$$message_0672_0039_0002$$$::But I can't think of any other solutions.::
73364::$$$message_0672_0040_0000$$$::"The Holy Grail's contents.[lr]::
73365::$$$message_0672_0040_0001$$$::Zouken said that he planted broken pieces of the Holy Grail in Sakura after the war ten years ago. I wonder if that stuff existed back then, too..."[lr]::
73366::$$$message_0672_0040_0002$$$::    Oh.[lr]::
73367::$$$message_0672_0040_0003$$$::Hold on.[lr]::
73368::$$$message_0672_0040_0004$$$::Zouken said that the Crest Worms were created from the fragments of the Grail...::
73369::$$$message_0672_0041_0000$$$::"...Did Kotomine not notice...!?"[lr]::
73370::$$$message_0672_0041_0001$$$::There's no way...![lr]::
73371::$$$message_0672_0041_0002$$$::He extracted the Crest Worms from Sakura.[lr]::
73372::$$$message_0672_0041_0003$$$::He only managed to take out a few of them, but he did surgery to treat Sakura's body.::
73373::$$$message_0672_0042_0000$$$::There's no way he wouldn't have known at that point.[lr]::
73374::$$$message_0672_0042_0001$$$::Even if only in name, he's the Holy Grail War's overseer, and a Master who survived the previous war.[lr]::
73375::$$$message_0672_0042_0002$$$::Then he definitely would have noticed what was wrong with Sakura...!::
73376::$$$message_0672_0043_0000$$$::"Haaah!"[lr]::
73377::$$$message_0672_0043_0001$$$::I run out the front door.[lr]::
73378::$$$message_0672_0043_0002$$$::The sudden revelation takes hold of my body, and all I can think of is the priest's face.::
73379::$$$message_0672_0044_0000$$$::"Dammit! Why didn't I realize it sooner!?"[lr]::
73380::$$$message_0672_0044_0001$$$::I would have come to this conclusion if I'd just thought about it.[lr]::
73381::$$$message_0672_0044_0002$$$::Of course he would know what the Shadow that Sakura is unconsciously projecting is,[lr]::
73382::$$$message_0672_0044_0003$$$::and what exactly is inside the Holy Grail!::
