15617::$$$message_0144_0000_0000$$$::   I shouldn't be so apprehensive.[lr]::
15618::$$$message_0144_0000_0001$$$::We have Caster cornered.[lr]::
15619::$$$message_0144_0000_0002$$$::If we retreat, we're only giving Caster a chance to win.::
15620::$$$message_0144_0001_0000$$$::Saber's sword flashes in a blur of movement.[lr]::
15621::$$$message_0144_0001_0001$$$::She's closed the distance, and will likely cleave Caster in half with her next strike.::
15622::$$$message_0144_0001_0002$$$::   But.[lr]::
15623::$$$message_0144_0001_0003$$$::"Hngh!"[lr]::
15624::$$$message_0144_0001_0004$$$::Saber suddenly stops.[lr]::
15625::$$$message_0144_0001_0005$$$::It's nothing Caster has done. Saber's own instincts seem to be stopping her from getting closer.::
15626::$$$message_0144_0002_0000$$$::"You...that is...!"[lr]::
15627::$$$message_0144_0002_0001$$$::Saber twists away to dodge.[lr]::
15628::$$$message_0144_0002_0002$$$::Too late.[lr]::
15629::$$$message_0144_0002_0003$$$::She falters, as if something has lifted her upward. Then...::
15630::$$$message_0144_0002_0004$$$::A strange dagger plunges into her chest.::
15631::$$$message_0144_0003_0000$$$::"Ca...ster... You just...!"[lr]::
15632::$$$message_0144_0003_0001$$$::"Yes. This is my Noble Phantasm, Saber.[lr]::
15633::$$$message_0144_0003_0002$$$::It's a terribly weak weapon. It cannot create anything, and it certainly cannot kill a Servant, or even a human. However, it is imbued with an...indulgence from the Age of Gods, permitting it to and forgiving it for doing one very specific thing..."[lr]::
15634::$$$message_0144_0003_0003$$$::"Haah...Shi...rou...please run..."::
15635::$$$message_0144_0004_0000$$$::Saber isn't injured, but she collapses to her knees anyway.[lr]::
15636::$$$message_0144_0004_0001$$$::"Saber...!"[lr]::
15637::$$$message_0144_0004_0002$$$::Before I can figure out what's going on.[lr]::
15638::$$$message_0144_0004_0003$$$::The final Command Spell disappears from my left hand.::
15639::$$$message_0144_0005_0000$$$::"...Eh?"[lr]::
15640::$$$message_0144_0005_0001$$$::"This is just how I planned it, boy. Now, if I can just collect the mage and that vessel inside, my victory will be assured."[lr]::
15641::$$$message_0144_0005_0002$$$::Caster raises her hand.[lr]::
15642::$$$message_0144_0005_0003$$$::Even without her chanting, the air wavers...and blows me off my feet.::
15643::$$$message_0144_0005_0004$$$::"Ha...h!?"[lr]::
15644::$$$message_0144_0005_0005$$$::I can't get up.[lr]::
15645::$$$message_0144_0005_0006$$$::My legs are an absolute mess from that blow, and simply won't move.::
15646::$$$message_0144_0006_0000$$$::"It's about time.[lr]::
15647::$$$message_0144_0006_0001$$$::Now stand, Saber. Even if the gods punish you, I will forgive you."[lr]::
15648::$$$message_0144_0006_0002$$$::She snickers.[lr]::
15649::$$$message_0144_0006_0003$$$::Saber stands up.[lr]::
15650::$$$message_0144_0006_0004$$$::She walks in the same jerky manner as those bone soldiers, slowly approaching me as I lay immobile.::
15651::$$$message_0144_0007_0000$$$::Her eyes bulge like she's having a nightmare...as she swings her sword down.::
15652::$$$message_0144_0008_0000$$$::"Fufu...fu...ahahahahaha![lr]::
15653::$$$message_0144_0008_0001$$$::Wonderful, Saber. Now you and I will both bear the guilt of killing our own Masters! Yes, united in our crimes, we shall curse this earth till its death!::
15654::$$$message_0144_0009_0000$$$::Caster's laughter assaults my eardrums.[lr]::
15655::$$$message_0144_0009_0001$$$::Without even understanding what's going on, I feel my body go rigid.[lr]::
15656::$$$message_0144_0009_0002$$$::Crimson stains the night.[lr]::
15657::$$$message_0144_0009_0003$$$::Saber stares down at my blood-soaked body, her eyes filled with tears.::
