11811::$$$message_0117_0000_0000$$$::   I don't need to even think about it.[lr]::
11812::$$$message_0117_0000_0001$$$::And shit, even I only have so much patience.[lr]::
11813::$$$message_0117_0000_0002$$$::Every single one of them is sure Saber's going to disappear.[lr]::
11814::$$$message_0117_0000_0003$$$::Saber won't disappear; I'm going to fight with her until the end.[lr]::
11815::$$$message_0117_0000_0004$$$::I can't let this destroy the oath we made.::
11816::$$$message_0117_0001_0000$$$::"Illya. I can't do what you're asking me to. I have Saber. As long as Saber's around, I'm going to keep on fighting as a Master."::
11817::$$$message_0117_0002_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
11818::$$$message_0117_0002_0001$$$::A soft gasp.[lr]::
11819::$$$message_0117_0002_0002$$$::For a second, her red eyes snapped open as if she'd just gone into rigor mortis.::
11820::$$$message_0117_0003_0000$$$::"Oh... So you're going to betray me too, Shirou."[lr]::
11821::$$$message_0117_0003_0001$$$::Illya backs away.[lr]::
11822::$$$message_0117_0003_0002$$$::She looks down, but maintains her composure.::
11823::$$$message_0117_0004_0000$$$::"Fine. If you're not going to listen to me, I'm not going to listen to you, either.[lr]::
11824::$$$message_0117_0004_0001$$$::I've been letting you do whatever you want, but that ends now."[lr]::
11825::$$$message_0117_0004_0002$$$::Illya's voice is dripping with hostility now.[lr]::
11826::$$$message_0117_0004_0003$$$::There's something terrible lurking behind that malice.::
11827::$$$message_0117_0005_0000$$$::"Wait right here. I'll just be a minute."::
11828::$$$message_0117_0006_0000$$$::"Wait! What are you going to do, Illya!?"[lr]::
11829::$$$message_0117_0006_0001$$$::"Oh, nothing... I'm just going to go kill Saber and Rin. If I kill the two of them, that'd make you feel kind of guilty, right?"::
11830::$$$message_0117_0007_0000$$$::"Wha...? Don't be ridiculous! Saber and Tohsaka have nothing to do with this! I'm only saying I can't be with you for my own reasons!"::
11831::$$$message_0117_0008_0000$$$::"Oh really? Well, I'm still killing them. Once that's over, it'll be your turn. If you won't be mine, you're useless to me."::
11832::$$$message_0117_0009_0000$$$::I hear Illya's footsteps moving off.[lr]::
11833::$$$message_0117_0009_0001$$$::Illya's serious.[lr]::
11834::$$$message_0117_0009_0002$$$::She really means to go kill Saber and Tohsaka.::
11835::$$$message_0117_0010_0000$$$::"Stop, Illya! Saber and Tohsaka have nothing to do with this! I'm the one you captured, so if you're going to hate someone, just hate me! You don't need to kill them!"::
11836::$$$message_0117_0011_0000$$$::"I have a reason. I can't leave any other Master alive. Isn't that how Holy Grail Wars work?"[lr]::
11837::$$$message_0117_0011_0001$$$::"You dummy! Don't talk about killing people like it's so easy! You shouldn't ever do that! You're a kid! You shouldn't even be thinking about this kind of thing!"::
11838::$$$message_0117_0012_0000$$$::Illya stares at me in disbelief.[lr]::
11839::$$$message_0117_0012_0001$$$::"Too late. I've already killed a Master, brother."[lr]::
11840::$$$message_0117_0012_0002$$$::She sounds so joyful as she says it.::
11841::$$$message_0117_0013_0000$$$::"Yesterday, though. I thought you were going to take care of him, so I didn't expect to do it."::
11842::$$$message_0117_0014_0000$$$::"Wh...at?"[lr]::
11843::$$$message_0117_0014_0001$$$::In that instant...[lr]::
11844::$$$message_0117_0014_0002$$$::...I, surprisingly, understand exactly what she's talking about.[lr]::
11845::$$$message_0117_0014_0003$$$::Illya was in the building last night.[lr]::
11846::$$$message_0117_0014_0004$$$::Which means...[lr]::
11847::$$$message_0117_0014_0005$$$::...she must have seen the Master, running for his life, as the perfect prey.::
11848::$$$message_0117_0015_0000$$$::"Illya...you didn't..."[lr]::
11849::$$$message_0117_0015_0001$$$::"Sorry. I only did it because you didn't. I don't actually like taking other people's stuff."[lr]::
11850::$$$message_0117_0015_0002$$$::She doesn't sound guilty at all.[lr]::
11851::$$$message_0117_0015_0003$$$::It probably meant nothing to her.::
11852::$$$message_0117_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
11853::$$$message_0117_0016_0001$$$::It makes me realize something.[lr]::
11854::$$$message_0117_0016_0002$$$::...I've probably known this since the moment we first met.[lr]::
11855::$$$message_0117_0016_0003$$$::She really doesn't know the difference between good and evil.[lr]::
11856::$$$message_0117_0016_0004$$$::That innocent laugh is just as much Illya as the merciless laugh I hear now.[lr]::
11857::$$$message_0117_0016_0005$$$::It's not that Illya has a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other.[lr]::
11858::$$$message_0117_0016_0006$$$::Illya, however angelic she may look, [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] a devil.::
11859::$$$message_0117_0017_0000$$$::"Well, I'm off.[lr]::
11860::$$$message_0117_0017_0001$$$::When I get back, it'll be your turn, so do your best to escape."::
11861::$$$message_0117_0018_0000$$$::"Then again, a little bird in captivity will remain in captivity, because it can't escape.[lr]::
11862::$$$message_0117_0018_0001$$$::Knowing you, you won't be able to escape this little cage."::
11863::$$$message_0117_0019_0000$$$::Illya leaves.[lr]::
11864::$$$message_0117_0019_0001$$$::She is absolutely right of course.[lr]::
11865::$$$message_0117_0019_0002$$$::She knows nothing of threats or tactics, so she just...says what's true.[lr]::
11866::$$$message_0117_0019_0003$$$::But I can't stay here forever.[lr]::
11867::$$$message_0117_0019_0004$$$::I need to escape and meet up with Saber before Illya can attack her.::
11868::$$$message_0117_0020_0000$$$::"Ungh...!"[lr]::
11869::$$$message_0117_0020_0001$$$::I shake myself, trying to loosen the ropes around my wrists.[lr]::
11870::$$$message_0117_0020_0002$$$::Maybe she really doesn't think I can escape. There's no one else here.[lr]::
11871::$$$message_0117_0020_0003$$$::If I'm not being watched, even I can manage to get out of some ropes, but...::
11872::$$$message_0117_0021_0000$$$::"Damn...I still can't..."[lr]::
11873::$$$message_0117_0021_0001$$$::My body just won't listen to me.[lr]::
11874::$$$message_0117_0021_0002$$$::My limbs move, but they're heavy as lead, and just trying to move at all is exhausting.::
11875::$$$message_0117_0022_0000$$$::"Illya knew I couldn't escape because of this..."[lr]::
11876::$$$message_0117_0022_0001$$$::I can't move like this.[lr]::
11877::$$$message_0117_0022_0002$$$::Even if I get out of the rope, I won't be able to escape the room if I can hardly move.::
11878::$$$message_0117_0023_0000$$$::"My whole body feels heavy not because I'm tired... Yeah, I haven't been able to move since I looked into Illya's eyes."::
11879::$$$message_0117_0024_0000$$$::They must be Mystic Eyes.[lr]::
11880::$$$message_0117_0024_0001$$$::I hear truly superior mages can perform some sort of magecraft just by making eye contact with their target.[lr]::
11881::$$$message_0117_0024_0002$$$::Restraint is a common effect of Mystic Eyes, so that's probably what's going on here.::
11882::$$$message_0117_0025_0000$$$::Eyes are how we take in visual information, and so are susceptible to suggestion and spells.[lr]::
11883::$$$message_0117_0025_0001$$$::And that is why most mages employ some sort of protection on their eyes to block out other mages' magecraft.::
11884::$$$message_0117_0026_0000$$$::"Tohsaka would be so mad if she found out all it took to paralyze me was a suggestion, not even a spell..."::
11885::$$$message_0117_0027_0000$$$::...Well, at least that was from Mystic Eyes learned through magecraft.[lr]::
11886::$$$message_0117_0027_0001$$$::Some monsters are born with Mystic Eyes and don't even need to lock eyes with their target.[lr]::
11887::$$$message_0117_0027_0002$$$::I hear all they need to do is look to use whatever ability they have, but it's also extremely rare for people to have powers like that.::
11888::$$$message_0117_0028_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
11889::$$$message_0117_0028_0001$$$::Luckily, Illya's Mystic Eyes aren't unique or special. They're just a means of sending magical energy at a target.[lr]::
11890::$$$message_0117_0028_0002$$$::And that means there has to be a way to dispel the effect.[lr]::
11891::$$$message_0117_0028_0003$$$::Illya's magical energy is invading my nerves, preventing me from moving.[lr]::
11892::$$$message_0117_0028_0004$$$::If I can get rid of that magical energy, that should fix my paralysis.::
11893::$$$message_0117_0029_0000$$$::"It's simple. If there's a buildup of mud, then all I have to do is flush it out to clean it out."::
11894::$$$message_0117_0030_0000$$$::I close my eyes and focus inward, on my own body.[lr]::
11895::$$$message_0117_0030_0001$$$::I may not have the skill to detect and remove foreign magical energy that's invaded my body...[lr]::
11896::$$$message_0117_0030_0002$$$::But I don't need anything like that, so long as I'm dealing with magical energy that hasn't become a curse and taken root in my body.[lr]::
11897::$$$message_0117_0030_0003$$$::If Illya's magical energy is lingering, stagnant in my body, I just need a strong flow of magical energy through my body to flush it out."::
11898::$$$message_0117_0031_0000$$$::"Sorry...it's crude, but it's all I can do." [lr]::
11899::$$$message_0117_0031_0001$$$::I apologize to my body for what I'm about to put it through.::
11900::$$$message_0117_0032_0000$$$::All I have to do is focus on my daily routine.[lr]::
11901::$$$message_0117_0032_0001$$$::The ritual where I force a foreign nerve down my spine.[lr]::
11902::$$$message_0117_0032_0002$$$::No, not anymore.[lr]::
11903::$$$message_0117_0032_0003$$$::I don't need to build it from scratch anymore.[lr]::
11904::$$$message_0117_0032_0004$$$::Now all I have to do is flip the switch in my head.[lr]::
11905::$$$message_0117_0032_0005$$$::Instead of creating a Magic Circuit in my body, I just have to switch my nerves into a Magic Circuit.::
11906::$$$message_0117_0033_0000$$$::"Trace, on."[lr]::
11907::$$$message_0117_0033_0001$$$::I murmur the spell to focus myself.[lr]::
11908::$$$message_0117_0033_0002$$$::You don't use spells to change the world around you.[lr]::
11909::$$$message_0117_0033_0003$$$::They're to be used on yourself...to empower you to change the world.[lr]::
11910::$$$message_0117_0033_0004$$$::For mages, they're a way to initiate a kind of self-transformation.[lr]::
11911::$$$message_0117_0033_0005$$$::Spells are the first, most basic magecraft used to create a Mystic just for you...a command that will only work on you.::
11912::$$$message_0117_0034_0000$$$::"Basic structure...analysis."[lr]::
11913::$$$message_0117_0034_0001$$$::My blood flow accelerates.[lr]::
11914::$$$message_0117_0034_0002$$$::Power builds in my blood.[lr]::
11915::$$$message_0117_0034_0003$$$::My body is becoming a machine for circulating magical energy.[lr]::
11916::$$$message_0117_0034_0004$$$::...Probably thanks to the gem Tohsaka made me swallow.[lr]::
11917::$$$message_0117_0034_0005$$$::Normally, this would take me at least an hour. Now, I'm able to do it almost instantly.::
11918::$$$message_0117_0035_0000$$$::"Composition...analysis."[lr]::
11919::$$$message_0117_0035_0001$$$::I don't even need to flip the switch at this rate.[lr]::
11920::$$$message_0117_0035_0002$$$::I can just let the magical energy circulate and let my hands go.[lr]::
11921::$$$message_0117_0035_0003$$$::Actually...[lr]::
11922::$$$message_0117_0035_0004$$$::I say flip the switch, but I still haven't found the switch to begin with.::
11923::$$$message_0117_0036_0000$$$::Heat rushes into me.[lr]::
11924::$$$message_0117_0036_0001$$$::I try to get control over my pounding heart, and my hands slip from the bucking reins.::
11925::$$$message_0117_0037_0000$$$::"Gugh...!"[lr]::
11926::$$$message_0117_0037_0001$$$::Blood spurts from my mouth.[lr]::
11927::$$$message_0117_0037_0002$$$::I must have opened a vein, or torn something inside myself...[lr]::
11928::$$$message_0117_0037_0003$$$::I channeled enough magical energy to flush out the mud that had invaded me, so it's no wonder I'm throwing up blood. Luckily, I don't feel any pain.::
11929::$$$message_0117_0038_0000$$$::"Maybe I'm not in pain because of that self-healing thing I have..."[lr]::
11930::$$$message_0117_0038_0001$$$::It's an abnormality of my body that I still don't understand, but I'm delighted to have it at a time like this.[lr]::
11931::$$$message_0117_0038_0002$$$::The ability to heal any nonfatal wound is my biggest[line2]and only[line2]strength right now.::
11932::$$$message_0117_0039_0000$$$::I do need to be careful not to rely on it too much though.[lr]::
11933::$$$message_0117_0039_0001$$$::Since I still have no idea how it works, relying on it too much risks losing it all.[lr]::
11934::$$$message_0117_0039_0002$$$::So I can't rely on miracles I don't understand.::
11935::$$$message_0117_0040_0000$$$::"Okay. Now there's just the rope."[lr]::
11936::$$$message_0117_0040_0001$$$::I undo the rope.[lr]::
11937::$$$message_0117_0040_0002$$$::My wrists were bruised, but I wasn't bound tightly enough to cut off circulation.[lr]::
11938::$$$message_0117_0040_0003$$$::I don't think Illya tied me up, but I wasn't bound very tightly.[lr]::
11939::$$$message_0117_0040_0004$$$::Besides, I doubt it was Illya who carried me in here anyway.[lr]::
11940::$$$message_0117_0040_0005$$$::Who here, other than Illya, might not be all that strong?::
11941::$$$message_0117_0041_0000$$$::"It definitely wasn't Berserker. If he'd tied me up, he'd have snapped my hands right off."[lr]::
11942::$$$message_0117_0041_0001$$$::I rise to my feet as I try to crack a joke.[lr]::
11943::$$$message_0117_0041_0002$$$::"...Ouch."[lr]::
11944::$$$message_0117_0041_0003$$$::I can control my body, but I've pushed it too far.::
11945::$$$message_0117_0041_0004$$$::While I may not be injured, magical energy is raging through my body.[lr]::
11946::$$$message_0117_0041_0005$$$::Just moving around is likely to tear my insides up.[lr]::
11947::$$$message_0117_0041_0006$$$::...It's probably the pain.[lr]::
11948::$$$message_0117_0041_0007$$$::Dizziness and nausea wrack my entire body, and I have no feeling at the ends of my arms and legs.[lr]::
11949::$$$message_0117_0041_0008$$$::I'm not going to get home before Illya gets back, not like this...::
11950::$$$message_0117_0042_0000$$$::"Why am I being such a coward? I don't have time for that kind of thinking."[lr]::
11951::$$$message_0117_0042_0001$$$::I slap my cheeks and start walking.::
11952::$$$message_0117_0043_0000$$$::"What?"[lr]::
11953::$$$message_0117_0043_0001$$$::As soon as I lean against the wall and start toward the door...[lr]::
11954::$$$message_0117_0043_0002$$$::I hear something on the other side of the wall.[lr]::
11955::$$$message_0117_0043_0003$$$::Footsteps.[lr]::
11956::$$$message_0117_0043_0004$$$::More than one set of footsteps. People are approaching my door and talking. They stop right in front of my door.::
11957::$$$message_0117_0044_0000$$$::"Someone's on patrol!? Damn, and at the worst possible moment!"[lr]::
11958::$$$message_0117_0044_0001$$$::There's no time to hide.[lr]::
11959::$$$message_0117_0044_0002$$$::I need to...[lr]::
