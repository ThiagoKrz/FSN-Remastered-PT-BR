19607::$$$message_0181_0000_0001$$$::If she had been conscious, she would have seen that it was a black polar light.::

19609::$$$message_0181_0001_0001$$$::The darkness was momentary.[lr]::
19610::$$$message_0181_0001_0002$$$::But it was not darkness. It was a swarm of tiny curses.[lr]::
19611::$$$message_0181_0001_0003$$$::The darkness sweeps her body away, and the discomfort jolts her to wakefulness.::
19612::$$$message_0181_0002_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
19613::$$$message_0181_0002_0001$$$::I sigh.[lr]::
19614::$$$message_0181_0002_0002$$$::The first thing her returning consciousness brings her is pain.[lr]::
19615::$$$message_0181_0002_0003$$$::Whatever parts of her were not protected by her armor are horribly burned, and her flesh has been brutally savaged by blades of all sorts. She is a dismal sight.[lr]::

19617::$$$message_0181_0003_0000$$$::Ea defeated her.[lr]::
19618::$$$message_0181_0003_0001$$$::Gilgamesh unleashed his Noble Phantasms, and she could not defend against so many. Then Ea struck her.[lr]::
19619::$$$message_0181_0003_0002$$$::She barely managed to deflect it with Excalibur, but the damage to her body was too severe.[lr]::
19620::$$$message_0181_0003_0003$$$::Her wounds heal on their own without using magical energy, but even the protection of the sacred sword's sheath is unable to return her to full health in an instant.::
19621::$$$message_0181_0004_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
19622::$$$message_0181_0004_0001$$$::"This is it, Saber. I hope you are not still refusing to admit defeat, even in this state."[lr]::
19623::$$$message_0181_0004_0002$$$::Gilgamesh walks forward, not a scratch on his armor.::
19624::$$$message_0181_0005_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
19625::$$$message_0181_0005_0001$$$::Saber lays on the ground, looking up at her enemy.[lr]::
19626::$$$message_0181_0005_0002$$$::There's nothing she can do right now.[lr]::
19627::$$$message_0181_0005_0003$$$::Nothing can stop him from doing whatever he likes with her now.::
19628::$$$message_0181_0006_0000$$$::"Gilgamesh. What was that...light?"[lr]::
19629::$$$message_0181_0006_0001$$$::Despite the situation, Saber is more concerned about the light.[lr]::
19630::$$$message_0181_0006_0002$$$::That flash of light.[lr]::
19631::$$$message_0181_0006_0003$$$::That deep darkness that welled up from the far side of the temple and, for a moment, covered the world itself.[lr]::
19632::$$$message_0181_0006_0004$$$::She doesn't want to think about it, but that darkness might have been aimed at Shirou.::
19633::$$$message_0181_0007_0000$$$::"That light just now? You know. It's the curse.[lr]::
19634::$$$message_0181_0007_0001$$$::Kotomine must have summoned it straight from the Holy Grail. The Holy Grail apparently holds within it something capable of cursing the entire world.[lr]::
19635::$$$message_0181_0007_0002$$$::The pollution we've seen so far is nothing more than residue leaking from the Grail.[lr]::
19636::$$$message_0181_0007_0003$$$::And now, it seems, the main body has emerged. Your Master is dead."::
19637::$$$message_0181_0008_0000$$$::"That...can't be..."[lr]::
19638::$$$message_0181_0008_0001$$$::Saber wills her body to move.[lr]::
19639::$$$message_0181_0008_0002$$$::But she knows she can't.[lr]::
19640::$$$message_0181_0008_0003$$$::She can't just lay down, though...::
19641::$$$message_0181_0009_0000$$$::"Lies. Shirou is still alive. I can still..."[lr]::
19642::$$$message_0181_0009_0001$$$::She can still feel her connection with her Master.[lr]::
19643::$$$message_0181_0009_0002$$$::It's weak, like the faint embers of a fire on the verge of going out, but Shirou is alive.[lr]::
19644::$$$message_0181_0009_0003$$$::She has to keep going.[lr]::
19645::$$$message_0181_0009_0004$$$::If he fights something unheard of or incomprehensible, Shirou will be no match for it.::
19646::$$$message_0181_0010_0000$$$::"Kngh...!"[lr]::
19647::$$$message_0181_0010_0001$$$::Saber clings to that faint warmth and again wills herself to move.[lr]::
19648::$$$message_0181_0010_0002$$$::"Ah...kh...ah..."[lr]::
19649::$$$message_0181_0010_0003$$$::But it's useless.[lr]::
19650::$$$message_0181_0010_0004$$$::Even the sacred sword's sheath needs a few more minutes to restore her.::
19651::$$$message_0181_0011_0000$$$::"It's too late. Stay here, Saber.[lr]::
19652::$$$message_0181_0011_0001$$$::No matter what you do, the Holy Grail will soon overflow. It will be a repeat of ten years ago. This time, though, the ritual is for you, rather than me."[lr]::
19653::$$$message_0181_0011_0002$$$::The golden knight smiles as he turns his gaze up to the burning red sky.::
19654::$$$message_0181_0012_0000$$$::"Rejoice, Saber. Once the contents of the Grail have rained down upon you, you will become like me. You will gain flesh in this world and enjoy your second life.[lr]::
19655::$$$message_0181_0012_0001$$$::Of course, you may not retain your sanity as I have."[lr]::
19656::$$$message_0181_0012_0002$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
19657::$$$message_0181_0012_0003$$$::Saber looks up at him, bewildered.::
19658::$$$message_0181_0013_0000$$$::She can sense the immensity of the curse.[lr]::
19659::$$$message_0181_0013_0001$$$::It is a magnificent cluster of magical energy. With so much power, any magecraft would be possible. Were Caster to wield it, the possibilities would be endless.[lr]::
19660::$$$message_0181_0013_0002$$$::But it's a double-edged sword.[lr]::
19661::$$$message_0181_0013_0003$$$::It curses humans, and only humans.[lr]::
19662::$$$message_0181_0013_0004$$$::Even Heroic Spirits would not be able to remain themselves after coming into contact with that curse.::
19663::$$$message_0181_0014_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
19664::$$$message_0181_0014_0001$$$::That's when she realizes...[lr]::
19665::$$$message_0181_0014_0002$$$::...Gilgamesh...[lr]::
19666::$$$message_0181_0014_0003$$$::A decade ago, that corruption even swallowed up the most ancient King of Heroes.[lr]::
19667::$$$message_0181_0014_0004$$$::Then...[lr]::
19668::$$$message_0181_0014_0005$$$::"Gilgamesh...do not tell me you..."[lr]::
19669::$$$message_0181_0014_0006$$$::He's gone mad.::
19670::$$$message_0181_0015_0000$$$::"Oh? Do you think so, King of Knights?"[lr]::
19671::$$$message_0181_0015_0001$$$::Gilgamesh looks down at Saber, laughing merrily.[lr]::
19672::$$$message_0181_0015_0002$$$::It's strangely out of character for him, but the look seems somehow appropriate.::
19673::$$$message_0181_0016_0000$$$::"Do not underestimate me. How could I call myself a hero if I could not drink up something so paltry as a curse?[lr]::
19674::$$$message_0181_0016_0001$$$::All the world's evil? Hah. It is nowhere near potent enough to contaminate my glorious self![lr]::
19675::$$$message_0181_0016_0002$$$::Listen, Saber. A hero shoulders the weight of [font italic=true]all[font italic=false] humanity.[lr]::
19676::$$$message_0181_0016_0003$$$::And I did that eons ago."[lr]::
19677::$$$message_0181_0016_0004$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19678::$$$message_0181_0016_0005$$$::Hearing those words, Saber gasps.::
19679::$$$message_0181_0017_0000$$$::She knows, in that moment, that she will never understand this Heroic Spirit.[lr]::
19680::$$$message_0181_0017_0001$$$::His unthinkable arrogance, the staggering ego leading him to believe heaven and earth exist only for him, his ruthless choices that bear no regard for any but himself...[lr]::
19681::$$$message_0181_0017_0002$$$::All of these things are completely opposite to her own beliefs of what it is to be a king.[lr]::
19682::$$$message_0181_0017_0003$$$::But, he [font italic=true]was[font italic=false] a king.[lr]::
19683::$$$message_0181_0017_0004$$$::Even Saber cannot deny that.[lr]::
19684::$$$message_0181_0017_0005$$$::No other Servant than Gilgamesh could have retained their sense of self after being bathed in that immensely powerful curse.::
19685::$$$message_0181_0018_0000$$$::"Hm. Forcing you to swallow the mud may be entertaining, but once you lose your mind, my fun will be over. Let us resolve to be married before that happens."[lr]::
19686::$$$message_0181_0018_0001$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"::
19687::$$$message_0181_0019_0000$$$::"Gilgamesh...you are unbelievable!"[lr]::
19688::$$$message_0181_0019_0001$$$::"Oh? Do you dislike such rough treatment?[lr]::
19689::$$$message_0181_0019_0002$$$::You had best get used to it. I do not believe in restraint when it comes to women or food. I devour both as I please."[lr]::
19690::$$$message_0181_0019_0003$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
19691::$$$message_0181_0019_0004$$$::Saber glares up at Gilgamesh as she hangs upside down.::
19692::$$$message_0181_0020_0000$$$::"Hm. So you're acting out of a sense of duty to your Master, as a Servant. Pathetic. I can't believe you gave him your body and soul simply because of the constraints the Command Spells placed upon you."[lr]::
19693::$$$message_0181_0020_0001$$$::"No. You misunderstand, Gilgamesh.[lr]::
19694::$$$message_0181_0020_0002$$$::I do not obey anyone. That is a freedom I have never had."::
19695::$$$message_0181_0021_0000$$$::"Oh? So are you saying that you will not be mine, no matter what?"[lr]::
19696::$$$message_0181_0021_0001$$$::His red eyes rake over Saber.[lr]::
19697::$$$message_0181_0021_0002$$$::They are entirely devoid of human emotion.[lr]::
19698::$$$message_0181_0021_0003$$$::If she disobeys, he will kill her. No matter how attached he may be to something, if it does not obey him, he will simply destroy it.[lr]::
19699::$$$message_0181_0021_0004$$$::That is simply how Gilgamesh sees the world.::
19700::$$$message_0181_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19701::$$$message_0181_0022_0001$$$::Saber doesn't look away. She simply glares hatefully at Gilgamesh.::
19702::$$$message_0181_0023_0000$$$::"Gilgamesh. I will never be [font italic=true]anyone's[font italic=false] possession.[lr]::
19703::$$$message_0181_0023_0001$$$::I belong to my nation. I am a king before I am a woman."[lr]::
19704::$$$message_0181_0023_0002$$$::She's not saying this to anyone in particular.[lr]::
19705::$$$message_0181_0023_0003$$$::She's simply expressing the tiny warmth still within her heart.::
19706::$$$message_0181_0024_0000$$$::"Ha! Listen to you![lr]::
19707::$$$message_0181_0024_0001$$$::Do not make me laugh, Saber. A country is simply one of its king's possessions. If he cannot rule everything, a transcendent being like a king serves no purpose.[lr]::
19708::$$$message_0181_0024_0002$$$::Honestly. King Arthur...it is no wonder your own country turned on you."::
19709::$$$message_0181_0025_0000$$$::The golden knight mocks her for her naivete.[lr]::
19710::$$$message_0181_0025_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19711::$$$message_0181_0025_0002$$$::Her heart is set now.::
19712::$$$message_0181_0026_0000$$$::"Yes, you are correct. But listen, King of Heroes...[lr]::
19713::$$$message_0181_0026_0001$$$::Your arrogance is what destroyed [font italic=true]your[font italic=false] country!"[lr]::
19714::$$$message_0181_0026_0002$$$::Such fierce spirit.[lr]::
19715::$$$message_0181_0026_0003$$$::Saber twists her entire body, using the leverage to kick Gilgamesh in the face with her free leg!::
19716::$$$message_0181_0027_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
19717::$$$message_0181_0027_0001$$$::Gilgamesh releases her.[lr]::
19718::$$$message_0181_0027_0002$$$::Saber stretches her arms out and arrests her fall, then springs upward.::
19719::$$$message_0181_0028_0000$$$::"You dare kick a man!? It seems you really do require discipline! SABER!!!"::
19720::$$$message_0181_0029_0000$$$::She closes her eyes and looks within herself.[lr]::
19721::$$$message_0181_0029_0001$$$::[font italic=true]"It is no wonder your own country turned on you."[font italic=false][lr]::
19722::$$$message_0181_0029_0002$$$::It is not news to her.[lr]::
19723::$$$message_0181_0029_0003$$$::Since her summoning as a Saber, she's been hearing those words over and over.[lr]::
19724::$$$message_0181_0029_0004$$$::It's different with him.[lr]::
19725::$$$message_0181_0029_0005$$$::He grew angry with her as if it had been about him, but he also thought her actions were worthy of pride.::
19726::$$$message_0181_0030_0000$$$::She knows what she must do.[lr]::
19727::$$$message_0181_0030_0001$$$::Even if she has no hope of victory, she cannot stop here.[lr]::
19728::$$$message_0181_0030_0002$$$::She needs to do something while she can still feel that warmth inside her.[lr]::
19729::$$$message_0181_0030_0003$$$::She has to get to her Master as fast as she can.::
19730::$$$message_0181_0031_0000$$$::"Hnnngh!"[lr]::
19731::$$$message_0181_0031_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19732::$$$message_0181_0031_0002$$$::She's about eight meters from Gilgamesh.[lr]::
19733::$$$message_0181_0031_0003$$$::She positions herself at the ideal distance for intercepting an attack, which she's just experienced firsthand.::
19734::$$$message_0181_0032_0000$$$::Her body won't move the way she wants.[lr]::
19735::$$$message_0181_0032_0001$$$::She can barely grip her sword, and her legs are hardly able to bear her weight.[lr]::
19736::$$$message_0181_0032_0002$$$::Even a weak blow would be too much for her now.[lr]::
19737::$$$message_0181_0032_0003$$$::But she shows neither weakness nor hesitation.::
19738::$$$message_0181_0033_0000$$$::"...[lr]::
19739::$$$message_0181_0033_0001$$$::Let me ask you one thing."[lr]::
19740::$$$message_0181_0033_0002$$$::Even Gilgamesh feels he has to prepare himself.[lr]::
19741::$$$message_0181_0033_0003$$$::The golden knight readies Ea, his eyes on his opponent.::
19742::$$$message_0181_0034_0000$$$::"Are you quite insane?"[lr]::
19743::$$$message_0181_0034_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19744::$$$message_0181_0034_0002$$$::Saber doesn't answer.[lr]::
19745::$$$message_0181_0034_0003$$$::But her determination is there to see in her eyes.::
19746::$$$message_0181_0035_0000$$$::"Fine. Then I will not hold back."[lr]::
19747::$$$message_0181_0035_0001$$$::The air itself roars.[lr]::
19748::$$$message_0181_0035_0002$$$::Ea, the Sword of Rupture from ancient Mesopotamia, is said to have divided heaven and earth to create the world.::
19749::$$$message_0181_0036_0000$$$::Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes, readies his supreme sword to finally put an end to his enemy.[lr]::
19750::$$$message_0181_0036_0001$$$::The atmospheric vortex it creates[line2]the sheer quantity of converging magical energy[line2]far exceeds Saber's Excalibur.::

19752::$$$message_0181_0037_0001$$$::Gilgamesh raises his sword.[lr]::
19753::$$$message_0181_0037_0002$$$::Saber mirrors the movement in perfect synchronization.[lr]::

19760::$$$message_0181_0038_0003$$$::But Saber's sword falls to the ground, useless. She lacks the strength to activate her Noble Phantasm.::

19777::$$$message_0181_0046_0005$$$::All man's sins.[lr]::
19778::$$$message_0181_0046_0006$$$::I'm going to die.[lr]::
19779::$$$message_0181_0046_0007$$$::Anyone caught in this darkness wouldn't be able to resist letting it devour them, just from the sheer pain and disgust.::
19780::$$$message_0181_0047_0000$$$::But...[lr]::
19781::$$$message_0181_0047_0001$$$::Kotomine said it once.[lr]::
19782::$$$message_0181_0047_0002$$$::This curse is what killed Kiritsugu.[lr]::
19783::$$$message_0181_0047_0003$$$::That's enough to banish the darkness.::
19784::$$$message_0181_0048_0000$$$::Heat returns to my body.[lr]::
19785::$$$message_0181_0048_0001$$$::Blood rushes through me, wounded as I am, and helps me get back to my feet.[lr]::
19786::$$$message_0181_0048_0002$$$::And why not?[lr]::
19787::$$$message_0181_0048_0003$$$::I mean...[lr]::
19788::$$$message_0181_0048_0004$$$::Kiritsugu Emiya shouldered all of this for [font italic=true]years[font italic=false].[lr]::
19789::$$$message_0181_0048_0005$$$::Did he die, his own wishes unfulfilled, because those voices never stopped screaming at him to atone?::
19790::$$$message_0181_0049_0000$$$::He said he wanted to be a champion of justice.[lr]::
19791::$$$message_0181_0049_0001$$$::He ran around like an idiot trying to be useful to someone, and in the end, nobody let him do what he wanted to do. Even so, he still pursued something...the ideals he'd given up on.[lr]::
19792::$$$message_0181_0049_0002$$$::And then in the end, the words of some silly kid lifted a burden from him...and he finally let himself believe that everything would be okay.::
19793::$$$message_0181_0050_0000$$$::"Ah...aaa...ah..."[lr]::
19794::$$$message_0181_0050_0001$$$::I have to stand up.[lr]::
19795::$$$message_0181_0050_0002$$$::I said I was going to take his place and carry on his dream.[lr]::
19796::$$$message_0181_0050_0003$$$::If I really am the son of Kiritsugu Emiya, the champion of justice, I can't let the bad guy beat me.::
19797::$$$message_0181_0051_0000$$$::Tohsaka told me.[lr]::
19798::$$$message_0181_0051_0001$$$::I need to win even if it kills me.[lr]::
19799::$$$message_0181_0051_0002$$$::Saber told me.[lr]::
19800::$$$message_0181_0051_0003$$$::Kotomine is the enemy I have to defeat.[lr]::
19801::$$$message_0181_0051_0004$$$::Even Kotomine said...[lr]::
19802::$$$message_0181_0051_0005$$$::If I'm going to fight, I should put my life on the line.::
19803::$$$message_0181_0052_0000$$$::That's right. What [font italic=true]can[font italic=false] I put on the line here if not my life?[lr]::
19804::$$$message_0181_0052_0001$$$::I don't have anything else to offer anyway!::
19805::$$$message_0181_0053_0000$$$::"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!"[lr]::
19806::$$$message_0181_0053_0001$$$::I desperately leap out of the mass of black mud.[lr]::
19807::$$$message_0181_0053_0002$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
19808::$$$message_0181_0053_0003$$$::I can hear his surprise.::
19809::$$$message_0181_0054_0000$$$::My throat is burning.[lr]::
19810::$$$message_0181_0054_0001$$$::Every breath is like swallowing glass.::
19811::$$$message_0181_0055_0000$$$::"Hgggh...gh...abbbh...ah..."[lr]::
19812::$$$message_0181_0055_0001$$$::I don't care.[lr]::
19813::$$$message_0181_0055_0002$$$::Tears of frustration stream down my face.[lr]::
19814::$$$message_0181_0055_0003$$$::I might just burst from sheer anger before the curse can tear me apart.::
19815::$$$message_0181_0056_0000$$$::"Impossible. Have you truly just shaken the curse off!?"::
19816::$$$message_0181_0057_0000$$$::"Hnnngh!"[lr]::
19817::$$$message_0181_0057_0001$$$::I push my body, forcing it to run.[lr]::
19818::$$$message_0181_0057_0002$$$::One hand goes behind my back.[lr]::
19819::$$$message_0181_0057_0003$$$::I grip the dagger I've been concealing this whole time.::
19820::$$$message_0181_0058_0000$$$::"Unbelievable. You manage to escape and your next action is so pathetically foolish. I suppose you must simply have run out of ideas."[lr]::
19821::$$$message_0181_0058_0001$$$::"Shut your damn mouth! I never had a plan in the first place!!!"[lr]::
19822::$$$message_0181_0058_0002$$$::I run.[lr]::
19823::$$$message_0181_0058_0003$$$::Kotomine sticks his hand into the waterfall behind him and draws out another lump of darkness.::
19824::$$$message_0181_0059_0000$$$::"Then you can follow your Servant. That light that you saw earlier was Saber's defeat. You have no one to help you now."[lr]::
19825::$$$message_0181_0059_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19826::$$$message_0181_0059_0002$$$::There's no more hesitation now.[lr]::
19827::$$$message_0181_0059_0003$$$::If I get my hands on Kotomine, he will regret what he's just said more than anything else.::
19828::$$$message_0181_0060_0000$$$::I still have a Command Spell on my left hand.[lr]::
19829::$$$message_0181_0060_0001$$$::I don't know if I'm alive or dead...but [font italic=true]that[font italic=false] is the proof...and I can feel the truth of it.::
19830::$$$message_0181_0061_0000$$$::As long as I still have my Command Spell, Saber's still with me.[lr]::
19831::$$$message_0181_0061_0001$$$::If she's still here...she must have defeated Gilgamesh and be headed to me right now.[lr]::
19832::$$$message_0181_0061_0002$$$::And if I don't greet her with open arms when that happens, well, I know her enough to know she'll be mad.[lr]::
19833::$$$message_0181_0061_0003$$$::[font italic=true]So I'm going to beat you here and now.[font italic=false][lr]::
19834::$$$message_0181_0061_0004$$$::[font italic=true]...To fulfill the promise I made to her.[font italic=false]::
19835::$$$message_0181_0062_0000$$$::Darkness closes in on me.[lr]::
19836::$$$message_0181_0062_0001$$$::Kotomine releases a giant mass of curse.[lr]::
19837::$$$message_0181_0062_0002$$$::My body begins to crumble, starting with the extremities.[lr]::
19838::$$$message_0181_0062_0003$$$::"NGHGGG!"[lr]::
19839::$$$message_0181_0062_0004$$$::I won't look away.[lr]::
19840::$$$message_0181_0062_0005$$$::If this is my role...I'm not done yet!::
19841::$$$message_0181_0063_0000$$$::"Enuma Elish!!!"[lr]::
19842::$$$message_0181_0063_0001$$$::A fault line splits space itself.[lr]::
19843::$$$message_0181_0063_0002$$$::With a flash of light and a roar of wind, Ea releases a vortex of pure destruction.::
19844::$$$message_0181_0064_0000$$$::"...Kngh...!"[lr]::
19845::$$$message_0181_0064_0001$$$::The sheer intensity prevents Saber from using her own Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
19846::$$$message_0181_0064_0002$$$::So she lowers her sword and lets herself sway as if collapsing.::
19847::$$$message_0181_0065_0000$$$::The light draws near.[lr]::
19848::$$$message_0181_0065_0001$$$::Saber's too injured to dodge, and there is no shield capable of defending against Ea's attack.[lr]::
19849::$$$message_0181_0065_0002$$$::That furious dance of light and wind can only annihilate everything in its path.[lr]::
19850::$$$message_0181_0065_0003$$$::Nothing can stand up to Ea.[lr]::
19851::$$$message_0181_0065_0004$$$::It is an immutable fact.[lr]::
19852::$$$message_0181_0065_0005$$$::Both of them knew it to be true...[lr]::
19853::$$$message_0181_0065_0006$$$::...a few hours ago.::
19854::$$$message_0181_0066_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
19855::$$$message_0181_0066_0001$$$::For once, that astonished cry comes not from Saber, but from the golden knight wielding Ea.[lr]::
19856::$$$message_0181_0066_0002$$$::Ea continues to release its torrent of magical energy, unleashing a ravening beam of destruction.[lr]::
19857::$$$message_0181_0066_0003$$$::But Saber is on her feet...stepping [font italic=true]into[font italic=false] the light of Ea's power.::
19858::$$$message_0181_0067_0000$$$::"Hnnngh!"[lr]::
19859::$$$message_0181_0067_0001$$$::Her silver armor screams.[lr]::
19860::$$$message_0181_0067_0002$$$::Cracks splinter every layer of magical energy protecting her.[lr]::
19861::$$$message_0181_0067_0003$$$::With not a second to lose, she closes the gap between herself and Gilgamesh.[lr]::
19862::$$$message_0181_0067_0004$$$::"EXCALIBUR!!!"[lr]::
19863::$$$message_0181_0067_0005$$$::To counter Ea's destruction, Saber releases every drop of power at her command.::
19864::$$$message_0181_0068_0000$$$::Searching heat scorches the earth in all directions in a brilliant flash of light.[lr]::
19865::$$$message_0181_0068_0001$$$::Two titanically powerful swords clash, their power so vast it creates a visible border as the two struggle against each other.[lr]::
19866::$$$message_0181_0068_0002$$$::But...is it all for nothing?[lr]::
19867::$$$message_0181_0068_0003$$$::Excalibur cannot beat Ea.[lr]::
19868::$$$message_0181_0068_0004$$$::Even if Saber risks her life and attacks without concern for the consequences, she can only push back just the smallest bit.[lr]::
19869::$$$message_0181_0068_0005$$$::The scales tilt in favor of Ea, and Excalibur's light weakens, pushing Saber back.::
19870::$$$message_0181_0069_0000$$$::"I see. So you [font italic=true]have[font italic=false] lost your mind, Saber!"[lr]::
19871::$$$message_0181_0069_0001$$$::The golden knight draws Ea back, but then sees his enemy's renewed, reckless advance. So he pours yet more magical energy into Ea.[lr]::
19872::$$$message_0181_0069_0002$$$::There's no turning back now.[lr]::
19873::$$$message_0181_0069_0003$$$::All there is to do is use his full power to utterly annihilate Saber.[lr]::
19874::$$$message_0181_0069_0004$$$::Ea's segments spin faster, faster, [font italic=true]faster[font italic=false], reaching their maximum speed, and the light that envelops Saber cuts Excalibur down.::
19875::$$$message_0181_0070_0000$$$::But in the instant before that happens...[lr]::
19876::$$$message_0181_0070_0001$$$::Saber charges.[lr]::
19877::$$$message_0181_0070_0002$$$::A tiny opening created by Excalibur's power allows her to take a single step closer.[lr]::
19878::$$$message_0181_0070_0003$$$::In the instant she reaches that space...[lr]::
19879::$$$message_0181_0070_0004$$$::...her Noble Phantasm appears.::
19880::$$$message_0181_0071_0000$$$::Darkness buffets Shirou as if he were caught in a wind tunnel.[lr]::
19881::$$$message_0181_0071_0001$$$::There is no avoiding or deflecting darkness that coats space itself.[lr]::
19882::$$$message_0181_0071_0002$$$::Those swallowed by the darkness can only be consumed by it.::
19883::$$$message_0181_0072_0000$$$::"Tchhh...ah...!"[lr]::
19884::$$$message_0181_0072_0001$$$::He's corroding from the fingertips inward.[lr]::
19885::$$$message_0181_0072_0002$$$::His legs kick at the air as if swimming. His outstretched arms are swallowed up in the black mud. His vision fails him.[lr]::
19886::$$$message_0181_0072_0003$$$::It's like being erased.[lr]::
19887::$$$message_0181_0072_0004$$$::Shirou feels himself shrinking, but he refuses to die.::
19888::$$$message_0181_0073_0000$$$::"Ha...ah...gh!"[lr]::
19889::$$$message_0181_0073_0001$$$::He tries not to look away, pours every ounce of strength he has into resisting.[lr]::
19890::$$$message_0181_0073_0002$$$::He fights the darkness covering him, the pain trying to melt his body, and the curse trying to dissolve his mind.[lr]::
19891::$$$message_0181_0073_0003$$$::"Tch...ngh...!"[lr]::
19892::$$$message_0181_0073_0004$$$::It's all in vain.[lr]::
19893::$$$message_0181_0073_0005$$$::No human could resist this corruption.[lr]::
19894::$$$message_0181_0073_0006$$$::And yet he continues to move.[lr]::
19895::$$$message_0181_0073_0007$$$::His arm is still raised, held out, trying to grab something.::
19896::$$$message_0181_0074_0000$$$::But his heart is already broken.[lr]::
19897::$$$message_0181_0074_0001$$$::His thoughts are smothered in darkness, and soon it will consume him.[lr]::
19898::$$$message_0181_0074_0002$$$::But in that moment...[lr]::
19899::$$$message_0181_0074_0003$$$::                                                 [font italic=true]"You are my..."[font italic=false][lr]::
19900::$$$message_0181_0074_0004$$$::Why did he remember that voice?::
19901::$$$message_0181_0075_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19902::$$$message_0181_0075_0001$$$::A light in the darkness.[lr]::
19903::$$$message_0181_0075_0002$$$::The moment he realizes it's [font italic=true]that[font italic=false] light, everything runs in reverse.[lr]::
19904::$$$message_0181_0075_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19905::$$$message_0181_0075_0004$$$::The switch flips.[lr]::
19906::$$$message_0181_0075_0005$$$::His thoughts gain speed, creating crackling sparks, and form the shape with astonishing speed.::
19907::$$$message_0181_0076_0000$$$::"Trace, on."[lr]::
19908::$$$message_0181_0076_0001$$$::He murmurs the spell to begin Projection.[lr]::
19909::$$$message_0181_0076_0002$$$::In that instant...[lr]::
19910::$$$message_0181_0076_0003$$$::It's complete...skipping every step of the manufacturing process.[lr]::
19911::$$$message_0181_0076_0004$$$::He didn't need to reproduce it from scratch.[lr]::
19912::$$$message_0181_0076_0005$$$::The shape had already been engraved onto his very soul. It had been a part of Shirou Emiya for so, so long that he'd perfectly memorized it.::
19913::$$$message_0181_0077_0000$$$::                                                 [font italic=true]"You were my sheath."[font italic=false]::
19914::$$$message_0181_0078_0000$$$::His fingertips, desperately reaching, move again.[lr]::
19915::$$$message_0181_0078_0001$$$::They grab hold of the object he created without concentration or spellcasting.[lr]::
19916::$$$message_0181_0078_0002$$$::The world turns on its head, darkness eradicated by golden light. In Shirou's grasp, duplicated flawlessly, is Saber's sheath.::
19917::$$$message_0181_0079_0000$$$::And so...[lr]::
19918::$$$message_0181_0079_0001$$$::As Ea's all-destroying light burns away everything in its path, Saber releases her own Noble Phantasm.::
19919::$$$message_0181_0080_0000$$$::"Wha...t!?"[lr]::
19920::$$$message_0181_0080_0001$$$::What appears before her is, without question, the sacred sword's sheath.::
19921::$$$message_0181_0081_0000$$$::The Mystics which shroud it are unknown, but the sheath repels Ea's light.[lr]::
19922::$$$message_0181_0081_0001$$$::No, this is beyond simply defending its wielder.::
19923::$$$message_0181_0082_0000$$$::Instead, it cuts her off completely.[lr]::
19924::$$$message_0181_0082_0001$$$::The wall that keeps the filth of the outside world from fairyland, a world that cannot be reached, forever isolated from the rest of the world...[lr]::
19925::$$$message_0181_0082_0002$$$::Saber is protected by the sheath of the sacred sword, and for a moment, she exists apart from all reason and logic in this world.[lr]::
19926::$$$message_0181_0082_0003$$$::It is the greatest protection in the world.[lr]::
19927::$$$message_0181_0082_0004$$$::Nothing, not even the Five Magics, can pierce this perfect defense.::
19928::$$$message_0181_0083_0000$$$::And so, the sheath is named Avalon.[lr]::
19929::$$$message_0181_0083_0001$$$::Avalon. It is the place King Arthur is said to have gone after dying...the utopia the king dreamed of, but could not yet reach.::
19930::$$$message_0181_0084_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19931::$$$message_0181_0084_0001$$$::Gilgamesh sees the grim reaper raising its scythe.[lr]::
19932::$$$message_0181_0084_0002$$$::But it's too late.[lr]::
19933::$$$message_0181_0084_0003$$$::Ea won't stop rotating, and Gilgamesh can't retreat.[lr]::
19934::$$$message_0181_0084_0004$$$::How could he?[lr]::
19935::$$$message_0181_0084_0005$$$::Who could ever have believed an attack with so much magical energy, such unimaginable [font italic=true]power[font italic=false], could ever be blocked?::
19936::$$$message_0181_0085_0000$$$::"Hnnngh! How dare you stoop to such a petty trick!?"[lr]::
19937::$$$message_0181_0085_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19938::$$$message_0181_0085_0002$$$::A streak of blue surges forward.[lr]::
19939::$$$message_0181_0085_0003$$$::Saber's armor is gone.[lr]::
19940::$$$message_0181_0085_0004$$$::She's shed her armor so she can use its magical energy in her sword.::

19953::$$$message_0181_0090_0003$$$::The priest, so assured of his own strength, and the boy who could afford no such arrogance, face off.[lr]::
19954::$$$message_0181_0090_0004$$$::It is but an instant, but that instant decides the battle.::

19956::$$$message_0181_0091_0001$$$::Shirou Emiya runs, sometimes stumbling onto all fours.[lr]::
19957::$$$message_0181_0091_0002$$$::In one hand, he holds the dagger.[lr]::
19958::$$$message_0181_0091_0003$$$::He scrambles forward on his hands and knees toward the priest.::
19959::$$$message_0181_0092_0000$$$::"Hnnnnnnnnngh!"[lr]::
19960::$$$message_0181_0092_0001$$$::Shirou doesn't stop. He thrusts the dagger of retribution into the priest's chest.::
19961::$$$message_0181_0093_0000$$$::"...Gghggg."[lr]::
19962::$$$message_0181_0093_0001$$$::The priest turns slowly.[lr]::
19963::$$$message_0181_0093_0002$$$::Before he can leave...[lr]::
19964::$$$message_0181_0093_0003$$$::Shirou steps down on one foot to ground himself, and turns in a circle using the momentum of his dash.::
19965::$$$message_0181_0094_0000$$$::He inverts himself like a top, and he floods his left hand with magical energy.[lr]::
19966::$$$message_0181_0094_0001$$$::And, like a whirlwind...[lr]::
19967::$$$message_0181_0094_0002$$$::"L√§√üt!"[lr]::
19968::$$$message_0181_0094_0003$$$::His magical energy pours into the Azoth Blade, along with the word to trigger its release.::
19969::$$$message_0181_0095_0000$$$::Saber swings her golden sword.[lr]::
19970::$$$message_0181_0095_0001$$$::She must not have had the energy to push herself back up.[lr]::
19971::$$$message_0181_0095_0002$$$::Saber keeps her sword down, head down.[lr]::
19972::$$$message_0181_0095_0003$$$::Gilgamesh stares, wide-eyed at the knight...as she cuts him in half.::
19973::$$$message_0181_0096_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19974::$$$message_0181_0096_0001$$$::In the silence after, the wind whispers through the compound.[lr]::
19975::$$$message_0181_0096_0002$$$::There remains not a trace of the light that had flooded the area seconds ago.[lr]::
19976::$$$message_0181_0096_0003$$$::The two knights do not exchange words. They simply stand, facing each other, as the battle ends.::
19977::$$$message_0181_0097_0000$$$::"...Ngh."[lr]::
19978::$$$message_0181_0097_0001$$$::Gilgamesh sighs.[lr]::
19979::$$$message_0181_0097_0002$$$::He lifts a hand and traces a finger along her cheek, as if to check the knight.::
19980::$$$message_0181_0098_0000$$$::"Such an impudent woman. You opposed me to the very end."[lr]::
19981::$$$message_0181_0098_0001$$$::His golden armor begins to fade.[lr]::
19982::$$$message_0181_0098_0002$$$::The bloody King of Heroes, starts to disappear.[lr]::
19983::$$$message_0181_0098_0003$$$::"But I shall forgive you. Some things are beautiful precisely because they are unattainable."::
19984::$$$message_0181_0099_0000$$$::His finger slips away from her.[lr]::
19985::$$$message_0181_0099_0001$$$::The arm he'd raised to touch her falls weakly.[lr]::
19986::$$$message_0181_0099_0002$$$::"Hm. I suppose it was inevitable, then, that I would lose to you."::
19987::$$$message_0181_0100_0000$$$::He clicks his tongue in displeasure.[lr]::
19988::$$$message_0181_0100_0001$$$::And then, at the end...[lr]::
19989::$$$message_0181_0100_0002$$$::"Farewell, King of Knights. It was certainly entertaining."[lr]::
19990::$$$message_0181_0100_0003$$$::He smiles ironically...and vanishes.::
19991::$$$message_0181_0101_0000$$$::Pale blue sparks flicker along the priest's form.[lr]::
19992::$$$message_0181_0101_0001$$$::They spread in all directions from where the dagger protrudes from his chest.[lr]::
19993::$$$message_0181_0101_0002$$$::No flesh falls away, and there is no sign of bleeding.[lr]::
19994::$$$message_0181_0101_0003$$$::Even so, the battle comes to an end.::
19995::$$$message_0181_0102_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19996::$$$message_0181_0102_0001$$$::He's not even looking at me.[lr]::
19997::$$$message_0181_0102_0002$$$::Instead, he stares down at the dagger in his chest in confusion.::
19998::$$$message_0181_0103_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19999::$$$message_0181_0103_0001$$$::The wind is blowing.[lr]::
20000::$$$message_0181_0103_0002$$$::A gust of wind blows from the hollow overhead, muffling the sound around him.[lr]::
20001::$$$message_0181_0103_0003$$$::In the silence that follows...[lr]::
20002::$$$message_0181_0103_0004$$$::"Why do you have that sword?"[lr]::
20003::$$$message_0181_0103_0005$$$::Kotomine's voice is low, mumbling.::
20004::$$$message_0181_0104_0000$$$::"It's not mine. Tohsaka lent it to me."[lr]::
20005::$$$message_0181_0104_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20006::$$$message_0181_0104_0002$$$::I'm not sure how long he was thinking.[lr]::
20007::$$$message_0181_0104_0003$$$::He takes a deep breath and finally moves, having been motionless from the moment I charged him and impaled him with the blade.::
20008::$$$message_0181_0105_0000$$$::"I see. I once gave it to some girl as a gift, maybe ten years ago.[lr]::
20009::$$$message_0181_0105_0001$$$::Yes... No wonder I've gotten so weak."[lr]::
20010::$$$message_0181_0105_0002$$$::Kotomine collapses.::
20011::$$$message_0181_0106_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20012::$$$message_0181_0106_0001$$$::I watch it all unfold.[lr]::
20013::$$$message_0181_0106_0002$$$::Even on the brink of death, he spoke of himself as if he were talking about someone else.[lr]::
20014::$$$message_0181_0106_0003$$$::Finally, the priest sinks into that which he summoned, the very thing he wished for.::
20015::$$$message_0181_0107_0000$$$::                                 And that is the end of Kirei Kotomine.::
20016::$$$message_0181_0108_0000$$$::                                        The true end of a long battle.::ñﬂ
