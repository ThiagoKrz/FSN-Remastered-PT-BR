53560::$$$message_0464_0000_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]Caster isn't gone?"[lr]::
53561::$$$message_0464_0000_0001$$$::"Nope. You defeated her two days ago, right?[lr]::
53562::$$$message_0464_0000_0002$$$::But there were more comas yesterday.[lr]::
53563::$$$message_0464_0000_0003$$$::...And the people who got drained are in even worse condition than before."::
53564::$$$message_0464_0001_0000$$$::"That can't be right. I'm sure we..."[lr]::
53565::$$$message_0464_0001_0001$$$::"I know. You wouldn't lie about that, and I don't think you misunderstood what you saw, either. But Archer and I saw a shadow that looks like Caster when we rushed to the scene of the attacks yesterday."::
53566::$$$message_0464_0002_0000$$$::"...I see. Then, is Caster really still alive and gathering energy from the town?"::
53567::$$$message_0464_0003_0000$$$::"I can't say for sure, but yeah. I also felt Ryudou Temple's aura change.[lr]::
53568::$$$message_0464_0003_0001$$$::You and Saber defeated Caster. But Caster still exists. That's all I know for certain."::
53569::$$$message_0464_0004_0000$$$::...That must be why Tohsaka has been acting odd since yesterday.::
53570::$$$message_0464_0005_0000$$$::She probably started having doubts about this war.[lr]::
53571::$$$message_0464_0005_0001$$$::A Servant is supposed to disappear when its Master is beaten.[lr]::
53572::$$$message_0464_0005_0002$$$::When a Servant is completely defeated, it can't escape death in this world.[lr]::
53573::$$$message_0464_0005_0003$$$::Both penalties apply to Caster, and yet she somehow still exists.[lr]::
53574::$$$message_0464_0005_0004$$$::It's a clear, fundamental violation of the rules underpinning the Holy Grail War.::
53575::$$$message_0464_0006_0000$$$::"Okay. So what do you think?"[lr]::
53576::$$$message_0464_0006_0001$$$::"Huh? Me?"::
53577::$$$message_0464_0007_0000$$$::"Yeah. It's crazy, right?[lr]::
53578::$$$message_0464_0007_0001$$$::I doubt you're going to forfeit this war. I'm guessing you care more about cleaning up Caster's mess than the competition itself, even if it means putting off dueling the other Masters."::
53579::$$$message_0464_0008_0000$$$::"You're right.[lr]::
53580::$$$message_0464_0008_0001$$$::This Holy Grail War is so sketchy. I think it's different from what my father told me. It's like...something else is going on behind the scenes."::
53581::$$$message_0464_0009_0000$$$::Something else, huh...?[lr]::
53582::$$$message_0464_0009_0001$$$::For me, I'm an outsider to this whole business, so I haven't even had the luxury of considering that.[lr]::
53583::$$$message_0464_0009_0002$$$::But if a bona fide Master like Tohsaka thinks so, then something must be wrong.::
53584::$$$message_0464_0010_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, then..."[lr]::
53585::$$$message_0464_0010_0001$$$::"I won't follow the rules of the Holy Grail War until I'm satisfied with how it's run. I can't stop someone else from taking advantage of it, but I won't stand for being used by someone else, not knowing what harm I could be doing to others.[lr]::
53586::$$$message_0464_0010_0002$$$::You wouldn't like that either, would you? That's why I'm going to put a pause on fighting the other Masters until this is settled."::
53587::$$$message_0464_0011_0000$$$::She states it resolutely.[lr]::
53588::$$$message_0464_0011_0001$$$::Tohsaka's eyes are unwavering. At the same time, they seem to ask me for my decision.::
53589::$$$message_0464_0012_0000$$$::"All right. Then can I take that as a truce offer?"[lr]::
53590::$$$message_0464_0012_0001$$$::"That's up to you. If you agree to pause hostilities until this matter is settled, then I won't hurt you either."::
53591::$$$message_0464_0013_0000$$$::She fixes me with a questioning gaze.[lr]::
53592::$$$message_0464_0013_0001$$$::My answer, of course, was set from the beginning.::
53593::$$$message_0464_0014_0000$$$::"That's my line. I won't fight you as long as you don't come after me.[lr]::
53594::$$$message_0464_0014_0001$$$::And if we do fight, it'll be fair and square. Until then..."[lr]::
53595::$$$message_0464_0014_0002$$$::...I've always wanted to have a cooperative relationship with Tohsaka.::
53596::$$$message_0464_0015_0000$$$::"It's settled, then. I knew you'd say that, but it's nice to hear it out loud."[lr]::
53597::$$$message_0464_0015_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
53598::$$$message_0464_0015_0002$$$::Tohsaka extends her right hand.[lr]::
53599::$$$message_0464_0015_0003$$$::I realize she's waiting for me to shake it.[lr]::
53600::$$$message_0464_0015_0004$$$::"O-oh. Yeah, it's a deal."[lr]::
53601::$$$message_0464_0015_0005$$$::I try to ignore my suddenly reddening cheeks and stick out my right hand.::
53602::$$$message_0464_0016_0000$$$::"We have a deal. It'll be short, but I'm looking forward to it, Emiya."::
53603::$$$message_0464_0017_0000$$$::Tohsaka firmly shakes my hand.[lr]::
53604::$$$message_0464_0017_0001$$$::Her hand is far more delicate than mine. Her touch is soft, and slightly cool.[lr]::
53605::$$$message_0464_0017_0002$$$::"...!"[lr]::
53606::$$$message_0464_0017_0003$$$::W-what the hell am I thinking at a time like this!? Get a grip, Shirou!!!::
53607::$$$message_0464_0018_0000$$$::"? What's the matter, Emiya? You're suddenly sweating...and your heart rate is up."[lr]::
53608::$$$message_0464_0018_0001$$$::"!? I-it's nothing. Just a cold. I'll get better once I eat! So let's have lunch!"::
53609::$$$message_0464_0019_0000$$$::I tear my hand away from hers.[lr]::
53610::$$$message_0464_0019_0001$$$::Unfortunately...[lr]::
53611::$$$message_0464_0019_0002$$$::That only serves to twist Tohsaka's face into a devilish smile.::
53612::$$$message_0464_0020_0000$$$::"Ah-ha. I was wondering the last time we talked, but now I see. You look like you're used to talking to girls, but you're really not, are you?[lr]::
53613::$$$message_0464_0020_0001$$$::I'm not sure if I should be surprised or not, since it totally suits you.[lr]::
53614::$$$message_0464_0020_0002$$$::Hmm...hmm. Hmmm?"::
53615::$$$message_0464_0021_0000$$$::Smirking, Tohsaka appraises me from head to toe.::
53616::$$$message_0464_0022_0000$$$::"W-what? If you got something to say, say it. You shouldn't dangle it over me like that."[lr]::
53617::$$$message_0464_0022_0001$$$::"Oh, it's no big deal. I just feel like I understand you a little better now. Don't be scared[line2]I won't tell anyone."::
53618::$$$message_0464_0023_0000$$$::"I'm not scared! If you wanna tell everyone, then go ahead!"[lr]::
53619::$$$message_0464_0023_0001$$$::"Oh, may I?"[lr]::
53620::$$$message_0464_0023_0002$$$::She snickers.[lr]::
53621::$$$message_0464_0023_0003$$$::Ah... How can such an evil smile exist?::
53622::$$$message_0464_0024_0000$$$::"...Don't."[lr]::
53623::$$$message_0464_0024_0001$$$::"What? I didn't quite catch that."::
53624::$$$message_0464_0025_0000$$$::"...Sorry. Don't tell anyone. I think I'll go into shock if you do. Especially coming from you, it'll be two or three times worse."::
53625::$$$message_0464_0026_0000$$$::"Oh. Then maybe I won't."[lr]::
53626::$$$message_0464_0026_0001$$$::Tohsaka smiles triumphantly.[lr]::
53627::$$$message_0464_0026_0002$$$::I take a second to recover my composure.[lr]::
53628::$$$message_0464_0026_0003$$$::"Emiya, I bet you're one of those boys who stares at the recorder your crush plays."[lr]::
53629::$$$message_0464_0026_0004$$$::"You said you weren't going to say anything, you demon!!!"::
