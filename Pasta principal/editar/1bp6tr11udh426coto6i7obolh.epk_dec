31013::$$$message_0247_0000_0000$$$::"Hm, I guess Tohsaka knows a lot of people."[lr]::
31014::$$$message_0247_0000_0001$$$::I don't know who she's waiting for, but I probably shouldn't disturb her.[lr]::
31015::$$$message_0247_0000_0002$$$::First of all, if I'm seen talking with 2-A's idol, I'll be singled out by all the guys in class. Especially Gotou.::
31016::$$$message_0247_0001_0000$$$::"And it's lunchtime. I need sustenance if I'm gonna keep going."[lr]::
31017::$$$message_0247_0001_0001$$$::I take lunch out of my desk.[lr]::
31018::$$$message_0247_0001_0002$$$::The hit-and-run squad who come to mooch off my lunch seem to be busy watching Tohsaka, so I should be able to eat my lunch in peace today.::
31019::$$$message_0247_0002_0000$$$::"Huh? Tohsaka went back to her class."[lr]::
31020::$$$message_0247_0002_0001$$$::"Oh, so we'll never know why she was here.[lr]::
31021::$$$message_0247_0002_0002$$$::...Well, she might've just been taking a walk. Tohsaka seems to do some crazy things every now and then, right? Have you heard about how she almost tried to jump off the rooftop even though she's the one who dumped a third year?"::
31022::$$$message_0247_0003_0000$$$::"You've got it backwards. It was the third year that was gonna jump. She said she'd go out with him if he jumped the fence and stood at the edge of the rooftop for a day together. That third year didn't come to school for a while after that.[lr]::
31023::$$$message_0247_0003_0001$$$::...But why would she do something like that?[lr]::
31024::$$$message_0247_0003_0002$$$::Tohsaka's the type to just say no to something she doesn't want."::
31025::$$$message_0247_0004_0000$$$::"Oh, you speak of that? Tohsaka said something about a suspension bridge. As she didn't think she could fall in love with him, she thought that maybe she might develop romantic feelings if they spent a day in a tense situation together. Something that we the unworthy would never consider, that it is."::
31026::$$$message_0247_0005_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
31027::$$$message_0247_0005_0001$$$::I pause as I open my lunch.[lr]::
31028::$$$message_0247_0005_0002$$$::...I didn't know Tohsaka had such a legend... All right, I need to be careful when I go to the rooftop with her from now on.::
31029::$$$message_0247_0006_0000$$$::"Oh? Yes, Tohsaka's back!"[lr]::
31030::$$$message_0247_0006_0001$$$::"...Don't you think something's different? She was ready to kill before, but now she's so calm that I feel chills."[lr]::
31031::$$$message_0247_0006_0002$$$::"That is the smile of an angel, it is. It is the look of determination that says, 'If that's how you're going to be, then I'm not going to hold back either!'"::
31032::$$$message_0247_0007_0000$$$::"...Hm?"[lr]::
31033::$$$message_0247_0007_0001$$$::I feel a terrible chill.[lr]::
31034::$$$message_0247_0007_0002$$$::Saber's training seems to be paying dividends, as my danger sense is sharper.::
31035::$$$message_0247_0008_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
31036::$$$message_0247_0008_0001$$$::I peek into the hallway.[lr]::
31037::$$$message_0247_0008_0002$$$::There is Tohsaka, smiling, holding an eraser she must've got from her class.[lr]::
31038::$$$message_0247_0008_0003$$$::In an instant...::
31039::$$$message_0247_0009_0000$$$::Said eraser smashes directly into my forehead.::
31040::$$$message_0247_0009_0001$$$::"What!? Emiya suddenly flipped over...!?"[lr]::
31041::$$$message_0247_0009_0002$$$::"No way! What happened, Emiya? Did you install a motor in your chair!?"[lr]::
31042::$$$message_0247_0009_0003$$$::"Is that a ninja move!? Is it, Emiya!?"::
31043::$$$message_0247_0009_0004$$$::"Ah... Ouch..."[lr]::
31044::$$$message_0247_0009_0005$$$::Gotou and the others make a commotion over it.[lr]::
31045::$$$message_0247_0009_0006$$$::I've fallen, chair and all. The others surround me and offer help, though they look at me with anxious, no, excited eyes.::
31046::$$$message_0247_0009_0007$$$::"Oof, thanks... Wait, what did it look like to you, Gotou?"[lr]::
31047::$$$message_0247_0009_0008$$$::"Hm? You just did something like a flip. Like you performed a cartwheel while still sitting in your chair."[lr]::
31048::$$$message_0247_0009_0009$$$::Gotou requests that I teach him how to do it.[lr]::
31049::$$$message_0247_0009_0010$$$::Well, there's no doubt that he'll get a good laugh if he can do a flip on command the moment a teacher calls on him, so I can see why he's jealous.[lr]::
31050::$$$message_0247_0009_0011$$$::But, that's neither here nor there.::
31051::$$$message_0247_0010_0000$$$::My real problem is the devil in the hall that threw that bullet, toting a second and deciding how she'll deliver the blow a second time around.::
31052::$$$message_0247_0011_0000$$$::"Sorry, Gotou. We'll talk later. I have something that I have to do."[lr]::
31053::$$$message_0247_0011_0001$$$::The desk was left unharmed, so I grab my lunch and get up from my seat.[lr]::
31054::$$$message_0247_0011_0002$$$::...It hurts.[lr]::
31055::$$$message_0247_0011_0003$$$::My forehead where the eraser hit stings more than the hip I landed on, dammit.::
31056::$$$message_0247_0012_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, you...!"[lr]::
31057::$$$message_0247_0012_0001$$$::I lash out at the magic bullet shooter while holding my red forehead.::
31058::$$$message_0247_0013_0000$$$::"Heh, it's your fault for standing there so absent-mindedly.[lr]::
31059::$$$message_0247_0013_0001$$$::It's fine to eat lunch in peace, but you're in no position to do so, right?"::
31060::$$$message_0247_0014_0000$$$::"Mrgh... But with enough force to flip someone... I would've died if I was unlucky."[lr]::
31061::$$$message_0247_0014_0001$$$::"I'm not sure about that. You don't seem to die so easily.[lr]::
31062::$$$message_0247_0014_0002$$$::...Well, I don't care about that. We need to talk, so follow me."::
31063::$$$message_0247_0015_0000$$$::"Talk as in... You mean a strategy meeting?"[lr]::
31064::$$$message_0247_0015_0001$$$::"Of course. Come on, hurry. We don't have much time now since you were taking your time. Lunch break is going to end."::
31065::$$$message_0247_0016_0000$$$::She looks away awkwardly and starts walking.[lr]::
31066::$$$message_0247_0016_0001$$$::Is it...[lr]::
31067::$$$message_0247_0016_0002$$$::Is it my imagination or...[lr]::
31068::$$$message_0247_0016_0003$$$::Does it look like Tohsaka isn't doing so well?::
31069::$$$message_0247_0017_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
31070::$$$message_0247_0017_0001$$$::She brings me to the empty rooftop.::
