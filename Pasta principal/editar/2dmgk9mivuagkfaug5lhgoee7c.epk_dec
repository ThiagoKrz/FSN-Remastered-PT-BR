3097::$$$message_0032_0000_0000$$$::   I'll just take the long way home.[lr]::
3098::$$$message_0032_0000_0001$$$::It's just about a five minute detour.[lr]::
3099::$$$message_0032_0000_0002$$$::I'm being whimsical here, and I don't need to make excuses about that.::
3100::$$$message_0032_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
3101::$$$message_0032_0001_0001$$$::I park my bicycle.[lr]::
3102::$$$message_0032_0001_0002$$$::I step into the park, my groceries still on my bike.::
3103::$$$message_0032_0002_0000$$$::"Why..."[lr]::
3104::$$$message_0032_0002_0001$$$::...am I doing this in the first place?[lr]::
3105::$$$message_0032_0002_0002$$$::It's just so impulsive of me.[lr]::
3106::$$$message_0032_0002_0003$$$::I just had the passing thought that it would be nice to see her.[lr]::
3107::$$$message_0032_0002_0004$$$::And then I see a silver-haired girl standing off on her own.::
3108::$$$message_0032_0003_0000$$$::She doesn't seem to have noticed me.[lr]::
3109::$$$message_0032_0003_0001$$$::If I wanted, I could just leave.[lr]::
3110::$$$message_0032_0003_0002$$$::But if I were going to do that, I wouldn't have come here in the first place.::
3111::$$$message_0032_0004_0000$$$::"Illya."::
3112::$$$message_0032_0005_0000$$$::"...Who's there!?"[lr]::
3113::$$$message_0032_0005_0001$$$::"Uh, it's just me, Shirou."[lr]::
3114::$$$message_0032_0005_0002$$$::"Eh...? Shirou? Is that really you?"::
3115::$$$message_0032_0006_0000$$$::"Is that really such a surprise?"[lr]::
3116::$$$message_0032_0006_0001$$$::This park's close to the shopping district, so me passing by here isn't all that strange. I'm honestly more curious why you're here again. Do you have [font italic=true]that[font italic=false] much free time?"::
3117::$$$message_0032_0007_0000$$$::"Yep. You're exactly right. I don't really have anything else to do, so I came here to play, but Sella said I shouldn't see you. She said it'd be no fun to play with you because I'm going to kill you soon anyway."::
3118::$$$message_0032_0008_0000$$$::"Uh...well, that..."[lr]::
3119::$$$message_0032_0008_0001$$$::Whoa.[lr]::
3120::$$$message_0032_0008_0002$$$::That makes it pretty hard to come up with a response.::
3121::$$$message_0032_0009_0000$$$::"But I don't think that's true, because being with you's fun, so I've been waiting here all this time, thinking I might meet you again.[lr]::
3122::$$$message_0032_0009_0001$$$::So, I'm glad you came, Shirou."::
3123::$$$message_0032_0010_0000$$$::"...Wait a minute. Don't tell me you were waiting for me this whole time!?"[lr]::
3124::$$$message_0032_0010_0001$$$::"Yep.[lr]::
3125::$$$message_0032_0010_0002$$$::It's been a real long time. I was thinking how nice it'd be if you came here."::
3126::$$$message_0032_0011_0000$$$::"You dummy. I thought you didn't like the cold. If you want to see me, you should've come to my place[line2]okay, maybe not. If you met Saber, that'd definitely lead to a fight.[lr]::
3127::$$$message_0032_0011_0001$$$::But still, there are plenty of other places you could have found me. You had no trouble finding me at the shopping district yesterday."::
3128::$$$message_0032_0012_0000$$$::"No, I can't do that. I can't go and find you myself. I just broke the rules yesterday, just that once.[lr]::
3129::$$$message_0032_0012_0001$$$::So I decided to wait at a place I thought you might come, and I was right!"::
3130::$$$message_0032_0013_0000$$$::Illya skips around excitedly.[lr]::
3131::$$$message_0032_0013_0001$$$::Her bouncing silver hair makes her look like a winter fairy.::
3132::$$$message_0032_0014_0000$$$::"I got that. But why do you want to see me in the first place? If just talking to you like yesterday is enough, I'm happy to do it again."::
3133::$$$message_0032_0015_0000$$$::"Nope. I don't have anything in particular to talk about like yesterday. I just thought it would be nice to see you today. Besides, we're enemies. I'll come and kill you when the Holy Grail War is about to end, so we can talk then."::
3134::$$$message_0032_0016_0000$$$::She says it so innocently.[lr]::
3135::$$$message_0032_0016_0001$$$::The disconnect between her words and manner is hard to swallow.[lr]::
3136::$$$message_0032_0016_0002$$$::It's not that she's going to kill me so much as how unfitting it seems for her to be a Master.::
3137::$$$message_0032_0017_0000$$$::"Illya. Do you [font italic=true]want[font italic=false] to do that?[lr]::
3138::$$$message_0032_0017_0001$$$::Did you really choose to get involved in this Holy Grail War yourself?"::
3139::$$$message_0032_0018_0000$$$::"Hm? It's my grandfather's orders.[lr]::
3140::$$$message_0032_0018_0001$$$::I'm the best-suited to be a Master out of all the Einzberns, since I possess a really big Holy Grail."::
3141::$$$message_0032_0019_0000$$$::"...But that means you're doing it because your grandfather ordered you to. You didn't [font italic=true]choose[font italic=false] to be a Master."::
3142::$$$message_0032_0020_0000$$$::"Hmmm...maybe? I don't really remember, but I've been a Master since I was born. So it only makes sense for me to fight."[lr]::
3143::$$$message_0032_0020_0001$$$::"That's wrong. If you're just fighting because someone told you to, you should stop.[lr]::
3144::$$$message_0032_0020_0002$$$::First of all, killing doesn't suit you."::
3145::$$$message_0032_0022_0000$$$::"Oh? It doesn't sound like you're pleading for your life.[lr]::
3146::$$$message_0032_0022_0001$$$::You actually sound really worried about me, big brother."::
3147::$$$message_0032_0023_0000$$$::"Of course I am. I don't know what anyone else thinks, but I hate the idea of someone like you fighting. If it were up to me, I'd rather see you quit being a Master and go live a quiet life."::
3148::$$$message_0032_0024_0000$$$::"Teehee. I may consider it if you become my Servant. If you did that, I wouldn't have to kill you."::
3149::$$$message_0032_0025_0000$$$::"Wha...wh-wh-what the hell are you talking about!? Do you really know what it means to ask me to be your Servant!?"[lr]::
3150::$$$message_0032_0025_0001$$$::Besides, there's no way I could be a substitute for Berserker...!::
3151::$$$message_0032_0026_0000$$$::"I'm saying that you should stop fighting. I'm telling you to give up your Servant, so why would you need me to be your familiar?"::
3152::$$$message_0032_0027_0000$$$::"Not a familiar. A Servant.[lr]::
3153::$$$message_0032_0027_0001$$$::Servants are always with you, right? That's why I just need you to be by my side.::
3154::$$$message_0032_0028_0000$$$::"Hm...mmm?"[lr]::
3155::$$$message_0032_0028_0001$$$::...Hold on a minute.[lr]::
3156::$$$message_0032_0028_0002$$$::Don't tell me. Does Illya think...::
3157::$$$message_0032_0029_0000$$$::"Let me ask you something. What is a Servant, Illya?"[lr]::
3158::$$$message_0032_0029_0001$$$::"They're mine, right? They're always by my side, and they protect me. That's what Grandfather told me."[lr]::
3159::$$$message_0032_0029_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
3160::$$$message_0032_0030_0000$$$::I knew it.[lr]::
3161::$$$message_0032_0030_0001$$$::Illya considers Servants to be just that.[lr]::
3162::$$$message_0032_0030_0002$$$::Command Spells, Masters, none of that matters.[lr]::
3163::$$$message_0032_0030_0003$$$::To her, a Servant is just something that protects her.::
3164::$$$message_0032_0031_0000$$$::"Got it. But no, I still can't. I can't agree to that, so think of something else."[lr]::
3165::$$$message_0032_0031_0001$$$::"Wh-what?[lr]::
3166::$$$message_0032_0031_0002$$$::I'm not good enough for you?"::
3167::$$$message_0032_0032_0000$$$::"Uh, well, it's not about being good enough...um, it's just that..."[lr]::
3168::$$$message_0032_0032_0001$$$::I'm worried about Illya, but I know I can't be by her side twenty-four seven, either.::
3169::$$$message_0032_0033_0000$$$::"Illya, I have Saber.[lr]::
3170::$$$message_0032_0033_0001$$$::And as a Master, I need to stop other Masters. So, I'm sorry, but I can't be your Servant."::
3171::$$$message_0032_0034_0000$$$::"What!? I made a concession because I was talking to you! You're going to pay for it!"[lr]::
3172::$$$message_0032_0034_0001$$$::"Hey wait...hold on, Illya! We haven't finis[line2]"::
3173::$$$message_0032_0035_0000$$$::"Stupid Shirou! You're the worst for embarrassing a girl!!!"[lr]::
3174::$$$message_0032_0035_0001$$$::"Uh...there she goes..."[lr]::
3175::$$$message_0032_0035_0002$$$::Illya just runs out of the park, not listening to me anymore.::
3176::$$$message_0032_0036_0000$$$::I try to follow her, but I can't find her.[lr]::
3177::$$$message_0032_0036_0001$$$::"...Crap. This is just like yesterday."[lr]::
3178::$$$message_0032_0036_0002$$$::I sigh and go back to my bike.::
3179::$$$message_0032_0037_0000$$$::But...I don't think she'll just suddenly attack again like when we first met that night.[lr]::
3180::$$$message_0032_0037_0001$$$::So I should probably have one more chance to convince her.::%H
