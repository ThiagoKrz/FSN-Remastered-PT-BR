75871::$$$message_0701_0000_0000$$$::"...Um, Illya, I guess?"[lr]::
75872::$$$message_0701_0000_0001$$$::I just say the first name that comes to mind.::
75873::$$$message_0701_0001_0000$$$::"Yeah! You're one lucky duck, Shirou!"[lr]::
75874::$$$message_0701_0001_0001$$$::Illya hugs me tightly.[lr]::
75875::$$$message_0701_0001_0002$$$::As an older brother figure, I'm more than happy about that,::
75876::$$$message_0701_0002_0000$$$::but Tohsaka doesn't look amused in the slightest. It's enough to cancel out the joy, no, put me in the negative, actually.::
75877::$$$message_0701_0003_0000$$$::"...Hmph. You like making children happy, huh? You're pretty childish yourself, Emiya. Don't tell me you're into little girls?"[lr]::
75878::$$$message_0701_0003_0001$$$::Aaargh... To make matters worse, she's back to calling me "Emiya."[lr]::
75879::$$$message_0701_0003_0002$$$::She's giving me a wince-inducing look reserved for the utter dregs of society.::
75880::$$$message_0701_0004_0000$$$::Heh, you're embarrassing yourself, Rin. It isn't very ladylike to lose your temper just because you got dumped. That's why Shirou doesn't like you.[lr]::
75881::$$$message_0701_0004_0001$$$::"Ngh...! Y-you don't know what you're talking about, you precocious little brat![lr]::
75882::$$$message_0701_0004_0002$$$::I'm just stating normal social values, and first of all, who are you calling dumped...!?"::
75883::$$$message_0701_0005_0000$$$::Tohsaka roars like a tiger.[lr]::
75884::$$$message_0701_0005_0001$$$::Illya giggles and hugs me tighter.::
75885::$$$message_0701_0006_0000$$$::"See, Shirou? Rin's so scary.[lr]::
75886::$$$message_0701_0006_0001$$$::But don't worry. I'll protect you, no matter what she tries!"::
75887::$$$message_0701_0007_0000$$$::Illya beams.[lr]::
75888::$$$message_0701_0007_0001$$$::I'm happy to see that.[lr]::
75889::$$$message_0701_0007_0002$$$::Twice as happy as I was a moment ago, actually.[lr]::
75890::$$$message_0701_0007_0003$$$::...But now I'm getting a look so cold and judgmental I can't possibly defend myself against it, so can we move on?::
75891::$$$message_0701_0008_0000$$$::"What? If you've got something to say, say it."[lr]::
75892::$$$message_0701_0008_0001$$$::"Oh, it's nothing. Your tastes have nothing to do with me, Emiya. I have criticisms, but I won't voice them.[lr]::
75893::$$$message_0701_0008_0002$$$::...But seriously, why?"[lr]::
75894::$$$message_0701_0008_0003$$$::She asks me bluntly.[lr]::
75895::$$$message_0701_0008_0004$$$::However...::
75896::$$$message_0701_0009_0000$$$::"Um. What do you mean, why?"[lr]::
75897::$$$message_0701_0009_0001$$$::Even I'm not really sure why I chose Illya. It's like it happened on instinct.::
75898::$$$message_0701_0010_0000$$$::"...I can't believe this. Are you seriously one of [font italic=true]those[font italic=false] people?"[lr]::
75899::$$$message_0701_0010_0001$$$::"L-like hell I am, idiot! I just picked her because I felt like it. I'm basically Illya's guardian now anyway, so it only makes sense I'd choose her...!"::
75900::$$$message_0701_0011_0000$$$::Aargh. The man doth protest too much, methinks.[lr]::
75901::$$$message_0701_0011_0001$$$::"Yeah! Shirou's my Servant now!"[lr]::
75902::$$$message_0701_0011_0002$$$::Tohsaka looks exasperated, while Illya is jumping for joy.::
75903::$$$message_0701_0012_0000$$$::"...Looks like you've got your fighting spirit back. If you're going to insist on it that hard, I'll respect your choice, but I feel bad for Sakura."[lr]::
75904::$$$message_0701_0012_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75905::$$$message_0701_0012_0002$$$::I'm curious.[lr]::
75906::$$$message_0701_0012_0003$$$::I'm extremely curious what "choice" Tohsaka thinks I'm making.::
75907::$$$message_0701_0013_0000$$$::"But don't forget. Even if you don't use it, that arm belongs to me.[lr]::
75908::$$$message_0701_0013_0001$$$::...You have an obligation to serve me in Archer's place.[lr]::
75909::$$$message_0701_0013_0002$$$::Your body doesn't belong only to you anymore."::
75910::$$$message_0701_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75911::$$$message_0701_0014_0001$$$::She's right.[lr]::
75912::$$$message_0701_0014_0002$$$::Tohsaka lost Archer, and Archer's arm saved my life.[lr]::
75913::$$$message_0701_0014_0003$$$::...That means I have to help her in his stead.::
75914::$$$message_0701_0015_0000$$$::"...Yeah, I know. Setting aside the fact that you keep calling me a Servant, I'll let you decide our next steps.[lr]::
75915::$$$message_0701_0015_0001$$$::I'm out of ideas at this point, so any knowledge you can spare would give me a surer idea of what to do."::
75916::$$$message_0701_0016_0000$$$::"That's right. I'll do the thinking, while you do the work. We're in the same boat now, so I'll be working you hard."::
75917::$$$message_0701_0017_0000$$$::That's right.[lr]::
75918::$$$message_0701_0017_0001$$$::No matter what our history is, I have a new left arm thanks to Archer.[lr]::
75919::$$$message_0701_0017_0002$$$::If he passed on while he still had his pact with Tohsaka, then it isn't wrong of me to inherit the promise he couldn't keep to her.::
