66246::$$$message_0613_0000_0000$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
66247::$$$message_0613_0000_0001$$$::A shrill noise comes from the kitchen.[lr]::
66248::$$$message_0613_0000_0002$$$::It's the fourth time tonight I've heard that unpleasant sound.::
66249::$$$message_0613_0001_0000$$$::"I-I'm sorry! I'm okay, don't worry...!"[lr]::
66250::$$$message_0613_0001_0001$$$::I hear Sakura's voice from the kitchen.[lr]::
66251::$$$message_0613_0001_0002$$$::...Tohsaka just frowns. She seems tired of warning Sakura by now.::
66252::$$$message_0613_0002_0000$$$::It's shortly before 6 o'clock.[lr]::
66253::$$$message_0613_0002_0001$$$::Sakura asked us to let her make dinner to close out the day.[lr]::
66254::$$$message_0613_0002_0002$$$::She chased me and Tohsaka out of the kitchen, so we've just been waiting around for her to finish making dinner.::
66255::$$$message_0613_0003_0000$$$::"Ah...!"[lr]::
66256::$$$message_0613_0003_0001$$$::...Another plate or bowl breaks.[lr]::
66257::$$$message_0613_0003_0002$$$::It's the sound of Sakura's failure that we've gotten used to hearing for the last half of today.::
66258::$$$message_0613_0004_0000$$$::...Let's rewind to noon.[lr]::
66259::$$$message_0613_0004_0001$$$::Sakura couldn't make stew after Illya and I went out for groceries.[lr]::
66260::$$$message_0613_0004_0002$$$::She was waiting for us when we got home, but she clearly wasn't feeling well.::
66261::$$$message_0613_0005_0000$$$::"I'm okay. I feel a little feverish, but I can make lunch, at least."::
66262::$$$message_0613_0006_0000$$$::And it's true, she could have cooked us lunch.[lr]::
66263::$$$message_0613_0006_0001$$$::But we weren't going to make her push herself when she was clearly suffering from a fever.[lr]::
66264::$$$message_0613_0006_0002$$$::By the time Tohsaka and I convinced Sakura to take a nap, it was already past two in the afternoon.::
66265::$$$message_0613_0007_0000$$$::Before she did, she insisted,[lr]::
66266::$$$message_0613_0007_0001$$$::"But once my fever is down, you'll let me be in the kitchen, right?"[lr]::
66267::$$$message_0613_0007_0002$$$::and went off to bed.::
66268::$$$message_0613_0008_0000$$$::Then came evening.[lr]::
66269::$$$message_0613_0008_0001$$$::I'm not sure when my training ended, but when I finished and went back to the living room, Sakura was already starting to cook dinner.::
66270::$$$message_0613_0009_0000$$$::"Oh, I hope your training went well, Senpai. Just hold on, I'll have dinner ready for you soon."[lr]::
66271::$$$message_0613_0009_0001$$$::And then she cheerfully went back to her cooking.[lr]::
66272::$$$message_0613_0009_0002$$$::I could tell with a single glance that she was putting on a strong front.::
66273::$$$message_0613_0010_0000$$$::"You're tired, so go rest."[r]::
66274::$$$message_0613_0010_0001$$$::I said that Tohsaka and I would make dinner, but Sakura refused to back down.::
66275::$$$message_0613_0011_0000$$$::"Oh, you don't need to be so overprotective. I'm a Master, too. This is nothing compared to actually fighting."::
66276::$$$message_0613_0012_0000$$$::She stubbornly refused to back down, no matter what we said.[lr]::
66277::$$$message_0613_0012_0001$$$::On top of that, she refused to let us help, especially Tohsaka.::
66278::$$$message_0613_0013_0000$$$::Tohsaka reacted with more surprise than I expected.::
66279::$$$message_0613_0014_0000$$$::"I mean... you're training Senpai, right? I need to make myself useful, too.[lr]::
66280::$$$message_0613_0014_0001$$$::I want to help like you, Nee-san. [lr]::
66281::$$$message_0613_0014_0002$$$::...Besides, this is a role I've always had. I'd like to keep doing it as long as I can."::
66282::$$$message_0613_0015_0000$$$::...It sounds like this is something that Sakura just can't give up.[lr]::
66283::$$$message_0613_0015_0001$$$::I can only imagine how defeating it must feel to stop doing something she's done routinely every single day, no matter how hard it is to move her body.::
66284::$$$message_0613_0016_0000$$$::"Fine. Take care of dinner, Sakura."[r]::
66285::$$$message_0613_0016_0001$$$::Tohsaka got irritated, and started to criticize me,[lr]::
66286::$$$message_0613_0016_0002$$$::but that only made Sakura say,[lr]::
66287::$$$message_0613_0016_0003$$$::"Yes! I'll do my best, Senpai!"[lr]::
66288::$$$message_0613_0016_0004$$$::It was hard to be negative in front of that much enthusiasm.::
66289::$$$message_0613_0017_0000$$$::"Thank you for your patience!"[lr]::
66290::$$$message_0613_0017_0001$$$::Her bright voice reaches the dining table.[lr]::
66291::$$$message_0613_0017_0002$$$::Sakura confidently sets plate after plate on the table.::
66292::$$$message_0613_0018_0000$$$::"Oh, takikomi gohan. You put a lot of work into this, Sakura."[lr]::
66293::$$$message_0613_0018_0001$$$::"Yes. You bought good clams and shrimp, so I used them to make tonight's dinner.[lr]::
66294::$$$message_0613_0018_0002$$$::I cooked the clams into the rice, steamed the shrimp in dumplings, did the squid in a more ethnic style, and topped it off with a Hamburg steak just for Illya!"::
66295::$$$message_0613_0019_0000$$$::She puffs up her chest proudly.[lr]::
66296::$$$message_0613_0019_0001$$$::The dishes she's laid out on the table do show brilliance unlike anything she's made so far, so she must have put her heart into making them.[lr]::
66297::$$$message_0613_0019_0002$$$::The secret ingredient is effort.::
66298::$$$message_0613_0020_0000$$$::"Oooohhh..."[lr]::
66299::$$$message_0613_0020_0001$$$::Clap, clap, clap, clap.[lr]::
66300::$$$message_0613_0020_0002$$$::We other three diners applaud the display.::
66301::$$$message_0613_0021_0000$$$::"I was worried about you for a while there, but this looks worth the wait. I'm excited to try it."[lr]::
66302::$$$message_0613_0021_0001$$$::"I'm going to eat a lot, too. Hand me that fork, Shirou."[lr]::
66303::$$$message_0613_0021_0002$$$::"Here ya go. Don't mind if take some myself..."[lr]::
66304::$$$message_0613_0021_0003$$$::"Yes! I made enough for seconds, so be sure to eat a lot!"::
66305::$$$message_0613_0022_0000$$$::I make a quiet bow and pick up a steamed dumpling with my chopsticks.[lr]::
66306::$$$message_0613_0022_0001$$$::At a glance, the round, bite-sized dumplings resemble siu mai.[lr]::
66307::$$$message_0613_0022_0002$$$::They're beautifully formed, and accompanied by an exquisite balance of spring onions, ginger, and daikon sprouts.[lr]::
66308::$$$message_0613_0022_0003$$$::I was uneasy letting Sakura cook for four people, but I can't complain now that[line2]::
66309::$$$message_0613_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66310::$$$message_0613_0023_0001$$$::My chopsticks stop moving.[lr]::
66311::$$$message_0613_0023_0002$$$::All three of our expressions must have frozen for an instant.::
66312::$$$message_0613_0024_0000$$$::We pretend not to notice, and quietly keep eating.[lr]::
66313::$$$message_0613_0024_0001$$$::...We have to keep eating.[lr]::
66314::$$$message_0613_0024_0002$$$::The colorful dishes taste inconsistent.[lr]::
66315::$$$message_0613_0024_0003$$$::They don't taste bad, per se.[lr]::
66316::$$$message_0613_0024_0004$$$::They just each seem to lack a subtle flavor or taste off balance.::
66317::$$$message_0613_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66318::$$$message_0613_0025_0001$$$::The silence is uncomfortable.[lr]::
66319::$$$message_0613_0025_0002$$$::We keep quietly eating, not quite looking at each other.::
66320::$$$message_0613_0026_0000$$$::Still, it's impossible to play it off.[lr]::
66321::$$$message_0613_0026_0001$$$::Sakura cooked this.[lr]::
66322::$$$message_0613_0026_0002$$$::She'll realize it tastes wrong as soon as she eats it.[lr]::
66323::$$$message_0613_0026_0003$$$::Our silence is just a prelude to that discovery.::
66324::$$$message_0613_0027_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66325::$$$message_0613_0027_0001$$$::I look up at Sakura.[lr]::
66326::$$$message_0613_0027_0002$$$::...She should have realized it by now.[lr]::
66327::$$$message_0613_0027_0003$$$::Yeah, she's sitting there in shock...[lr]::
66328::$$$message_0613_0027_0004$$$::...and she hasn't taken a single bite.::
66329::$$$message_0613_0028_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
66330::$$$message_0613_0028_0001$$$::I try to watch her inconspicuously so that she doesn't notice.[lr]::
66331::$$$message_0613_0028_0002$$$::...I wonder what's wrong.[lr]::
66332::$$$message_0613_0028_0003$$$::Sakura is looking down at her rice bowl and chopsticks with a troubled expression.::
66333::$$$message_0613_0029_0000$$$::...She hesitates, then resolves herself to reach for her chopsticks.[lr]::
66334::$$$message_0613_0029_0001$$$::But then, she drops them with a clatter.[lr]::
66335::$$$message_0613_0029_0002$$$::She hastily picks them up again and tries to gloss over it by picking up her rice bowl, too.::
66336::$$$message_0613_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66337::$$$message_0613_0030_0001$$$::I...I can't directly watch her doing it.[lr]::
66338::$$$message_0613_0030_0002$$$::Sakura repeats the effort several times.[lr]::
66339::$$$message_0613_0030_0003$$$::She clumsily moves her fingers and warily picks up the food with her chopsticks,[lr]::
66340::$$$message_0613_0030_0004$$$::only to drop it each time and try again.[lr]::
66341::$$$message_0613_0030_0005$$$::...It's more than just difficulty controlling her fingers.[lr]::
66342::$$$message_0613_0030_0006$$$::Her awkward movements look like that of someone who knew how to use chopsticks until a few seconds ago, but forgot once she picked them up.::
66343::$$$message_0613_0031_0000$$$::"Uh...ah...um..."[lr]::
66344::$$$message_0613_0031_0001$$$::...We're not looking.[lr]::
66345::$$$message_0613_0031_0002$$$::It's a slip-up that anyone would notice right away, but we don't see it.[lr]::
66346::$$$message_0613_0031_0003$$$::I tell myself it's just dinner as usual, even as she fails over and over.::
66347::$$$message_0613_0032_0000$$$::...She awkwardly manipulates her chopsticks onto the food, finally manages to eat one bite, forgets how to hold the chopsticks, and has to remember all over again.[lr]::
66348::$$$message_0613_0032_0001$$$::I can't bring myself to interrupt her desperation and ask her if she's all right.::
66349::$$$message_0613_0033_0000$$$::Tohsaka hasn't noticed.[lr]::
66350::$$$message_0613_0033_0001$$$::She's pretending not to notice, and quietly eating her dinner.::
66351::$$$message_0613_0034_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66352::$$$message_0613_0034_0001$$$::So am I.[lr]::
66353::$$$message_0613_0034_0002$$$::We all pretend not to notice anything wrong with Sakura, and finish our meal in silence.::
66354::$$$message_0613_0035_0000$$$::I decided to clean up after dinner.[lr]::
66355::$$$message_0613_0035_0001$$$::Sakura tried to help, but I cruelly turned her away.[lr]::
66356::$$$message_0613_0035_0002$$$::It's obvious she can't help clean in her state, and...I don't want Sakura to have to confront another routine that she can't do anymore, as she mentioned earlier.::
66357::$$$message_0613_0036_0000$$$::"Just go back to your room and get a good night's sleep. Remember how your nap helped it go away during the day? It'll work this time, too."[lr]::
66358::$$$message_0613_0036_0001$$$::I basically tell her that if she lies down and keeps her body from moving, she'll be able to move her fingers again.[lr]::
66359::$$$message_0613_0036_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66360::$$$message_0613_0036_0003$$$::It doesn't make much sense, even to me.::
66361::$$$message_0613_0037_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
66362::$$$message_0613_0037_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
66363::$$$message_0613_0037_0002$$$::Sakura bites her lip in anguish, looking away.::
66364::$$$message_0613_0038_0000$$$::"Sakura. This isn't going to last forever. But if you push yourself when you aren't feeling well, it'll take longer to get better.[lr]::
66365::$$$message_0613_0038_0001$$$::You didn't do anything wrong. Just let us spoil you for a while."::
66366::$$$message_0613_0039_0000$$$::"Th-that's not true! I'm doing everything wrong![lr]::
66367::$$$message_0613_0039_0001$$$::My fever is down, and I remember what happened yesterday. I could tell from your face earlier, too! I've never done anything to make you worry before, so when I see you feeling that way, I have to..."::
66368::$$$message_0613_0040_0000$$$::"...Make it so that I don't worry? Don't be silly. I'll tell you exactly how bad you're pushing yourself."::
66369::$$$message_0613_0041_0000$$$::"It took you two hours to make dinner. You accidentally dropped a plate seven times. On top of that, you messed up all the seasoning.[lr]::
66370::$$$message_0613_0041_0001$$$::You weren't careful with the salt and you added way too much pepper. It didn't even taste like your cooking. It's fine to be proud of your work, but it has the opposite effect when you don't show results."::
66371::$$$message_0613_0042_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66372::$$$message_0613_0042_0001$$$::"Do you understand me now? I know you want to get better, but you still have a fever. Otherwise, you wouldn't have made all those mistakes.[lr]::
66373::$$$message_0613_0042_0002$$$::...Just so you know, I'm mad. I'm not letting you back into the kitchen tomorrow. I won't let you push yourself again until you completely recover, so behave yourself and sleep."::
66374::$$$message_0613_0043_0000$$$::I don't wait for her to answer and lead her by the hand to her bedroom.[lr]::
66375::$$$message_0613_0043_0001$$$::Her footsteps are heavy, but I ignored them and took her to her room.::
