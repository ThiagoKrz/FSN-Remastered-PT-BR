41136::$$$message_0358_0000_0001$$$::...We have to accept his offer.[lr]::
41137::$$$message_0358_0000_0002$$$::Even if he is an enemy, his argument is correct.[lr]::
41138::$$$message_0358_0000_0003$$$::Tohsaka and I alone can't beat Caster.[lr]::
41139::$$$message_0358_0000_0004$$$::But there should be some hope if we have Lancer's help.[lr]::
41140::$$$message_0358_0000_0005$$$::However...::
41141::$$$message_0358_0001_0000$$$::"...All right. I'll believe your argument.[lr]::
41142::$$$message_0358_0001_0001$$$::But under one condition. I'll accept your help in defeating Caster, and we'll trust you.[lr]::
41143::$$$message_0358_0001_0002$$$::But..."::
41144::$$$message_0358_0002_0000$$$::"But what? You want me to tell you who my Master is?"[lr]::
41145::$$$message_0358_0002_0001$$$::"No. Even if we're cooperating, stay away from Tohsaka."::
41146::$$$message_0358_0003_0000$$$::   The air freezes.[lr]::
41147::$$$message_0358_0003_0001$$$::Lancer becomes speechless as if he was completely caught off guard.::
41148::$$$message_0358_0004_0000$$$::"Hah, I see, I see! Of course, that's way more important than my Master right, kid!?"[lr]::
41149::$$$message_0358_0004_0001$$$::He starts laughing as if it's the funniest thing he's heard.::
41150::$$$message_0358_0005_0000$$$:: "What, is that bad? Just letting you know, but I won't let you have Tohsaka."[lr]::
41151::$$$message_0358_0005_0001$$$::"Of course not. It's not bad. In fact, I see you in a whole new light.[lr]::
41152::$$$message_0358_0005_0002$$$::Wow, that's great, young lady. This kid is head over heels over you!"::
41153::$$$message_0358_0006_0000$$$::"Guh! W-W-W-What are you saying, we're not like that! Um... Yes, we're just cooperating...!"[lr]::
41154::$$$message_0358_0006_0001$$$::"Are you sure about that?"::
41155::$$$message_0358_0007_0000$$$::"Guh...! You get on my nerves. What's with that know-it-all face...!?[lr]::
41156::$$$message_0358_0007_0001$$$::Come on, say something, Shirou. Tell him we're just cooperating!"::

41158::$$$message_0358_0008_0001$$$::...::
41159::$$$message_0358_0009_0000$$$::"Hey, say something, idiot...![lr]::
41160::$$$message_0358_0009_0001$$$::T-This is as if we, um, actually like each other..."::
41161::$$$message_0358_0010_0000$$$::"Hey, it's not 'as if.' You guys are already in love with each other. It's obvious even to me, though you're both covering it up. Man, she'll be quite a handful, boy."[lr]::
41162::$$$message_0358_0010_0001$$$::Lancer makes a sympathetic gesture.::
41163::$$$message_0358_0011_0000$$$::"...Well. I already know that Tohsaka is a handful."[lr]::
41164::$$$message_0358_0011_0001$$$::I reply with a sour look to let him know that there's no problem.::
41165::$$$message_0358_0012_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
41166::$$$message_0358_0012_0001$$$::"Oh, how dependable. Then I shall be mindful when I interact with her.[lr]::
41167::$$$message_0358_0012_0002$$$::But well, she's fun to tease, so I'll have fun on the way. You don't mind this much, right?"::
41168::$$$message_0358_0013_0000$$$::"...All right. Let's go with that. We'll get your help until we defeat Caster."[lr]::
41169::$$$message_0358_0013_0001$$$::"Then it's decided. Well, let's shake hands."::
41170::$$$message_0358_0014_0000$$$::Lancer comes up to me unarmed and shakes my right hand that I awkwardly put out.[lr]::
41171::$$$message_0358_0014_0001$$$::   There are worrying factors, but we were able to obtain a reliable ally.[lr]::
41172::$$$message_0358_0014_0002$$$::All that's left is...::
41173::$$$message_0358_0015_0000$$$::"Khh, I'm so mad!!![lr]::
41174::$$$message_0358_0015_0001$$$::Whatever, I'm calling it off with you guys. I'll go beat Caster by myself!!!"[lr]::
