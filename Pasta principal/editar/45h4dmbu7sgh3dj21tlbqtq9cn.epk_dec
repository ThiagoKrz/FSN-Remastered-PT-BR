55200::$$$message_0490_0000_0000$$$::   It smells like rain.[lr]::
55201::$$$message_0490_0000_0001$$$::The courtyard is empty, devoid of churchgoers.[lr]::
55202::$$$message_0490_0000_0002$$$::Instead, I come across...[lr]::
55203::$$$message_0490_0000_0003$$$::A man waiting for me, without his mistress.::
55204::$$$message_0490_0001_0000$$$::Strangely, I don't even wonder what he's doing here,[lr]::
55205::$$$message_0490_0001_0001$$$::or why he was waiting for me.::
55206::$$$message_0490_0002_0000$$$::The red knight watches me quietly for a moment, and then closes his eyes, as if coming to a decision.[lr]::
55207::$$$message_0490_0002_0001$$$::"I'm sure you understand, Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
55208::$$$message_0490_0002_0002$$$::What you are fighting. Whom you must kill."[lr]::
55209::$$$message_0490_0002_0003$$$::He gives a clearer answer than I ever could.::
55210::$$$message_0490_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55211::$$$message_0490_0003_0001$$$::The words are enough to freeze my heart cold.[lr]::
55212::$$$message_0490_0003_0002$$$::...I know.[lr]::
55213::$$$message_0490_0003_0003$$$::I said that I'd fight to put a stop to the war and keep innocent people from being caught up in the Masters' conflict.::
55214::$$$message_0490_0004_0000$$$::I asked Saber for help to carry out that decision.[lr]::
55215::$$$message_0490_0004_0001$$$::I won't hide from that.[lr]::
55216::$$$message_0490_0004_0002$$$::And now...Sakura is the Master I need to stop before anyone else.::
55217::$$$message_0490_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55218::$$$message_0490_0005_0001$$$::...I acknowledge it, but I can't say it out loud.[lr]::
55219::$$$message_0490_0005_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55220::$$$message_0490_0005_0003$$$::The red knight says nothing.[lr]::
55221::$$$message_0490_0005_0004$$$::We both stand there under the overcast sky, watching one another.::
55222::$$$message_0490_0006_0000$$$::"...Then do what you want. My objective has changed. Now that [font italic=true]it[font italic=false] has appeared, the time for personal vendettas is past."[lr]::
55223::$$$message_0490_0006_0001$$$::"Huh...?"::
55224::$$$message_0490_0007_0000$$$::"This is a warning.[lr]::
55225::$$$message_0490_0007_0001$$$::If you intend to stay true to your principles, then go ahead.[lr]::
55226::$$$message_0490_0007_0002$$$::But if you choose a different path, then Shirou Emiya has no future."[lr]::
55227::$$$message_0490_0007_0003$$$::"You mean I'm going to die?"::
55228::$$$message_0490_0008_0000$$$::"If you consider death the same as denying who you are.[lr]::
55229::$$$message_0490_0008_0001$$$::Until now, you've lived your life for the sake of everyone. Isn't that right? How can you twist your oath into abandoning everyone else so that one person may live?"::
55230::$$$message_0490_0009_0000$$$::His assertion doesn't carry a note of irony.[lr]::
55231::$$$message_0490_0009_0001$$$::I sense some kind of determination...and emptiness...in Archer's words.::
55232::$$$message_0490_0010_0000$$$::"I don't know or care which path Shirou Emiya will choose.[lr]::
55233::$$$message_0490_0010_0001$$$::But if you are going to deny everything you are and try to protect a single person...you will be judged for that sin."::
55234::$$$message_0490_0011_0000$$$::His footsteps fade into the distance.[lr]::
55235::$$$message_0490_0011_0001$$$::I start down the hill, plagued by doubts.::
55236::$$$message_0490_0012_0000$$$::Before I know it, I'm sitting on a park bench.[lr]::
55237::$$$message_0490_0012_0001$$$::I don't feel like going home, but I can't wait at the church, either.::
55238::$$$message_0490_0013_0000$$$::This park is far from both my house and the church.[lr]::
55239::$$$message_0490_0013_0001$$$::...It's been a few hours since I learned that Sakura is a Master.[lr]::
55240::$$$message_0490_0013_0002$$$::It's the perfect waiting spot to symbolize how I'm sitting on the fence, unable to make up my mind about anything.::
55241::$$$message_0490_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55242::$$$message_0490_0014_0001$$$::An answer.[lr]::
55243::$$$message_0490_0014_0002$$$::I need to come up with an answer, but my thoughts are scattered, and I can't figure out what I'm supposed to think about.::
55244::$$$message_0490_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...As the Matou heir, she has been experimented on for years.[font italic=false][lr]::
55245::$$$message_0490_0015_0001$$$::[font italic=true]It isn't difficult to imagine what sort of education Zouken had in store for her. Sakura Matou is not the chaste maiden you wish her to be, but a witch sullied by his worms.[font italic=false]::
55246::$$$message_0490_0016_0000$$$::"Shut...up..."[lr]::
55247::$$$message_0490_0016_0001$$$::I don't need him to repeat that to me.[lr]::
55248::$$$message_0490_0016_0002$$$::Even an upstart mage like me knows that.[lr]::
55249::$$$message_0490_0016_0003$$$::What it means, and everything she's had to go through. Why didn't...::
55250::$$$message_0490_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]While she tried to keep the truth from you, she always sought salvation. If you could not even realise that, you have no right to have feelings for her.[font italic=false]::
55251::$$$message_0490_0018_0000$$$::"Shut up, shut up, shut up! I know! I don't need you to tell me that!"[lr]::
55252::$$$message_0490_0018_0001$$$::Why...didn't...[lr]::
55253::$$$message_0490_0018_0002$$$::I notice at all?::
55254::$$$message_0490_0019_0000$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
55255::$$$message_0490_0019_0001$$$::My molars are broken.[lr]::
55256::$$$message_0490_0019_0002$$$::I've been clenching my jaw so much today, it would be a wonder if my teeth didn't break.::
55257::$$$message_0490_0020_0000$$$::"Dammit. Dammit, dammit, dammit!"[lr]::
55258::$$$message_0490_0020_0001$$$::I crush exposed nerves.[lr]::
55259::$$$message_0490_0020_0002$$$::The pain stabs into my head.[lr]::
55260::$$$message_0490_0020_0003$$$::It can't even tear apart the hatred in my mind.::
55261::$$$message_0490_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55262::$$$message_0490_0021_0001$$$::A fire blazes in my brain.[lr]::
55263::$$$message_0490_0021_0002$$$::When I think back on all our time together, now that I know the truth, it drives me crazy.::
55264::$$$message_0490_0022_0000$$$::Sakura was laughing.[lr]::
55265::$$$message_0490_0022_0001$$$::She always smiling peacefully.[lr]::
55266::$$$message_0490_0022_0002$$$::And I just basked in it, oblivious to all of her suffering.::
55267::$$$message_0490_0023_0000$$$::...It doesn't matter now whether her smile was genuine or forced.[lr]::
55268::$$$message_0490_0023_0001$$$::Now, when I realize how much pain she was hiding behind her smile, it makes me want to kill someone.::
55269::$$$message_0490_0024_0000$$$::"Zouken...Matou...!"[lr]::
55270::$$$message_0490_0024_0001$$$::I can't forgive him.[lr]::
55271::$$$message_0490_0024_0002$$$::I don't need him to atone. I just want to erase him right now from Sakura's life.::
55272::$$$message_0490_0025_0000$$$::It's all his fault.[lr]::
55273::$$$message_0490_0025_0001$$$::If not for Zouken, Sakura would have grown up like any other girl. She never would've had those bizarre Crest Worms implanted in her.[lr]::
55274::$$$message_0490_0025_0002$$$::If not for Zouken, she never would have become a Master, Shinji would never have fallen so far, and they would've lived normal lives.[lr]::
55275::$$$message_0490_0025_0003$$$::That's why...[lr]::
55276::$$$message_0490_0025_0004$$$::If I can just get rid of him, then all this will...!::
55277::$$$message_0490_0026_0000$$$::I punch the bench,[lr]::
55278::$$$message_0490_0026_0001$$$::tearing open the wound on my left hand, and splattering the white bench with red blood.[lr]::
55279::$$$message_0490_0026_0002$$$::The colorful contrast brings me to my senses.::
55280::$$$message_0490_0027_0000$$$::"I'm so weak, saying that. What can I even do about it?"[lr]::
55281::$$$message_0490_0027_0001$$$::I run out of pity for my own stupidity.::
55282::$$$message_0490_0028_0000$$$::"...That doesn't matter. Blaming people won't fix anything."[lr]::
55283::$$$message_0490_0028_0001$$$::But does it make me feel any better?[lr]::
55284::$$$message_0490_0028_0002$$$::I won't deny what Zouken's done to Sakura, what he's here to do now.[lr]::
55285::$$$message_0490_0028_0003$$$::Thinking about it disgusts me, and, like a snake's tongue flicking out, makes me feel envy at having something precious stolen from me.::
55286::$$$message_0490_0029_0000$$$::It doesn't make my failures any better, either.[lr]::
55287::$$$message_0490_0029_0001$$$::I'm the one who didn't notice it.[lr]::
55288::$$$message_0490_0029_0002$$$::No matter what Zouken might've done, I was the only person who failed to notice any of it.::
55289::$$$message_0490_0030_0000$$$::"No. I didn't fail to realize it. I..."[lr]::
55290::$$$message_0490_0030_0001$$$::...didn't even try to notice.[lr]::
55291::$$$message_0490_0030_0002$$$::The night I faced off against Zouken.[lr]::
55292::$$$message_0490_0030_0003$$$::He said that Sakura wasn't involved, and I believed him.::
55293::$$$message_0490_0031_0000$$$::...What an idiot I am.[lr]::
55294::$$$message_0490_0031_0001$$$::Why did I believe what he said?[lr]::
55295::$$$message_0490_0031_0002$$$::As long as Sakura's one of the Matous, there's no way she isn't related.[lr]::
55296::$$$message_0490_0031_0003$$$::The night I lost Saber, I experienced firsthand how that fiend Zouken views human life.[lr]::
55297::$$$message_0490_0031_0004$$$::He gave Rider to Shinji, so he'd be just as willing to do something to Sakura.::
55298::$$$message_0490_0032_0000$$$::And yet...[lr]::
55299::$$$message_0490_0032_0001$$$::I ate up every lie he fed me, just because it would've been convenient if they were true.::
55300::$$$message_0490_0033_0000$$$::I actually did notice, back then.[lr]::
55301::$$$message_0490_0033_0001$$$::I would've arrived at the truth, if I'd just thought about it a little.[lr]::
55302::$$$message_0490_0033_0002$$$::...That's why I wasn't surprised.[lr]::
55303::$$$message_0490_0033_0003$$$::When I learned Sakura was a Master and that she'd endured an upbringing that she could never talk about, it all felt obvious to me.[lr]::
55304::$$$message_0490_0033_0004$$$::I tried not to think about it because I couldn't bear to come to terms with it.::
55305::$$$message_0490_0034_0000$$$::If I noticed it, then I'd have to fight.[lr]::
55306::$$$message_0490_0034_0001$$$::If Zouken Matou is evil to other humans,[lr]::
55307::$$$message_0490_0034_0002$$$::then the right thing to do would be to fight the evildoer.::
55308::$$$message_0490_0035_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55309::$$$message_0490_0035_0001$$$::No...[lr]::
55310::$$$message_0490_0035_0002$$$::The right path is already laid out for me.[lr]::
55311::$$$message_0490_0035_0003$$$::If Sakura becomes Zouken's puppet and makes Rider indiscriminately attack people again, then there's only one thing for me to do.::
55312::$$$message_0490_0036_0000$$$::That's why I've trained myself in magecraft and lived the way I do: [lr]::
55313::$$$message_0490_0036_0001$$$::to save people from disasters beyond their control.::
55314::$$$message_0490_0037_0000$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
55315::$$$message_0490_0037_0001$$$::So, I already know what to do.[lr]::
55316::$$$message_0490_0037_0002$$$::The red knight was right.::
55317::$$$message_0490_0038_0000$$$::[font italic=true]Senpai, if I become a bad person...[font italic=false]::
55318::$$$message_0490_0039_0000$$$::I don't want to hurt Sakura, and I sympathize with her.[lr]::
55319::$$$message_0490_0039_0001$$$::But she isn't an exception.[lr]::
55320::$$$message_0490_0039_0002$$$::No matter how precious she is to me, if it means allowing another tragedy to happen...::
55321::$$$message_0490_0040_0000$$$::                                        [font italic=true]As long as it's you, Senpai.[font italic=false]::
55322::$$$message_0490_0041_0000$$$::"Urgh, brrgh...!"[lr]::
55323::$$$message_0490_0041_0001$$$::...then I have to eliminate her.[lr]::
55324::$$$message_0490_0041_0002$$$::It's nothing to hesitate about. So why...?[lr]::
55325::$$$message_0490_0041_0003$$$::"Hah... uugh... guh...!"[lr]::
55326::$$$message_0490_0041_0004$$$::Why am I trying so hard to keep down the vomit rising to my throat...?::
55327::$$$message_0490_0042_0000$$$::"Ah... hah, hah, hah..."[lr]::
55328::$$$message_0490_0042_0001$$$::I endure the nausea.[lr]::
55329::$$$message_0490_0042_0002$$$::...I wonder how long I've been sitting here.[lr]::
55330::$$$message_0490_0042_0003$$$::I don't have time to fixate on trivial thoughts.[lr]::
55331::$$$message_0490_0042_0004$$$::Tohsaka said she'd be back once the surgery is finished.[lr]::
55332::$$$message_0490_0042_0005$$$::The town smells like rain.[lr]::
55333::$$$message_0490_0042_0006$$$::I'll go back to the church and check on Sakura one more time before it starts to pour. Then[line2]::
55334::$$$message_0490_0043_0000$$$::"Let's play, Shirou!"[lr]::
55335::$$$message_0490_0043_0001$$$::Something crashes into me.[lr]::
55336::$$$message_0490_0043_0002$$$::I'm suddenly hugged from behind.::
55337::$$$message_0490_0044_0000$$$::"...Illya."[lr]::
55338::$$$message_0490_0044_0001$$$::Even without turning around, I know who it is.[lr]::
55339::$$$message_0490_0044_0002$$$::This pale girl is the person I always meet in this park.::
55340::$$$message_0490_0045_0000$$$::"Ehehe! Did I scare you? I saw you walking around town, so I came to see you!"[lr]::
55341::$$$message_0490_0045_0001$$$::Illya laughs cheerfully.::
55342::$$$message_0490_0046_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55343::$$$message_0490_0046_0001$$$::Her innocence hurts.[lr]::
55344::$$$message_0490_0046_0002$$$::I know it's selfish, but right now, I don't want to see anyone laughing.::
55345::$$$message_0490_0047_0000$$$::"Ah. Why are you ignoring me, Shirou? It's rude to sulk when a girl is talking to you."[lr]::
55346::$$$message_0490_0047_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
55347::$$$message_0490_0047_0002$$$::...I wish she'd be quiet.[lr]::
55348::$$$message_0490_0047_0003$$$::To be honest, I don't have time for this right now.::
55349::$$$message_0490_0048_0000$$$::"Mrgh! Hey, Shirou! You should listen when people are speaking to you!"[lr]::
55350::$$$message_0490_0048_0001$$$::"...Illya. Sorry, but I don't have time for this.[lr]::
55351::$$$message_0490_0048_0002$$$::Go play by yourself."::
55352::$$$message_0490_0049_0000$$$::"Aww, but that's boring. I came all the way here to see you.[lr]::
55353::$$$message_0490_0049_0001$$$::You haven't come by since then, and if I let you go today, you won't show up again."::
55354::$$$message_0490_0050_0000$$$::"...We never promised to meet here every day. Plus, it's nighttime. Aren't Masters supposed to kill each other if they see each other at night?"::
55355::$$$message_0490_0051_0000$$$::As soon as I say those unkind words, my nausea returns.[lr]::
55356::$$$message_0490_0051_0001$$$::...I despise myself so much I want to hit myself.[lr]::
55357::$$$message_0490_0051_0002$$$::Illya's just trying to make me feel better, but I'm pushing her away.::
55358::$$$message_0490_0052_0000$$$::"Why? You're not a Master anymore, so I can just let you leave."[lr]::
55359::$$$message_0490_0052_0001$$$::"...! You know I'm not a Master anymore, Illya?"::
55360::$$$message_0490_0053_0000$$$::"Mm-hm! I know everything! You lost Saber, and Rin lost to Rider. But Rider's Master collapsed, so there are only two of us left, right?"[lr]::
55361::$$$message_0490_0053_0001$$$::Illya recounts it all cheerfully.::
55362::$$$message_0490_0054_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55363::$$$message_0490_0054_0001$$$::It almost sounds like she's laughing at Sakura's fate.::
55364::$$$message_0490_0055_0000$$$::"Victory is within sight. Rider's Master is going to self-destruct, and Archer's no big deal.[lr]::
55365::$$$message_0490_0055_0001$$$::Now that Saber's gone, there's no one left who can beat my Berserker.[lr]::
55366::$$$message_0490_0055_0002$$$::So come on, let's play! You're not a Master anymore, so I'll invite you to my castle!"::
55367::$$$message_0490_0056_0000$$$::Illya rudely tries to hug me.[lr]::
55368::$$$message_0490_0056_0001$$$::Her carefree smile irritates me.[lr]::
55369::$$$message_0490_0056_0002$$$::"Shut up! I told you I don't have time! Go play by yourself!"[lr]::
55370::$$$message_0490_0056_0003$$$::"Aah!?"[lr]::
55371::$$$message_0490_0056_0004$$$::I shove Illya away in anger.::
55372::$$$message_0490_0057_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
55373::$$$message_0490_0057_0001$$$::   It's too late to regret it.[lr]::
55374::$$$message_0490_0057_0002$$$::Illya stands there in surprise.[lr]::
55375::$$$message_0490_0057_0003$$$::I don't have to look at her to tell how shocked she is.::
55376::$$$message_0490_0058_0000$$$::...I threw aside her sincere goodwill.[lr]::
55377::$$$message_0490_0058_0001$$$::   All of the kindness she's shown me just went down the drain.::
55378::$$$message_0490_0059_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
55379::$$$message_0490_0060_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
