42463::$$$message_0371_0000_0000$$$::All right, even though people have said this Tiger Dojo is meaningless, it's already the twenty-third one.::
42464::$$$message_0371_0000_0001$$$::Well. This is sudden, but this is the last Tiger Dojo of part two!::
42465::$$$message_0371_0000_0002$$$::Huh? Master, according to the schedule, it looks like we have more practice in part two.::
42466::$$$message_0371_0000_0003$$$::Kahhhh! Don't talk about the twenty-fourth one![lr]::
42467::$$$message_0371_0000_0004$$$::I have no business with a weakling that will reach a dead end like that!::
42468::$$$message_0371_0000_0005$$$::Y-Yes, ma'am![lr]::
42469::$$$message_0371_0000_0006$$$::I don't really get it, but this is the last Tiger Dojo of part two in reality!?::
42470::$$$message_0371_0000_0007$$$::That's right.::
42471::$$$message_0371_0000_0008$$$::There was a rumor on the last Tiger Dojo in part one that this corner would be powered up from part two, but I won't be falling for something like that this time.::
42472::$$$message_0371_0000_0009$$$::The dojo will stay like this, and I will preserve the small paradise operated modestly by me and my first student.::
42473::$$$message_0371_0000_0010$$$::...Heh.::
42474::$$$message_0371_0000_0011$$$::Oh man, I feel like I'm going to get betrayed.[lr]::
42475::$$$message_0371_0000_0012$$$::Could this devil child be scheming something again?::
42476::$$$message_0371_0000_0013$$$::Oh, that's a misunderstanding.[lr]::
42477::$$$message_0371_0000_0014$$$::I'm just thinking that I might make you feel lonely since I won't be able to keep you company in part three like I have been.::
42478::$$$message_0371_0000_0015$$$::Huh...!? You can't come to the dojo!? Could it be, Illya...!?::
42479::$$$message_0371_0000_0016$$$::Yes, I'll be busy taking part in the main storyline.[lr]::
42480::$$$message_0371_0000_0017$$$::It ended up like this in the Rin route, but part three is when my true worth comes out.::
42481::$$$message_0371_0000_0018$$$::On the other hand, it seems like you'll be appearing less in the main storyline.[lr]::
42482::$$$message_0371_0000_0019$$$::My condolences. This is the difference in status between a heroine candidate and one who was not even considered to be a candidate.::
42483::$$$message_0371_0000_0020$$$::Well, I'll still be friends with you even if I become a heroine, so don't worry. When I take over the main storyline, I can at least make you my servant...::
42484::$$$message_0371_0000_0021$$$::...Hi-yah!::
42485::$$$message_0371_0000_0022$$$::What was that for!? I was saying this out of goodwill!::
42486::$$$message_0371_0000_0023$$$::I don't need it! I don't need love if it's this painful!::
42487::$$$message_0371_0000_0024$$$::Actually, you're disqualified from being my student! You'll be too bright to look at directly if you become a heroine![lr]::
42488::$$$message_0371_0000_0025$$$::Get out, get out, wahhh!::
42489::$$$message_0371_0000_0026$$$::Humph, I'm quitting as well![lr]::
42490::$$$message_0371_0000_0027$$$::Stupid Taiga, I won't forgive you even if you apologize...!::
42491::$$$message_0371_0000_0028$$$::...She's gone.[lr]::
42492::$$$message_0371_0000_0029$$$::Well, this is fate. If my cute student can make a comeback as heroine, then it is also my role as her master to be hated.::
42493::$$$message_0371_0000_0030$$$:: Fight, Illya! Go after Sakura and take her spot as heroine!::
42494::$$$message_0371_0000_0031$$$::Don't come back here! You're going to take some of my roles!::
42495::$$$message_0371_0000_0032$$$::...Oof. But, it's lonely doing the last Tiger Dojo of part two by myself.[lr]::
42496::$$$message_0371_0000_0033$$$::It's lonely, but I'll do my best. Fight the good fight soldier. I'll hold down the fort.::
42497::$$$message_0371_0000_0034$$$::Well, this dead end is a bit special.[lr]::
42498::$$$message_0371_0000_0035$$$::It's too reckless for Miss Tohsaka and Shirou to fight by themselves. There's no way they can win.::
42499::$$$message_0371_0000_0036$$$::I know you may harbor a grudge, but go ahead and shake hands with the ally that appeared.::
42500::$$$message_0371_0000_0037$$$::And, for those of you who didn't even have an ally appear![lr]::
42501::$$$message_0371_0000_0038$$$::You're a failure as the main character! How can you not save a girl that's dying in front of you!?::
42502::$$$message_0371_0000_0039$$$::The events at the castle are an important episode that reveals a certain cause that has been hidden until now, so you must pass through it.::
42503::$$$message_0371_0000_0040$$$::Miss Tohsaka's route is the main character's route in a way. So go ahead and solve the problem.::
42504::$$$message_0371_0000_0041$$$::   Well, this is it.[lr]::
42505::$$$message_0371_0000_0042$$$::Miss Tohsaka's route is entering its climax.::
42506::$$$message_0371_0000_0043$$$::There will be a series of hectic events without a dead end after this, but let me give you some good news.::
42507::$$$message_0371_0000_0044$$$::Miss Tohsaka's route has a "true end" and a "good end" prepared.::
42508::$$$message_0371_0000_0045$$$::I can't say what they're about, but the condition for how they branch is how earnest you are. If it's only one or a lady on each arm. You get to find out after the battle.::
42509::$$$message_0371_0000_0046$$$:: All right everyone, I'll be waiting in part three of Tiger Dojo!::®À
