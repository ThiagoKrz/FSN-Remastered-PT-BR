65389::$$$message_0601_0000_0000$$$::    The door closes.[lr]::
65390::$$$message_0601_0000_0001$$$::As if convincing himself, the boy swore he'd protect the girl over and over. Then, he watched her fall asleep and left the room.::
65391::$$$message_0601_0001_0000$$$::"...Ahh."[lr]::
65392::$$$message_0601_0001_0001$$$::In the dim light, Sakura Matou heaves a pained sigh.[lr]::
65393::$$$message_0601_0001_0002$$$::She hasn't been sleeping.[lr]::
65394::$$$message_0601_0001_0003$$$::She only pretended to sleep to let the even more exhausted boy rest.::
65395::$$$message_0601_0002_0000$$$::Besides, she can't sleep anymore.[lr]::
65396::$$$message_0601_0002_0001$$$::If she does, she'll dream.[lr]::
65397::$$$message_0601_0002_0002$$$::She'll watch something that looks like her kill people.[lr]::
65398::$$$message_0601_0002_0003$$$::It terrifies her.[lr]::
65399::$$$message_0601_0002_0004$$$::She doesn't remember what she dreamed last night.[lr]::
65400::$$$message_0601_0002_0005$$$::She has no memory of what happened before she passed out in front of the house.::
65401::$$$message_0601_0003_0000$$$::So, she's sure that if she falls asleep tonight, she'll never wake up again.[lr]::
65402::$$$message_0601_0003_0001$$$::She'll lose her mind for good and betray the boy who embraced her.[lr]::
65403::$$$message_0601_0003_0002$$$::The boy abandoned himself and chose to believe in the weak and dishonest Sakura Matou instead.[lr]::
65404::$$$message_0601_0003_0003$$$::His conviction pains her. She knows that if she becomes the way she is in her dreams, she won't be able to face him again.::
65405::$$$message_0601_0004_0000$$$::   That's right.[lr]::
65406::$$$message_0601_0004_0001$$$::She has broken his heart, and it can never be fixed.[lr]::
65407::$$$message_0601_0004_0002$$$::So, she has to endure this.[lr]::
65408::$$$message_0601_0004_0003$$$::She must stay awake and hold on to her mind as long as she can, so that she never has that dream again.[lr]::
65409::$$$message_0601_0004_0004$$$::Even she has someone willing to protect her.[lr]::
65410::$$$message_0601_0004_0005$$$::If there's even a shred left of her nasty, cowardly self...then Sakura Matou needs to hold onto it with all her might.::
65411::$$$message_0601_0005_0000$$$::"I'm fine with that. But..."[lr]::
65412::$$$message_0601_0005_0001$$$::...Some things can never go back to the way they were.[lr]::
65413::$$$message_0601_0005_0002$$$::She's committed sins that she'll never be able to atone for.::
65414::$$$message_0601_0006_0000$$$::                                                      [font italic=true]"I'll protect you."[font italic=false]::
65415::$$$message_0601_0007_0000$$$::He repeated that promise, knowing that there was no hope, no future.[lr]::
65416::$$$message_0601_0007_0001$$$::The memory of it brings tears to her eyes.[lr]::
65417::$$$message_0601_0007_0002$$$::Half an hour ago,[lr]::
65418::$$$message_0601_0007_0003$$$::when he came into the room, she made up her mind.[lr]::
65419::$$$message_0601_0007_0004$$$::She knows what it feels like when someone comes to kill her.[lr]::
65420::$$$message_0601_0007_0005$$$::Right now, she's sensitive to hostility. She'd sense someone coming for her life even if she was asleep.::
65421::$$$message_0601_0008_0000$$$::...But it was an empty bloodlust.[lr]::
65422::$$$message_0601_0008_0001$$$::Not devoid of feeling,[lr]::
65423::$$$message_0601_0008_0002$$$::but a pitiful void, like a gaping hole opened in his chest, allowing a cold breeze to flow through it.[lr]::
65424::$$$message_0601_0008_0003$$$::She accepted that she would die here.[lr]::
65425::$$$message_0601_0008_0004$$$::She thought it would be best if the boy was the one to stop her.::
65426::$$$message_0601_0009_0000$$$::"...ry."[lr]::
65427::$$$message_0601_0009_0001$$$::But she was too timid, too cowardly.[lr]::
65428::$$$message_0601_0009_0002$$$::She told herself it was all right to die, but she couldn't stop herself from shaking.[lr]::
65429::$$$message_0601_0009_0003$$$::    She did it again.[lr]::
65430::$$$message_0601_0009_0004$$$::She drove him into a corner with excuses convenient only for her.::
65431::$$$message_0601_0010_0000$$$::"...orry."[lr]::
65432::$$$message_0601_0010_0001$$$::He embraced her.[lr]::
65433::$$$message_0601_0010_0002$$$::The boy embraced her, despite everything.[lr]::
65434::$$$message_0601_0010_0003$$$::They both know they have no future.[lr]::
65435::$$$message_0601_0010_0004$$$::He knew where his choice would lead, and he hugged her anyway.::
65436::$$$message_0601_0011_0000$$$::She felt his determination.[lr]::
65437::$$$message_0601_0011_0001$$$::His embrace told her that he would combine their sins and face the consequences together.::
65438::$$$message_0601_0012_0000$$$::"Hngh... I'm sorry, Senpai..."[lr]::
65439::$$$message_0601_0012_0001$$$::It made her sad.[lr]::
65440::$$$message_0601_0012_0002$$$::She's always known that[lr]::
65441::$$$message_0601_0012_0003$$$::he's someone who can do that.[lr]::
65442::$$$message_0601_0012_0004$$$::...In the dusk-lit school yard,[lr]::
65443::$$$message_0601_0012_0005$$$::she watched a stranger run, over and over.[lr]::
65444::$$$message_0601_0012_0006$$$::The boy in the distance changed her whispers of "give up" into "good luck."::
65445::$$$message_0601_0013_0000$$$::Her wish was born at that moment.[lr]::
65446::$$$message_0601_0013_0001$$$::   She wants to be with him.[lr]::
65447::$$$message_0601_0013_0002$$$::   She wants him to protect her.[lr]::
65448::$$$message_0601_0013_0003$$$::She adored him without knowing why, and when her grandfather ordered her to go to the Emiya house, her dream came true.::
65449::$$$message_0601_0014_0000$$$::"I'll protect you, because I swore that I'd be on your side."::
65450::$$$message_0601_0015_0000$$$::"Ngh...nngh...!"[lr]::
65451::$$$message_0601_0015_0001$$$::This is the result of that promise.[lr]::
65452::$$$message_0601_0015_0002$$$::He's going to keep breaking for the rest of his life.::
65453::$$$message_0601_0016_0000$$$::"Sorry... I'm sorry, Senpai..."[lr]::
65454::$$$message_0601_0016_0001$$$::She finally understands[lr]::
65455::$$$message_0601_0016_0002$$$::why she looked up to him.[lr]::
65456::$$$message_0601_0016_0003$$$::To the girl, the boy was beautiful.[lr]::
65457::$$$message_0601_0016_0004$$$::She was pathetic, but he was different.[lr]::
65458::$$$message_0601_0016_0005$$$::He was straightforward, and she wished for him to stay that way.::
65459::$$$message_0601_0017_0000$$$::"But now, I've..."[lr]::
65460::$$$message_0601_0017_0001$$$::...Yes, she's remembered.[lr]::
65461::$$$message_0601_0017_0002$$$::She wanted to protect him.[lr]::
65462::$$$message_0601_0017_0003$$$::I wanted to protect him.[lr]::
65463::$$$message_0601_0017_0004$$$::That awkward, honest person she saw in the yard that afternoon was precious to her, and she wanted to protect him.[lr]::
65464::$$$message_0601_0017_0005$$$::"I...broke him."::
65465::$$$message_0601_0018_0000$$$::That's all she ever wanted.[lr]::
65466::$$$message_0601_0018_0001$$$::So, why...[lr]::
65467::$$$message_0601_0018_0002$$$::Why did she do this to him?::
65468::$$$message_0601_0019_0000$$$::...And so,[lr]::
65469::$$$message_0601_0019_0001$$$::during a span of time which would've been interrupted if she hadn't had her mind focused, she made her final choice.::
65470::$$$message_0601_0020_0000$$$::"Are you there, Rider?"[lr]::
65471::$$$message_0601_0020_0001$$$::She calls out into the darkness.[lr]::
65472::$$$message_0601_0020_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
65473::$$$message_0601_0020_0003$$$::A woman appears out of thin air, like a ghost.[lr]::
65474::$$$message_0601_0020_0004$$$::She is Rider, Sakura Matou's Servant.::
65475::$$$message_0601_0021_0000$$$::"...I knew it. Have you been protecting me?"[lr]::
65476::$$$message_0601_0021_0001$$$::"Yes. I would have killed him if he raised a hand against you."[lr]::
65477::$$$message_0601_0021_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65478::$$$message_0601_0021_0003$$$::She sighs. That was a close call.[lr]::
65479::$$$message_0601_0021_0004$$$::Rider would give priority to her Master's life.[lr]::
65480::$$$message_0601_0021_0005$$$::She only judges people based on whether they threaten her Master or not.[lr]::
65481::$$$message_0601_0021_0006$$$::Meaning that a moment ago, Shirou Emiya was undoubtedly Rider's enemy.::
65482::$$$message_0601_0022_0000$$$::"...Don't hurt Senpai, Rider. I won't forgive you if you do."[lr]::
65483::$$$message_0601_0022_0001$$$::"My role is to protect you, Sakura. If he becomes your enemy, then I must fulfill my duty. I will protect Sakura Matou, no matter what happens to you."[lr]::
65484::$$$message_0601_0022_0002$$$::"...Even if I'm no longer myself?"::
65485::$$$message_0601_0023_0000$$$::Rider doesn't say anything.[lr]::
65486::$$$message_0601_0023_0001$$$::That's the answer Sakura fears the most.[lr]::
65487::$$$message_0601_0023_0002$$$::Indeed...[lr]::
65488::$$$message_0601_0023_0003$$$::Even if Shirou Emiya is Sakura Matou's ally,[lr]::
65489::$$$message_0601_0023_0004$$$::Rider will view him as an enemy to be defeated if she judges him a threat to Sakura.::
65490::$$$message_0601_0024_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
65491::$$$message_0601_0024_0001$$$::The girl sits up and clenches her fist.[lr]::
65492::$$$message_0601_0024_0002$$$::...She isn't angry at Rider.[lr]::
65493::$$$message_0601_0024_0003$$$::She's just afraid that her hypothesis might turn out to be true.::
65494::$$$message_0601_0025_0000$$$::"...Sakura?[lr]::
65495::$$$message_0601_0025_0001$$$::What do you think you're doing? You're in no condition to use magecraft!"[lr]::
65496::$$$message_0601_0025_0002$$$::The girl ignores Rider's warning and raises her right hand towards the gloom.::
65497::$$$message_0601_0026_0000$$$::She feeds her power into it for just an instant.[lr]::
65498::$$$message_0601_0026_0001$$$::After a flash of light, her right hand is the only thing that's changed.[lr]::
65499::$$$message_0601_0026_0002$$$::"Sakura."[lr]::
65500::$$$message_0601_0026_0003$$$::"This is my last Command Spell. Please, Rider. No matter what happens from now on, protect Senpai until the very end."[lr]::
65501::$$$message_0601_0026_0004$$$::The girl pants as she issues her final order.[lr]::
65502::$$$message_0601_0026_0005$$$::Sakura Matou's hand no longer glows with the light of Command Spells.::
65503::$$$message_0601_0027_0000$$$::"...I'll stop Grandfather.[lr]::
65504::$$$message_0601_0027_0001$$$::This is a Matou problem... It's overdue, but I won't cause Shirou any more trouble."[lr]::
65505::$$$message_0601_0027_0002$$$::She declares her next move, holding back a cough.[lr]::
65506::$$$message_0601_0027_0003$$$::Her eyes burn bright in the darkness.[lr]::
65507::$$$message_0601_0027_0004$$$::Their frail glow marks the determination of a mage.::
