55156::$$$message_0489_0000_0000$$$::   My stiff legs won't move.[lr]::
55157::$$$message_0489_0000_0001$$$::Paralyzed, I can only watch helplessly as a dark spear stabs Tohsaka.[lr]::
55158::$$$message_0489_0000_0002$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
55159::$$$message_0489_0000_0003$$$::Suddenly, it changes course.::
55160::$$$message_0489_0001_0000$$$::   The lethal weapon diverts.[lr]::
55161::$$$message_0489_0001_0001$$$::Instead of flying straight into Tohsaka's chest, it changes direction right before impact.[lr]::
55162::$$$message_0489_0001_0002$$$::The black spearhead swivels.[lr]::
55163::$$$message_0489_0001_0003$$$::It comes for me greedily, as if it's discovered a more delicious prey.::
55164::$$$message_0489_0002_0000$$$::"...Ow."[lr]::
55165::$$$message_0489_0002_0001$$$::I hear a dull impact.[lr]::
55166::$$$message_0489_0002_0002$$$::...My body is hot.[lr]::
55167::$$$message_0489_0002_0003$$$::My vision gets all soft and twisty, like I've caught a serious fever.::
55168::$$$message_0489_0002_0004$$$::"Senpai?"::
55169::$$$message_0489_0002_0005$$$::...I think I hear a familiar voice, far away.[lr]::
55170::$$$message_0489_0002_0006$$$::I'm losing my grip on reality.[lr]::
55171::$$$message_0489_0002_0007$$$::In my white, hazy mind, the blood coming from my left arm mixes like paint on a canvas.::
55172::$$$message_0489_0002_0008$$$::"No..."::
55173::$$$message_0489_0002_0009$$$::With her hands clenched at her chest, Sakura stares in shock at me on the ground.::
55174::$$$message_0489_0002_0010$$$::"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"::
55175::$$$message_0489_0002_0011$$$::I see her fall like a puppet with its strings cut.::
55176::$$$message_0489_0002_0012$$$::"How are you feeling? Have you calmed down?"[lr]::
55177::$$$message_0489_0002_0013$$$::"..."[lr]::
55178::$$$message_0489_0002_0014$$$::Sitting on one of the church pews, I nod wordlessly.::
55179::$$$message_0489_0003_0000$$$::"Okay. Then you don't need healing. You'll recover along with your physical stamina, so try to rest for now."::
55180::$$$message_0489_0004_0000$$$::Tohsaka takes a seat a slight distance from me.[lr]::
55181::$$$message_0489_0004_0001$$$::...But our emotional distance is many times wider.[lr]::
55182::$$$message_0489_0004_0002$$$::We're just waiting in the chapel for Kotomine, not making small talk.::
55183::$$$message_0489_0005_0000$$$::"Ngh."[lr]::
55184::$$$message_0489_0005_0001$$$::When I try to clench my left hand, it twiches numbly.[lr]::
55185::$$$message_0489_0005_0002$$$::The pain feels like a nail was driven through my palm.[lr]::
55186::$$$message_0489_0005_0003$$$::My left hand hurt more from gripping the knife than the dull pain of Rider's beating or Sakura stabbing me through the left arm.::
55187::$$$message_0489_0006_0000$$$::Dark clouds obscure the night sky.[lr]::
55188::$$$message_0489_0006_0001$$$::They seem like rain clouds announcing an imminent shower.::
55189::$$$message_0489_0007_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
55190::$$$message_0489_0007_0001$$$::...The spear-like thing that attacked Tohsaka was apparently Sakura's magecraft.::
55191::$$$message_0489_0008_0000$$$::The Matous pass down Absorption magecraft through their family.[lr]::
55192::$$$message_0489_0008_0001$$$::Sakura unconsciously unleashed her magecraft because she was suffering from magical energy deficiency.[lr]::
55193::$$$message_0489_0008_0002$$$::Seeking help, she accidentally hit me in the left arm, sucking me dry of my power.::
55194::$$$message_0489_0009_0000$$$::Magical energy is life energy.[lr]::
55195::$$$message_0489_0009_0001$$$::It stands to reason that one would collapse if it was taken away.[lr]::
55196::$$$message_0489_0009_0002$$$::Already exhausted from fighting Rider, I fainted right away, and then Tohsaka brought us to the chruch.[lr]::
55197::$$$message_0489_0009_0003$$$::...She says that Sakura lost consciousness at the same time I did.::
55198::$$$message_0489_0010_0000$$$::"...She attacked herself."[lr]::
55199::$$$message_0489_0010_0001$$$::Tohsaka murmurs, explaining that Sakura is being treated in the back of the church.::6F
