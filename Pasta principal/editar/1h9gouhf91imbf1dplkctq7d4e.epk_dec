57267::$$$message_0505_0000_0000$$$::Um...this is the Tiger Dojo, but isn't it strange?::
57268::$$$message_0505_0000_0001$$$::Osu! Not really.[lr]::
57269::$$$message_0505_0000_0002$$$::It's the usual fun and peaceful Tiger Dojo!::
57270::$$$message_0505_0000_0003$$$::Ugh, I feel bloodthirst again... No, this isn't just my imagination! I sense something really bad watching me!::
57271::$$$message_0505_0000_0004$$$::So, this dead end is one of the usual abrupt deaths!::
57272::$$$message_0505_0000_0005$$$::You can't escape Rider's Mystic Eyes after making eye contact. It would be wise to focus on defense instead of trying to defeat her.::
57273::$$$message_0505_0000_0006$$$::Wait! Hold it! Something's definitely off. Someone's behind us! But I'm too scared to turn around and see who!::
57274::$$$message_0505_0000_0007$$$::Hmm. Shirou sure dies in all kinds of ways, huh.[lr]::
57275::$$$message_0505_0000_0008$$$::Petrification's rare, even in our line of work.::
57276::$$$message_0505_0000_0009$$$::It's close! An odd death lurks nearby![lr]::
57277::$$$message_0505_0000_0010$$$::Why is this happening to me!?::
57278::$$$message_0505_0000_0011$$$::Because Sakura's the type to hold a grudge, right?::
57279::$$$message_0505_0000_0012$$$::Remember when I said in front of you that Rider's Master is a rotten snake at her core?::
57280::$$$message_0505_0000_0013$$$::Wow. You did? Maybe, maybe not...::
57281::$$$message_0505_0000_0014$$$::Whoa, aaahhh![lr]::
57282::$$$message_0505_0000_0015$$$::Somebody heeeelp!::
57283::$$$message_0505_0001_0000$$$::That's all for this Tiger Dojo!::
57284::$$$message_0505_0001_0001$$$::If you curse someone, dig two graves.[lr]::
57285::$$$message_0505_0001_0002$$$::Be careful when you talk behind people's backs!::
