78029::$$$message_0725_0000_0000$$$::    We wait for nightfall, then head out into town.[lr]::
78030::$$$message_0725_0000_0001$$$::That's what Saber and I decided after discussing it.::
78031::$$$message_0725_0001_0000$$$::Like Kotomine said, I can't sense the other Masters.[lr]::
78032::$$$message_0725_0001_0001$$$::Only Saber can detect our enemies, and only when she's physically near the other Servants.::
78033::$$$message_0725_0002_0000$$$::So, the obvious course of action is to patrol the city on foot.[lr]::
78034::$$$message_0725_0002_0001$$$::It just happened to seem like a good idea to me, but Saber said that it was a "risky but certain" choice.::
78035::$$$message_0725_0003_0000$$$::A Master shouldn't stay holed up in his hideout.[lr]::
78036::$$$message_0725_0003_0001$$$::The Holy Grail War is a competition between Masters, so they'll all do whatever they can to come in first place.[lr]::
78037::$$$message_0725_0003_0002$$$::To do that, Servants search for opposing Masters' hideouts, while Masters set magical traps for each other.[lr]::
78038::$$$message_0725_0003_0003$$$::And everyone exposes themselves to a degree while doing that.::
78039::$$$message_0725_0004_0000$$$::Servant or Master, they still need magical energy to operate. Even if I can't sense other mages, I can at least sniff out traces of their spent energy.[lr]::
78040::$$$message_0725_0004_0001$$$::If I canvass the city looking for those traces, then I might find clues leading to the other Masters.::
78041::$$$message_0725_0005_0000$$$::...Of course, that requires me to offer myself up as bait.[lr]::
78042::$$$message_0725_0005_0001$$$::Like Father Kotomine said, it's the only thing I can do.::
78043::$$$message_0725_0006_0000$$$::We'll start our patrols tonight.[lr]::
78044::$$$message_0725_0006_0001$$$::Saber insisted that I stay home while she patrols the town, but I countered that we were supposed to be fighting side by side.::
78045::$$$message_0725_0007_0000$$$::After a long and fruitless argument...[lr]::
78046::$$$message_0725_0007_0001$$$::"...Very well. But promise me that you will act with me at all times. Will you swear not to venture outside alone at night?"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
78047::$$$message_0725_0007_0002$$$::Finally, Saber gave in.::
78048::$$$message_0725_0008_0000$$$::Now, then...[lr]::
78049::$$$message_0725_0008_0001$$$::We've decided on our plan of action, so there are two more problems left to address.::
78050::$$$message_0725_0009_0000$$$::"Shirou. As I explained earlier, I cannot make use of surplus magical energy. That is doubly true if we decide to head out tonight."::
78051::$$$message_0725_0010_0000$$$::"Yeah, you mentioned that you'd be sleeping whenever you can to save power.[lr]::
78052::$$$message_0725_0010_0001$$$::You have to maintain your physical body on your own, since you're not getting any energy from me.[lr]::
78053::$$$message_0725_0010_0002$$$::You recover eight points of magical energy a day, and it takes six to maintain your body. That leaves two in reserve.[lr]::
78054::$$$message_0725_0010_0003$$$::In a regular fight you would spend, um, ten points at best?"::
78055::$$$message_0725_0011_0000$$$::"Only as long as I avoid being wounded and my armor stays intact. But that is very unlikely if I fight a Heroic Spirit of similar strength.[lr]::
78056::$$$message_0725_0011_0001$$$::To use your terms, I spent fifty points in my skirmish with Lancer, and two hundred fighting Berserker."::
78057::$$$message_0725_0012_0000$$$::Lancer stabbed her in the chest, and Berserker tore her stomach open.[lr]::
78058::$$$message_0725_0012_0001$$$::Recovering from that much damage clearly took a lot of magical energy.[lr]::
78059::$$$message_0725_0012_0002$$$::Or so I thought, but...::
78060::$$$message_0725_0013_0000$$$::"It doesn't take much energy to heal my physical body. In fact, it costs more to restore my damaged armor. Most of my magical energy is dedicated to my defenses."::
78061::$$$message_0725_0014_0000$$$::...is how it is, apparently.::
78062::$$$message_0725_0015_0000$$$::"So the armor's like a part of your body. It takes energy to maintain them both, and you take it off to conserve energy."::
78063::$$$message_0725_0016_0000$$$::"Yes. But other Servants have no such requirements. Unlike Lancer or Archer who can assume spirit form outside of combat to reduce the burden on their Masters, I can only dispel my armor."[lr]::
78064::$$$message_0725_0016_0001$$$::"I see, makes sense... Oh, I think that's enough ingredients."::
78065::$$$message_0725_0017_0000$$$::"Shirou, I appreciate you cooking our meals, but shouldn't you be taking this more seriously?"[lr]::
78066::$$$message_0725_0017_0001$$$::"Huh? I am, though."::
78067::$$$message_0725_0018_0000$$$::Okay, not entirely, but I don't exactly feel like I'm in danger at this very moment.[lr]::
78068::$$$message_0725_0018_0001$$$::I was surprised to hear Saber's condition after we came home and had our strategy meeting.[lr]::
78069::$$$message_0725_0018_0002$$$::Without any extra magical energy from me, it takes all of Saber's power just to [font italic=true]exist[font italic=false].[lr]::
78070::$$$message_0725_0018_0003$$$::That doesn't sound like she's in any shape to fight at all, but when I brought it up...::
78071::$$$message_0725_0019_0000$$$::"Hey, Saber. Can I ask one more time how much magical energy you have right now?"[lr]::
78072::$$$message_0725_0019_0001$$$::"In your terms, about a thousand points."[lr]::
78073::$$$message_0725_0019_0002$$$::   Well, that's just crazy.::
78074::$$$message_0725_0020_0000$$$::She still has that much in the tank, even after spending two hundred on Berserker.[lr]::
78075::$$$message_0725_0020_0001$$$::And that's Saber on a [font italic=true]bad[font italic=false] day. It terrifies me to imagine how much power she might have with a proper mage backing her up.[lr]::
78076::$$$message_0725_0020_0002$$$::Clearly, it would be a number beyond imagination. It'd be stupid to even ask how many multiples of me that would be.[lr]::
78077::$$$message_0725_0020_0003$$$::I think I'm finally starting to understand why Tohsaka calls Saber the best Servant.::
78078::$$$message_0725_0021_0000$$$::"...That makes me feel a little better. There's only six enemies to fight, so you seem to have plenty of fuel for now."::
78079::$$$message_0725_0022_0000$$$::"That is only if I limit myself to regular combat.[lr]::
78080::$$$message_0725_0022_0001$$$::As I said, my Noble Phantasm requires an enormous amount of magical energy. It would be quite difficult to use it in this state. That is why I should try to conserve energy whenever possible."::
78081::$$$message_0725_0023_0000$$$::Saber's upset.[lr]::
78082::$$$message_0725_0023_0001$$$::I'm not sure if it's because her incompetent Master is a burden to her,[lr]::
78083::$$$message_0725_0023_0002$$$::or if it's because I'm not letting her get a good night's rest.::
78084::$$$message_0725_0024_0000$$$::"I know you need to save energy, but meals are important, too. I still have some leftovers from lunch, so let me fix you dinner. You can go to bed after that."::
78085::$$$message_0725_0025_0000$$$::"...[say storage=sak0408_sav_0090]Very well. I don't intend to use my Noble Phantasm on a whim, at any rate. We'll revisit this topic once you have a better understanding of what Servants are."[lr]::
78086::$$$message_0725_0025_0001$$$::Looking a little displeased, Saber politely takes a seat at the dining table, her posture perfect.::
78087::$$$message_0725_0026_0000$$$::Good, good.[lr]::
78088::$$$message_0725_0026_0001$$$::I'm glad she's willing to hear me out.[lr]::
78089::$$$message_0725_0026_0002$$$::Anyway, that's enough about our magical energy problem for tonight.[lr]::
78090::$$$message_0725_0026_0003$$$::It isn't something we have a solution for, so the next step is to get a firm grasp on our situation.[lr]::
78091::$$$message_0725_0026_0004$$$::And...::
78092::$$$message_0725_0027_0000$$$::"But Shirou...[lr]::
78093::$$$message_0725_0027_0001$$$::You said there were two problems. What is the other one?"[lr]::
78094::$$$message_0725_0027_0002$$$::"Hm? Oh, it'll be here any second now. Make sure you use the cover story we talked about."[lr]::
78095::$$$message_0725_0027_0003$$$::I start chopping daikon radishes and throw them into the wok.::
78096::$$$message_0725_0028_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
78097::$$$message_0725_0028_0001$$$::Saber tilts her head quizzically.[lr]::
78098::$$$message_0725_0028_0002$$$::And then,[lr]::
78099::$$$message_0725_0028_0003$$$::"We're back! Shirou, are you making dinner!?"[lr]::
78100::$$$message_0725_0028_0004$$$::"Thanks for having me over, Senpai."[lr]::
78101::$$$message_0725_0028_0005$$$::A pair of familiar voices ring out from the house entrance.::
78102::$$$message_0725_0029_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
78103::$$$message_0725_0029_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
78104::$$$message_0725_0029_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
78105::$$$message_0725_0029_0003$$$::The silence is painful.[lr]::
78106::$$$message_0725_0029_0004$$$::As I expected, Fuji-nee and Sakura take one look at Saber and then fix me with a laser-hot glare.::
78107::$$$message_0725_0030_0000$$$::"This is Saber. She'll be staying over starting today. Please be nice."[r][wsay canskip=1]::
78108::$$$message_0725_0030_0001$$$::That's all the explanation I give.::
78109::$$$message_0725_0031_0000$$$::Nobody objects, which makes the silence feel that much more pointed.[lr]::
78110::$$$message_0725_0031_0001$$$::They don't even drink the tea to avoid making a sipping sound, leaving the hot tea to go cold.[lr]::
78111::$$$message_0725_0031_0002$$$::But we'll never get anywhere at this rate.[lr]::
78112::$$$message_0725_0031_0003$$$::I'll just need to screw up my courage and press on.::
78113::$$$message_0725_0032_0000$$$::"Anyway, she came to see my old man. I can't just send her home. She's just taking the time for a little tourism and won't be staying that long, and we can have her stay in one of the open rooms."::
78114::$$$message_0725_0033_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
78115::$$$message_0725_0033_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
78116::$$$message_0725_0033_0002$$$::"..."::
78117::$$$message_0725_0034_0000$$$::...The quiet stretches on.[lr]::
78118::$$$message_0725_0034_0001$$$::By the way...[lr]::
78119::$$$message_0725_0034_0002$$$::I can understand Fuji-nee and Sakura's reaction, but why does Saber look so surprised?::
78120::$$$message_0725_0035_0000$$$::"Whew. Well, if she knows Kiritsugu, then we'll just have to let her stay. He did mention he had some relatives abroad. Um, Ms. Saber? Looks well-behaved, so I guess I can't say no."::
78121::$$$message_0725_0036_0000$$$::"Um... Ms. Fujimura? You mean..."[lr]::
78122::$$$message_0725_0036_0001$$$::"Sorry. I know how you feel, Sakura, but this is Kiritsugu's house. She came from abroad looking for her relative, so it would shame the reputation of Japanese hospitality if we turned her away. Plus, it's dangerous outside lately, and we can't kick out such an adorable girl."::
78123::$$$message_0725_0037_0000$$$::"...That's true. Do you agree, Senpai?"[lr]::
78124::$$$message_0725_0037_0001$$$::"Yeah, I do. I'm going to let Saber stay here for the time being. Do you have a problem with that, Sakura?"[lr]::
78125::$$$message_0725_0037_0002$$$::"...No, I think you should let your acquaintance stay over. But...um, Saber?"::
78126::$$$message_0725_0038_0000$$$::"Hm? Oh, yeah. Her name sounds kinda strange, but I guarantee that she's good people. She might act a little weird because she isn't used to Japan yet, but I'd appreciate it if you'd help her out."::
78127::$$$message_0725_0039_0000$$$::"...All right. If you say so, Senpai."[lr]::
78128::$$$message_0725_0039_0001$$$::Sakura nods meekly, not meeting Saber's eyes.[lr]::
78129::$$$message_0725_0039_0002$$$::Does she not like Saber because she's a foreigner?::
78130::$$$message_0725_0040_0000$$$::Anyway, it's time for dinner.[lr]::
78131::$$$message_0725_0040_0001$$$::I put a lot of effort into dinner to make up for lunch, and because it's Saber's welcome meal.::
78132::$$$message_0725_0041_0000$$$::The meal begins with a tuna tataki salad and fried chicken with a mildly spicy scallion sauce. It's followed by a somewhat standard main course of beef and potato stew, accompanied by an assortment of deep-fried tempura featuring fluffy shrimp.::
78133::$$$message_0725_0042_0000$$$::It's definitely a splurge without any clear program to the menu, but...[lr]::
78134::$$$message_0725_0042_0001$$$::It seems poorly received by both the guest of honor and my apprentice.::
78135::$$$message_0725_0043_0000$$$::"Wow, what's up with this tempura! It isn't just soft and yummy on the inside! I think you might've just changed my whole outlook on shrimp, Shirou!"::
78136::$$$message_0725_0044_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
78137::$$$message_0725_0044_0001$$$::Well, uh...[lr]::
78138::$$$message_0725_0044_0002$$$::On the other hand, Fuji-nee enjoys the meal enough for the four of us.::
78139::$$$message_0725_0045_0000$$$::Thanks to her good humor, dinner ends without incident.[lr]::
78140::$$$message_0725_0045_0001$$$::I even got to see Fuji-nee offer Saber some of her own food, which isn't common at all.[lr]::
78141::$$$message_0725_0045_0002$$$::She seems to have taken a shine to our taciturn houseguest, which is something I ought to have seen coming.::
78142::$$$message_0725_0046_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
78143::$$$message_0725_0046_0001$$$::Fuji-nee leads Saber off to prep her bedroom in the guest house.[lr]::
78144::$$$message_0725_0046_0002$$$::Sakura and I stay behind to clean up after dinner.[lr]::
78145::$$$message_0725_0046_0003$$$::We divide up the tasks as usual.::
78146::$$$message_0725_0047_0000$$$::"I'll do the dishes. Sakura, would you mind cleaning up the table?[lr]::
78147::$$$message_0725_0047_0001$$$::Oh, and don't throw the frying oil away yet. Just cover it and put it in the back. Do you need help? It's heavy."[lr]::
78148::$$$message_0725_0047_0002$$$::"Huh...? Oh, I can carry it. I'm stronger than I look, you know."::
78149::$$$message_0725_0048_0000$$$::She picks up the pot with a small huff of exertion.[lr]::
78150::$$$message_0725_0048_0001$$$::She can pull a bowstring, after all, so I shouldn't have worried.[lr]::
78151::$$$message_0725_0048_0002$$$::"Though there's more to archery than pulling a bowstring..."[lr]::
78152::$$$message_0725_0048_0003$$$::I wash the dishes to the sound of splashing water.::
78153::$$$message_0725_0049_0000$$$::Then...[lr]::
78154::$$$message_0725_0049_0001$$$::"Huh? Senpai, we're short a few towels. We're out of paper towels too, and some of the dishes aren't in their usual place."[lr]::
78155::$$$message_0725_0049_0002$$$::"Eh? Let's see... Oh, you're right. I wonder if a thief got in."::
78156::$$$message_0725_0050_0000$$$::"Hmm...I doubt there are any burglars who only take kitchen rags."[lr]::
78157::$$$message_0725_0050_0001$$$::"Right? What kind of thief does that?"::
78158::$$$message_0725_0051_0000$$$::Dishes not in their proper place.[lr]::
78159::$$$message_0725_0051_0001$$$::An empty paper towel roll.[lr]::
78160::$$$message_0725_0051_0002$$$::Several missing kitchen towels.[lr]::
78161::$$$message_0725_0051_0003$$$::Finally, the dots connect in my head.::
78162::$$$message_0725_0051_0004$$$::"Ah, right. Tohsaka was here."[lr]::
78163::$$$message_0725_0051_0005$$$::I slapped my fist into my palm in realization.::
78164::$$$message_0725_0052_0000$$$::Tohsaka took care of me after I collapsed during the Berserker fight.[lr]::
78165::$$$message_0725_0052_0001$$$::She must have used whatever linens were on hand to treat me.::
78166::$$$message_0725_0053_0000$$$::"Senpai, by Tohsaka, you mean...from school?"[lr]::
78167::$$$message_0725_0053_0001$$$::"Yeah. She stopped by the other day.[lr]::
78168::$$$message_0725_0053_0002$$$::Um, I was stupid and got myself hurt. Tohsaka was passing by and was kind enough to give me first aid. She really is the gracious star student of our school, huh."::
78169::$$$message_0725_0054_0000$$$::Of course, I didn't mean the last half of that at all.[lr]::
78170::$$$message_0725_0054_0001$$$::Whatever fantasies I had of Tohsaka died last night.[lr]::
78171::$$$message_0725_0054_0002$$$::To my deep regret, Rin Tohsaka, the star student and idol of my high school life, was wiped away yesterday. Damn it.::
78172::$$$message_0725_0055_0000$$$::"...Why?"[lr]::
78173::$$$message_0725_0055_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
78174::$$$message_0725_0055_0002$$$::"Why was she here? It's a little strange. She has nothing to do with us. Not me, or you, so why?"::
78175::$$$message_0725_0056_0000$$$::Sakura suddenly goes still, looking downcast.[lr]::
78176::$$$message_0725_0056_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
78177::$$$message_0725_0056_0002$$$::It's so sudden, I don't know what to say.[lr]::
78178::$$$message_0725_0056_0003$$$::She's hugging herself, as if she's trying to hold in some anxiety.::
