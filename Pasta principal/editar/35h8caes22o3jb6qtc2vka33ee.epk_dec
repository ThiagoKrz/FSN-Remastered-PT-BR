67235::$$$message_0626_0000_0001$$$::   And then,[lr]::
67236::$$$message_0626_0000_0002$$$::Kotomine jumps through the broken window, his coat fluttering.::
67237::$$$message_0626_0001_0000$$$::"Kotomine!?"[lr]::
67238::$$$message_0626_0001_0001$$$::Illya lets go of my hand and squares off against Kotomine.::
67239::$$$message_0626_0002_0000$$$::"Illya, wait! He's on our side. I brought him in as a last-minute ally, just this once."[lr]::
67240::$$$message_0626_0002_0001$$$::"Huh!? No way, you're working with a man like him!? You can't, Shirou. He's[line2]"[lr]::
67241::$$$message_0626_0002_0002$$$::"The idle chat can wait. We need to leave before they catch us."[lr]::
67242::$$$message_0626_0002_0003$$$::"Eh? Kyaah!?"::
67243::$$$message_0626_0003_0000$$$::   Kotomine moves in a flash.[lr]::
67244::$$$message_0626_0003_0001$$$::Before I can react, he scoops up Illya in his arms and dives out the window.::
67245::$$$message_0626_0004_0000$$$::"Wha... Illya!!!"[lr]::
67246::$$$message_0626_0004_0001$$$::I panic and run to the window.::
67247::$$$message_0626_0005_0000$$$::...Kotomine's just landed on the ground.[lr]::
67248::$$$message_0626_0005_0001$$$::As soon as he touches down, Illya wildly waves her arms[lr]::
67249::$$$message_0626_0005_0002$$$::and slaps him across the face.[lr]::
67250::$$$message_0626_0005_0003$$$::...It's a pleasant sound that I can hear from up here.::
67251::$$$message_0626_0006_0000$$$::"Wait, what am I so impressed about? He's basically telling me to jump!"[lr]::
67252::$$$message_0626_0006_0001$$$::There's no time to doubt myself.[lr]::
67253::$$$message_0626_0006_0002$$$::If I can pull off the landing, I'll survive somehow.::
67254::$$$message_0626_0007_0000$$$::"Whew."[lr]::
67255::$$$message_0626_0007_0001$$$::I charge my legs with as much magical energy as I can manage.[lr]::
67256::$$$message_0626_0007_0002$$$::I can't magically Strengthen my own body, but it should lessen the impact...::
67257::$$$message_0626_0008_0000$$$::                                             ...NOPE, BAD IDEA!!!::
67258::$$$message_0626_0008_0001$$$::"Uuuurrrrrgh!!!"[lr]::
67259::$$$message_0626_0008_0002$$$::I jump from over twenty meters high and drop into a roll when I land.[lr]::
67260::$$$message_0626_0008_0003$$$::Three stories doesn't sound like much, until you consider how tall this castle is.[lr]::
67261::$$$message_0626_0008_0004$$$::It would have easily been eight stories in a Japanese apartment building.::
67262::$$$message_0626_0009_0000$$$::"That smarts... I thought I was gonna land on my head."[lr]::
67263::$$$message_0626_0009_0001$$$::...Damn it. My legs are too numb to stand up.[lr]::
67264::$$$message_0626_0009_0002$$$::Luckily, I landed on grass.[lr]::
67265::$$$message_0626_0009_0003$$$::If this had been asphalt, my bones would have broken out of my legs, and then I wouldn't be able to get out of here.::
67266::$$$message_0626_0010_0000$$$::"Wow. You're sturdy, Shirou."[lr]::
67267::$$$message_0626_0010_0001$$$::"Indeed. I'm amazed you managed to jump from that height without using any magecraft... Have you given up on life?"[lr]::
67268::$$$message_0626_0010_0002$$$::Both of them are staring at me.[lr]::
67269::$$$message_0626_0010_0003$$$::Illya aside, Kotomine's words nearly make me forget about my numb legs.::
67270::$$$message_0626_0011_0000$$$::"Like hell I am! That was all I could do to follow you when you jumped! I'm never doing that again. I could've broken my legs, and I almost passed out as soon as I jumped!"::
67271::$$$message_0626_0012_0000$$$::"And yet you're no worse for wear. I suppose it's nothing to complain about...but it is quite a surprise. I didn't expect you to jump from that high.[lr]::
67272::$$$message_0626_0012_0001$$$::No mage would attempt such a feat without using magecraft."::
67273::$$$message_0626_0013_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
67274::$$$message_0626_0013_0001$$$::I mean, they left me behind. I couldn't let Kotomine show me up after he jumped out there with Illya...::
67275::$$$message_0626_0014_0000$$$::"It's not your fault, Shirou. Archer is influencing your mind as well as your body.[lr]::
67276::$$$message_0626_0014_0001$$$::That's why you're getting tougher and why you thought that you'd be fine dropping from that height. You're starting to think like Archer."::
67277::$$$message_0626_0015_0000$$$::"...Huh? Illya, what do you mean?"[lr]::
67278::$$$message_0626_0015_0001$$$::"I see. That is reassuring. Do maintain that vigor in battle. Here, your sword."[lr]::
67279::$$$message_0626_0015_0002$$$::He tosses me the weapon I left behind when I started climbing.::
67280::$$$message_0626_0016_0000$$$::"Whoa..."[lr]::
67281::$$$message_0626_0016_0001$$$::"Can you run? Your life depends on it."[lr]::
67282::$$$message_0626_0016_0002$$$::Kotomine says that we don't have time to stand around talking, and makes for the castle gate.[lr]::
67283::$$$message_0626_0016_0003$$$::Then, as if issuing a challenge...[lr]::
67284::$$$message_0626_0016_0004$$$::"[wacky len=14]"[lr]::
67285::$$$message_0626_0016_0005$$$::A different sound shakes the wintry castle.::
67286::$$$message_0626_0017_0000$$$::"...I knew it. Sakura kept him in this world."[lr]::
67287::$$$message_0626_0017_0001$$$::...It's unmistakably the roar of a predator.[lr]::
67288::$$$message_0626_0017_0002$$$::It signals that a beast is on the hunt.[lr]::
67289::$$$message_0626_0017_0003$$$::It is a death sentence handed down to the lost prisoners by the kind and merciless lord of the castle.::
67290::$$$message_0626_0018_0000$$$::"...Berserker."[lr]::
67291::$$$message_0626_0018_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67292::$$$message_0626_0018_0002$$$::My mind switches over to battle mode.[lr]::
67293::$$$message_0626_0018_0003$$$::Berserker, he said.[lr]::
67294::$$$message_0626_0018_0004$$$::The name invokes the image of a threat that once[line2]that still threatens me. It squeezes the calm out of every last cell in my body.::
67295::$$$message_0626_0019_0000$$$::"Kotomine."[lr]::
67296::$$$message_0626_0019_0001$$$::"We're leaving. That is not an opponent we can fight. We will only die if it catches up to us."[lr]::
67297::$$$message_0626_0019_0002$$$::Kotomine runs ahead to the gate.::
67298::$$$message_0626_0020_0000$$$::"Don't look back, Illya! Leave him, he's not who he used to be!"::
67299::$$$message_0626_0021_0000$$$::I take Illya's hand and start running.[lr]::
67300::$$$message_0626_0021_0001$$$::   I can't afford to save my stamina anymore.[lr]::
67301::$$$message_0626_0021_0002$$$::If that mad warrior is the one pursuing us, then the only way to survive is to run as fast as we can for the three hours it takes to reach the edge of the forest...!::
67302::$$$message_0626_0022_0000$$$::My breath catches in my throat.[lr]::
67303::$$$message_0626_0022_0001$$$::We're being overtaken by a darkness I can't ignore, no matter where I look.::
67304::$$$message_0626_0023_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
67305::$$$message_0626_0023_0001$$$::We run through the forest.[lr]::
67306::$$$message_0626_0023_0002$$$::I can't see anyone behind us yet.[lr]::
67307::$$$message_0626_0023_0003$$$::All I hear is the wind gusting by.[lr]::
67308::$$$message_0626_0023_0004$$$::Our pursuer is a titanic beast, not a hound.[lr]::
67309::$$$message_0626_0023_0005$$$::While we have to dodge between the trunks and branches, it closes in on us while tearing apart everything in its path.::
67310::$$$message_0626_0024_0000$$$::...You'd think we were being chased by a giant drilling rig, boring its way through the forest.[lr]::
67311::$$$message_0626_0024_0001$$$::The jet-black wall slowly accelerates, threatening to close in around us.::
67312::$$$message_0626_0025_0000$$$::"Ah... Hahh, hah... I...I can't run that fast!"[lr]::
67313::$$$message_0626_0025_0001$$$::"Nngh."::
67314::$$$message_0626_0026_0000$$$::I slow my pace to match Illya's.[lr]::
67315::$$$message_0626_0026_0001$$$::...This is bad.[lr]::
67316::$$$message_0626_0026_0002$$$::The hostile wall is about as fast as me.[lr]::
67317::$$$message_0626_0026_0003$$$::If I have to run while carrying Illya, it'll definitely catch up to us within a minute!::
67318::$$$message_0626_0027_0000$$$::"I can't do this! Just leave me and go, Shirou!"[lr]::
67319::$$$message_0626_0027_0001$$$::"It hasn't caught up to us yet! Get on my back! I can handle it!"[lr]::
67320::$$$message_0626_0027_0002$$$::"No you can't, stupid! You know it'll catch up if you carry me...!"::
67321::$$$message_0626_0028_0000$$$::"Kuh..."[lr]::
67322::$$$message_0626_0028_0001$$$::What should I do?[lr]::
67323::$$$message_0626_0028_0002$$$::Should I keep running with Illya, or...[lr]::
67324::$$$message_0626_0028_0003$$$::...or, should I fight that monster?[lr]::
67325::$$$message_0626_0028_0004$$$::I couldn't even defend myself against Assassin.[lr]::
67326::$$$message_0626_0028_0005$$$::Could I possibly go toe-to-toe with that monster, the strongest Servant, with nothing more than a borrowed thin sword?::
67327::$$$message_0626_0029_0000$$$::"Ngh, argh..."[lr]::
67328::$$$message_0626_0029_0001$$$::I can't.[lr]::
67329::$$$message_0626_0029_0002$$$::Stop.[lr]::
67330::$$$message_0626_0029_0003$$$::Gimme a break.[lr]::
67331::$$$message_0626_0029_0004$$$::There's absolutely nothing I can do to beat that monster!::
67332::$$$message_0626_0030_0000$$$::If I stop, I'm dead.[lr]::
67333::$$$message_0626_0030_0001$$$::I'll be killed for sure.[lr]::
67334::$$$message_0626_0030_0002$$$::If I face the monster, it'll chop my feeble body in half, and it'll stomp my still-conscious torso to smithereens like an industrial grinder...::
67335::$$$message_0626_0031_0000$$$::"There's no need for that. I will carry Illyasviel."[lr]::
67336::$$$message_0626_0031_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
67337::$$$message_0626_0031_0002$$$::Illya and I turn around.[lr]::
67338::$$$message_0626_0031_0003$$$::   We don't have time to stay surprised.[lr]::
67339::$$$message_0626_0031_0004$$$::Kotomine comes all the way back to us and picks up Illya in his arms without further ado.::
67340::$$$message_0626_0032_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
67341::$$$message_0626_0032_0001$$$::He's fast...![lr]::
67342::$$$message_0626_0032_0002$$$::Kotomine must be in great shape.[lr]::
67343::$$$message_0626_0032_0003$$$::With his height, he should be able to easily run while carrying Illya.::
67344::$$$message_0626_0033_0000$$$::But we're in the middle of a forest.[lr]::
67345::$$$message_0626_0033_0001$$$::With both arms occupied by his charge, he navigates the uneven terrain and thick trees without slowing down at all!::
67346::$$$message_0626_0034_0000$$$::"Kotomine...!"[lr]::
67347::$$$message_0626_0034_0001$$$::I run after him as fast as I can.[lr]::
67348::$$$message_0626_0034_0002$$$::I keep up with him.[lr]::
67349::$$$message_0626_0034_0003$$$::Unshackled, I run next to Kotomine, who's carrying Illya.[lr]::
67350::$$$message_0626_0034_0004$$$::I manage to cover a hundred meters in seven seconds, in this forest that's so easy to trip on.::
67351::$$$message_0626_0035_0000$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
67352::$$$message_0626_0035_0001$$$::My heart beats at a rapid cadence.[lr]::
67353::$$$message_0626_0035_0002$$$::Something's wrong.[lr]::
67354::$$$message_0626_0035_0003$$$::I'm running too fast.[lr]::
67355::$$$message_0626_0035_0004$$$::No human can run through a forest at nearly 50 kilometers per hour.::
67356::$$$message_0626_0036_0000$$$::My legs throb.[lr]::
67357::$$$message_0626_0036_0001$$$::My wrapped left arm feels odd, like it's swollen.::
67358::$$$message_0626_0037_0000$$$::...This must be what Illya was talking about. Archer's physical functions are taking over Shirou Emiya, not just his combat experience.[lr]::
67359::$$$message_0626_0037_0001$$$::It's a radically potent muscle-enhancing drug.[lr]::
67360::$$$message_0626_0037_0002$$$::The poison is injected into my body, giving me powers beyond my own.::
67361::$$$message_0626_0038_0000$$$::    That's good.[lr]::
67362::$$$message_0626_0038_0001$$$::Even if it's like shaking a Geiger counter to try and make it not detect a radiation leak, I appreciate it right now.::
67363::$$$message_0626_0039_0000$$$::But not Kotomine.[lr]::
67364::$$$message_0626_0039_0001$$$::He's not showing any signs of magical energy output or magecraft usage.[lr]::
67365::$$$message_0626_0039_0002$$$::It's hard to believe, but he's sprinting while carrying Illya, without the aid of any magecraft at all!::
67366::$$$message_0626_0040_0000$$$::"Hey, are you actually human!?"[lr]::
67367::$$$message_0626_0040_0001$$$::"I'm not as far gone as you. Have you noticed, though? If we maintain this pace, we can escape. It appears that thing is blind."::
67368::$$$message_0626_0041_0000$$$::"You mean he can't see us?!"[lr]::
67369::$$$message_0626_0041_0001$$$::"That's the only possible conclusion.[lr]::
67370::$$$message_0626_0041_0002$$$::He is faster than us. The forest trees are but pebbles in Berserker's path. If he still hasn't caught us, it must be a flaw on his part."::
67371::$$$message_0626_0042_0000$$$::Kotomine explains calmly.[lr]::
67372::$$$message_0626_0042_0001$$$::It bothers me that he can look so bored talking about something that should have us jumping for joy, but that means...::
67373::$$$message_0626_0043_0000$$$::"...We can get away. So it's just up to our stamina!?"[lr]::
67374::$$$message_0626_0043_0001$$$::"No. They aren't soft enough to let us slip from their grasp."::
67375::$$$message_0626_0044_0000$$$::His voice drips with hostility.[lr]::
67376::$$$message_0626_0044_0001$$$::Before I understand what he means...[lr]::
67377::$$$message_0626_0044_0002$$$::"Assassin!"[lr]::
67378::$$$message_0626_0044_0003$$$::My left arm twitches.::
67379::$$$message_0626_0045_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
67380::$$$message_0626_0045_0001$$$::I see a white skull.[lr]::
67381::$$$message_0626_0045_0002$$$::Like a rapid slideshow, Assassin flits in and out of the trees on a path parallel to ours, seemingly mocking our escape...!::
67382::$$$message_0626_0046_0000$$$::"Wait..."[lr]::
67383::$$$message_0626_0046_0001$$$::By the time I notice it, it's too late.[lr]::
67384::$$$message_0626_0046_0002$$$::Assassin makes a subtle wave of his arm as he slips in and out of the trees at high speed, and[line2][lr]::
67385::$$$message_0626_0046_0003$$$::"!?"[lr]::
67386::$$$message_0626_0046_0004$$$::Someone blocks the attack before it can skewer me between the eyes.::
67387::$$$message_0626_0047_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67388::$$$message_0626_0047_0001$$$::I gasp.[lr]::
67389::$$$message_0626_0047_0002$$$::Only one person could have done that.[lr]::
67390::$$$message_0626_0047_0003$$$::Kotomine deflected a throw that I couldn't even see, all while carrying Illya...!::
67391::$$$message_0626_0048_0000$$$::"What a nuisance. He never shows up when we're idle, but comes uninvited whenever we're busy."[lr]::
67392::$$$message_0626_0048_0001$$$::Kotomine slows his speed.[lr]::
67393::$$$message_0626_0048_0002$$$::The priest frowns with displeasure, watching the dark killer keeping pace with us.::
67394::$$$message_0626_0049_0000$$$::"Kotomine?"[lr]::
67395::$$$message_0626_0049_0001$$$::"Take Illya. I will deal with this.[lr]::
67396::$$$message_0626_0049_0002$$$::After all, exorcising demons is a familiar part of my priestly duties."[lr]::
67397::$$$message_0626_0049_0003$$$::Kotomine stops and lets Illya down.::
67398::$$$message_0626_0050_0000$$$::"Wha... Are you serious!?"[lr]::
67399::$$$message_0626_0050_0001$$$::Illya's bewildered. I take her hand and pull her close.[lr]::
67400::$$$message_0626_0050_0002$$$::At the same time, three daggers fly at us like bullets...![lr]::
67401::$$$message_0626_0050_0003$$$::"Kotomine!"::
67402::$$$message_0626_0051_0000$$$::"Sharp, but too honest. For one who calls himself a lord of the mountain, you're so easy to read."[lr]::
67403::$$$message_0626_0051_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67404::$$$message_0626_0051_0002$$$::I'm having trouble believing it, to be honest.[lr]::
67405::$$$message_0626_0051_0003$$$::Assassin let fly three flashes of lightning.[lr]::
67406::$$$message_0626_0051_0004$$$::And the priest parried them all without breaking a sweat!::
67407::$$$message_0626_0052_0000$$$::"[wacky len=12][line4]"::
67408::$$$message_0626_0053_0000$$$::"!"[lr]::
67409::$$$message_0626_0053_0001$$$::Berserker![lr]::
67410::$$$message_0626_0053_0002$$$::Damn, that one was close. He'll definitely catch up if we get stalled here...!::
67411::$$$message_0626_0054_0000$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
67412::$$$message_0626_0054_0001$$$::I can't stop now.[lr]::
67413::$$$message_0626_0054_0002$$$::I need to take Illya and get out of here!::
67414::$$$message_0626_0055_0000$$$::"We can go, right, Kotomine!?"[lr]::
67415::$$$message_0626_0055_0001$$$::"That's what I said. You need not concern yourself with me."[lr]::
67416::$$$message_0626_0055_0002$$$::I pick Illya up.[lr]::
67417::$$$message_0626_0055_0003$$$::I can't go as fast as Kotomine, but this should be faster than holding her hand while running...::
67418::$$$message_0626_0056_0000$$$::I leave the priest behind.[lr]::
67419::$$$message_0626_0056_0001$$$::The dark roars are on the other side of the forest.[lr]::
67420::$$$message_0626_0056_0002$$$::It's wreaking destruction in a seemingly wild pattern to smoke us out, but closing in on us all the same.::
67421::$$$message_0626_0057_0000$$$::I don't have anything to say to Kotomine.[lr]::

67427::$$$message_0626_0059_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
67428::$$$message_0626_0059_0001$$$::"A needless warning. Hurry. You should be able to escape Berserker. The rest of this war depends on you, Shirou Emiya."[lr]::

67430::$$$message_0626_0059_0003$$$::I nod and start running.::
67431::$$$message_0626_0060_0000$$$::   Two shadows shrink into the distance.[lr]::
67432::$$$message_0626_0060_0001$$$::When I look back one last time, his back is so far away.[lr]::
67433::$$$message_0626_0060_0002$$$::...I have an ominous feeling.[lr]::
67434::$$$message_0626_0060_0003$$$::I don't think we'll see each other alive ever again.::
