11991::$$$message_0119_0000_0001$$$::There's no time for me to hesitate.[lr]::
11992::$$$message_0119_0000_0002$$$::I can't possibly fight like this, so I need to be careful until I've recovered.::
11993::$$$message_0119_0001_0000$$$::"Hmph...there!"[lr]::
11994::$$$message_0119_0001_0001$$$::I put my wrists together to make it look like I'm tied up.::
11995::$$$message_0119_0002_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
11996::$$$message_0119_0002_0001$$$::The door opens.[lr]::
11997::$$$message_0119_0002_0002$$$::Could it be Illya? Or someone else from the castle?[lr]::
11998::$$$message_0119_0002_0003$$$::I just need to remain sitting here, looking like I'm bound up, right up to the very last moment when the person comes into the room and[line2]::
11999::$$$message_0119_0003_0000$$$::"Are you all right, Shirou!?"[lr]::

12001::$$$message_0119_0003_0002$$$::My eyes widen.[lr]::
12002::$$$message_0119_0003_0003$$$::For a moment, I genuinely think I'm just hallucinating out of sheer, desperate hope.::
12003::$$$message_0119_0004_0000$$$::"I see you are tied up.[lr]::
12004::$$$message_0119_0004_0001$$$::I will untie you, so please stay[line2]"[lr]::
12005::$$$message_0119_0004_0002$$$::"Oh, uh...the ropes are loose."[lr]::
12006::$$$message_0119_0004_0003$$$::I bring my hands out front.::
12007::$$$message_0119_0005_0000$$$::"I do not understand. Were you not held captive here?"::
12008::$$$message_0119_0006_0000$$$::"Well, uh...I kind of got free, and then I heard someone coming as I was trying to get away, so I pretended to still be tied up."::
12009::$$$message_0119_0007_0000$$$::"I see. You were trying to trick your enemy into lowering their guard to give yourself the best possible chance of escape."[lr]::
12010::$$$message_0119_0007_0001$$$::Saber looks impressed.[lr]::
12011::$$$message_0119_0007_0002$$$::I am...not going to tell her that I hadn't managed to think any farther than that.::
12012::$$$message_0119_0008_0000$$$::"By the way...you're Saber, right!? You're not some illusion. You're the REAL Saber?"[lr]::
12013::$$$message_0119_0008_0001$$$::I stand up and touch Saber.::
12014::$$$message_0119_0009_0000$$$::"Oh!? S-Shirou, please stop. If you touch me like that..."[lr]::
12015::$$$message_0119_0009_0001$$$::"Yep, you're real...b-but how did you get here!?"::
12016::$$$message_0119_0010_0000$$$::"Wh-why? I should hardly need to tell you. Servants need not explain their need to protect their Masters. It is my duty to come to your aid, knowing you have been captured."::
12017::$$$message_0119_0011_0000$$$::"Uh...well... But how did you know I got captured? Or actually, why are you here, Saber? This is Illya's hideout. You shouldn't be coming anywhere near here right now."‰'œ
