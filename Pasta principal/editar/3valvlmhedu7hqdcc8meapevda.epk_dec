74951::$$$message_0689_0000_0001$$$::...I open my eyes.[lr]::
74952::$$$message_0689_0000_0002$$$::I stick my arm up in the air for no real reason, stare at the ceiling, then let it fall on the futon.::
74953::$$$message_0689_0001_0000$$$::"Feels kinda...heavy."[lr]::
74954::$$$message_0689_0001_0001$$$::I keep gazing absently at the ceiling without getting up.[lr]::
74955::$$$message_0689_0001_0002$$$::It feels like my whole body is slow.[lr]::
74956::$$$message_0689_0001_0003$$$::My head is in a daze and my body wants rest.[lr]::
74957::$$$message_0689_0001_0004$$$::That must be why I don't feel like getting up, even though it's already morning.::
74958::$$$message_0689_0002_0000$$$::"Mm... Why am I so tired?"[lr]::
74959::$$$message_0689_0002_0001$$$::Maybe the fatigue has been building up.[lr]::
74960::$$$message_0689_0002_0002$$$::A lot happened yesterday, but I didn't go to bed particularly exhausted.[lr]::
74961::$$$message_0689_0002_0003$$$::I probably feel this way because I didn't sleep enough.::
74962::$$$message_0689_0003_0000$$$::"...Maybe I didn't sleep well. Eh, the blood will start flowing once I move around."[lr]::
74963::$$$message_0689_0003_0001$$$::Sakura's in much worse shape than I am, anyway.[lr]::
74964::$$$message_0689_0003_0002$$$::She's doing her best, so I can't let a little grogginess keep me down.::
74965::$$$message_0689_0004_0000$$$::I pump myself up for the day and get out of bed.[lr]::
74966::$$$message_0689_0004_0001$$$::"Urgh..."[lr]::
74967::$$$message_0689_0004_0002$$$::Then, the dizziness hits me again.[lr]::
74968::$$$message_0689_0004_0003$$$::It isn't from my body's slowness.[lr]::
74969::$$$message_0689_0004_0004$$$::It's like...as soon as I look at my bedroom door, I remember what happened last night all too vividly.::
74970::$$$message_0689_0005_0000$$$::"Um... I'd better change."[lr]::
74971::$$$message_0689_0005_0001$$$::...Oh, man.[lr]::
74972::$$$message_0689_0005_0002$$$::If this is already making me blush, how am I going to talk to Sakura today?::
74973::$$$message_0689_0006_0000$$$::"...All right, here goes."::
74974::$$$message_0689_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74975::$$$message_0689_0007_0001$$$::I'll be okay. I've already run this simulation a bunch of times.[lr]::
74976::$$$message_0689_0007_0002$$$::There's nothing difficult about it. It's just a "good morning" like always. What am I getting so worked up for?::
74977::$$$message_0689_0008_0000$$$::"Ah."[lr]::
74978::$$$message_0689_0008_0001$$$::But...[lr]::
74979::$$$message_0689_0008_0002$$$::I thought Sakura would be in the kitchen, but she's already putting breakfast on the table.::
74980::$$$message_0689_0009_0000$$$::"Ah... G-good morning, Senpai."[lr]::
74981::$$$message_0689_0009_0001$$$::"Uh. Yeah. Mor...ning. Sakura."::
74982::$$$message_0689_0010_0000$$$::"Um...uh."[lr]::
74983::$$$message_0689_0010_0001$$$::"Uhhh... well."[lr]::
74984::$$$message_0689_0010_0002$$$::I try to think of something clever to say, but draw a blank.::
74985::$$$message_0689_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74986::$$$message_0689_0011_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
74987::$$$message_0689_0012_0000$$$::"M-morning, Sakura! Breakfast looks really good!"[lr]::
74988::$$$message_0689_0012_0001$$$::How unimaginative, even for me.[lr]::
74989::$$$message_0689_0012_0002$$$::...Wait, I greeted her already! Idiot!::
74990::$$$message_0689_0013_0000$$$::"Uh, yes! G-good morning, Senpai!"[lr]::
74991::$$$message_0689_0013_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74992::$$$message_0689_0013_0002$$$::But...[lr]::
74993::$$$message_0689_0013_0003$$$::Somehow, Sakura's reply feels exactly the same, too.::
74994::$$$message_0689_0014_0000$$$::Her eyes go wide, as if she's realized the same thing.[lr]::
74995::$$$message_0689_0014_0001$$$::I must be making the same face.::
74996::$$$message_0689_0015_0000$$$::"Hah..."[lr]::
74997::$$$message_0689_0015_0001$$$::The thought makes me relax.[lr]::
74998::$$$message_0689_0015_0002$$$::We've both been nervously looking forward to seeing each other.::
74999::$$$message_0689_0016_0000$$$::"Whew. Good morning for the third time, Sakura."[lr]::
75000::$$$message_0689_0016_0001$$$::I feel myself smiling.[lr]::
75001::$$$message_0689_0016_0002$$$::This time, I say it with relief.[lr]::
75002::$$$message_0689_0016_0003$$$::"...Yes. Good morning, Senpai."::
75003::$$$message_0689_0017_0000$$$::Then, we awkwardly start eating breakfast.::
75004::$$$message_0689_0018_0000$$$::"Let's eat, then."[lr]::
75005::$$$message_0689_0018_0001$$$::"Yes, let's eat."[lr]::
75006::$$$message_0689_0018_0002$$$::Even though we try to carry on like we always do, I still can't stop feeling nervous.::
75007::$$$message_0689_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75008::$$$message_0689_0019_0001$$$::I move my chopsticks uneasily.[lr]::
75009::$$$message_0689_0019_0002$$$::Sakura eats cheerfully, like she's gotten used to it already.[lr]::
75010::$$$message_0689_0019_0003$$$::...Is this something that girls are better at?::
75011::$$$message_0689_0020_0000$$$::"Hm? What's wrong? Oh, would you like more miso soup?"[lr]::
75012::$$$message_0689_0020_0001$$$::"...No, I'm still on my first bowl. But it's good. Delicious, actually."[lr]::
75013::$$$message_0689_0020_0002$$$::"Yes, I'm confident in today's breakfast. I'm glad you like it."::
75014::$$$message_0689_0021_0000$$$::"Mm..."[lr]::
75015::$$$message_0689_0021_0001$$$::Her smile squeezes my heart.[lr]::
75016::$$$message_0689_0021_0002$$$::I'm still blushing while Sakura's calm, so I dig into my food to hide my embarrassment.…Óù$
