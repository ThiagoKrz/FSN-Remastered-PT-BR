11510::$$$message_0115_0000_0000$$$::Altria.[lr]::
11511::$$$message_0115_0000_0001$$$::That's the name she was given when she celebrated her coming of age.::
11512::$$$message_0115_0001_0000$$$::It was wartime.[lr]::
11513::$$$message_0115_0001_0001$$$::It began with the collapse of an empire.[lr]::
11514::$$$message_0115_0001_0002$$$::An empire that had been meant to be eternal was slowly waiting to die amid invasions from all sides.[lr]::
11515::$$$message_0115_0001_0003$$$::In preparation for the many wars, the empire deprived an island nation of its military.::
11516::$$$message_0115_0002_0000$$$::That is how it began.[lr]::
11517::$$$message_0115_0002_0001$$$::Having lost the empire's protection, her nation had no choice but to become independent, and over time, it broke up into smaller nations.::
11518::$$$message_0115_0003_0000$$$::The invasions came again and again.[lr]::
11519::$$$message_0115_0003_0001$$$::Internal conflicts between clans spiraled out of control.[lr]::
11520::$$$message_0115_0003_0002$$$::Then came a long period of war, which would later come to be known as the Dark Ages.[lr]::
11521::$$$message_0115_0003_0003$$$::It is during this difficult time that she was born, heir to the throne.::
11522::$$$message_0115_0004_0000$$$::A long, tumultuous period of war.[lr]::
11523::$$$message_0115_0004_0001$$$::The king believed in a mage's prophecy and so eagerly awaited the birth of his worthy successor.[lr]::
11524::$$$message_0115_0004_0002$$$::But the child born to him was not the child he desired.[lr]::
11525::$$$message_0115_0004_0003$$$::His child wasn't male.[lr]::
11526::$$$message_0115_0004_0004$$$::Fated king or not, the child could not assume the throne unless they were a boy.::
11527::$$$message_0115_0005_0000$$$::So the girl was entrusted to the king's retainer and was raised as a knight.[lr]::
11528::$$$message_0115_0005_0001$$$::The king was saddened, but the mage delighted.[lr]::
11529::$$$message_0115_0005_0002$$$::One's sex has nothing to do with one's worthiness to become king.[lr]::
11530::$$$message_0115_0005_0003$$$::More than that, the mage was convinced that the girl's absence from the castle until the day of the prophecy was proof she was the true king.::
11531::$$$message_0115_0006_0000$$$::So, she grew up under the care of a simple and wise old knight as his adopted child and successor.[lr]::
11532::$$$message_0115_0006_0001$$$::The old knight did not believe in the mage's prophecy.[lr]::
11533::$$$message_0115_0006_0002$$$::He simply raised her to be a knight, and hoped for her to continue growing, because he felt something from her that reminded him very much of his own lord.::
11534::$$$message_0115_0007_0000$$$::But even without the knight's encouragement or intervention, the girl trained every day to become stronger than anyone else.[lr]::
11535::$$$message_0115_0007_0001$$$::If an ailing country, headed toward its own demise, can only be saved by a king...[lr]::
11536::$$$message_0115_0007_0002$$$::...the girl had sworn to wield her sword for that reason, and that reason alone, without anyone ever needing to tell her to do so.::
11537::$$$message_0115_0008_0000$$$::And then the prophesied day arrived.[lr]::
11538::$$$message_0115_0008_0001$$$::Knights and lords from around the nation gathered in hopes of being chosen to be king.[lr]::
11539::$$$message_0115_0008_0002$$$::If this was to be a contest to determine the best possible king, all assumed the selection would be made in a mounted joust.[lr]::
11540::$$$message_0115_0008_0003$$$::Instead, all that waited at the site of selection was a naked blade, thrust into a stone.::
11541::$$$message_0115_0009_0000$$$::On the hilt of the sword, a glittering golden inscription read: [lr]::
11542::$$$message_0115_0009_0001$$$::"Whosoever pulleth this sword from this stone is the rightful King of England."[r]::
11543::$$$message_0115_0009_0002$$$::Many knights took their turn trying to draw the sword from the stone.[lr]::
11544::$$$message_0115_0009_0003$$$::But none were able to draw the sword from the stone, so the knights decided to compete in a joust, as they had originally expected on arriving.::
11545::$$$message_0115_0010_0000$$$::The girl was not yet a knight, and so could not participate in the joust.[lr]::
11546::$$$message_0115_0010_0001$$$::She approached the Stone of Selection, which sat largely abandoned, its appeal having long since faded, and reached for the sword's hilt. She did not hesitate.::
11547::$$$message_0115_0011_0000$$$::"Wait just a second there. Maybe you should think before you take hold of that."::
11548::$$$message_0115_0012_0000$$$::She turned around, and before her stood the most feared mage in the nation.[lr]::
11549::$$$message_0115_0012_0001$$$::He gave his warning: [lr]::
11550::$$$message_0115_0012_0002$$$::Once she takes hold of that sword, she will cease to be human.::
11551::$$$message_0115_0013_0000$$$::She responded only with a nod.[lr]::
11552::$$$message_0115_0013_0001$$$::To be king is to no longer be human.[lr]::
11553::$$$message_0115_0013_0002$$$::She has been resolved to this from the moment she was born.[lr]::
11554::$$$message_0115_0013_0003$$$::To be king is to kill more than anyone, in protection of everyone.[lr]::
11555::$$$message_0115_0013_0004$$$::The young girl thought of this every night, and lay in bed, shivering at the implications, until morning.[lr]::
11556::$$$message_0115_0013_0005$$$::Not a day went by that she was not afraid.[lr]::
11557::$$$message_0115_0013_0006$$$::But in that moment, she pledged that her days of fear were at an end.::
11558::$$$message_0115_0014_0000$$$::She drew the sword effortlessly from the stone, and bright light engulfed the whole of the site of selection.[lr]::
11559::$$$message_0115_0014_0001$$$::   And in that instant, she ceased to be human.[lr]::
11560::$$$message_0115_0014_0002$$$::A king's sex does not matter.[lr]::
11561::$$$message_0115_0014_0003$$$::So long as they carry out the function of a king, none would care about a king's appearance, or even bother to pay attention to such a thing.::
11562::$$$message_0115_0015_0000$$$::And even if someone noticed the king was a woman, it would not matter, so long as she was a good king.[lr]::
11563::$$$message_0115_0015_0001$$$::The sword's magical energy must have halted her growth.[lr]::
11564::$$$message_0115_0015_0002$$$::While many knights found it eerie and feared her, most saw their lord's immortality as a divine gift...::
11565::$$$message_0115_0016_0000$$$::And so...[lr]::
11566::$$$message_0115_0016_0001$$$::...the legendary, celebrated age of the king began.::
11567::$$$message_0115_0017_0000$$$::The new king, in battle, was seen as something of a god of war.[lr]::
11568::$$$message_0115_0017_0001$$$::The king always led from the front.[lr]::
11569::$$$message_0115_0017_0002$$$::No enemies could stand in her way.[lr]::
11570::$$$message_0115_0017_0003$$$::Altria...the god of battle.[lr]::
11571::$$$message_0115_0017_0004$$$::Hailed as a dragon incarnate, she knew no defeat.::
11572::$$$message_0115_0018_0000$$$::In ten years, she fought twelve battles, and never once lost.[lr]::
11573::$$$message_0115_0018_0001$$$::In those days, her chief duty as king was on the battlefield.[lr]::
11574::$$$message_0115_0018_0002$$$::Not once did she turn back. Not once was she disgraced.[lr]::
11575::$$$message_0115_0018_0003$$$::She was raised to kingship, and fulfilled her obligations without hesitation.::
11576::$$$message_0115_0019_0000$$$::Maybe that's why I had a vision of her.::
11577::$$$message_0115_0020_0000$$$::Her soul must still be on the battlefield.[lr]::
11578::$$$message_0115_0020_0001$$$::It's not yet dawn.[lr]::
11579::$$$message_0115_0020_0002$$$::She stands under the indigo sky, and lets the wind whip at her as she stares off into the distance.::
11580::$$$message_0115_0021_0000$$$::The sky is high and clouds slide by overhead.[lr]::
11581::$$$message_0115_0021_0001$$$::Out in the clear air, sword in hand, she gazes at the great army she's about to confront.::
11582::$$$message_0115_0022_0000$$$::   That image of her won't leave me. It's burned into my mind now.[lr]::
11583::$$$message_0115_0022_0001$$$::She and her sword are one.[lr]::
11584::$$$message_0115_0022_0002$$$::The sword from the stone, which chose the king.[lr]::
11585::$$$message_0115_0022_0003$$$::The brilliance of the sword that determined her fate is also her brilliance.::
11586::$$$message_0115_0023_0000$$$::But I tilt my head in wonder at this dream.[lr]::
11587::$$$message_0115_0023_0001$$$::That sword...isn't the one she holds.[lr]::
11588::$$$message_0115_0023_0002$$$::It's similar, but different.[lr]::
11589::$$$message_0115_0023_0003$$$::The sword she holds now isn't the one she used last night.::
11590::$$$message_0115_0024_0000$$$::But if that's the case...[lr]::
11591::$$$message_0115_0024_0001$$$::...what happened to that incredible sword?::
11592::$$$message_0115_0025_0000$$$::When I wake from my dream, I find myself in my own room.[lr]::
11593::$$$message_0115_0025_0001$$$::It's bright outside.[lr]::
11594::$$$message_0115_0025_0002$$$::I must have come back to my room last night, unable to make a decision, then fallen asleep while I was watching over Saber.::
11595::$$$message_0115_0026_0000$$$::"That was...a dream...?"[lr]::
11596::$$$message_0115_0026_0001$$$::It was a strange dream.[lr]::
11597::$$$message_0115_0026_0002$$$::What I saw... I had no way of knowing any of that. And that wasn't the Saber I know...[lr]::
11598::$$$message_0115_0026_0003$$$::Is it even possible for me to dream of such a thing?::
11599::$$$message_0115_0027_0000$$$::"But that sword was definitely different from the one Saber had..."::
11600::$$$message_0115_0028_0000$$$::I rack my brain.[lr]::
11601::$$$message_0115_0028_0001$$$::Saber's identity had been unclear.[lr]::
11602::$$$message_0115_0028_0002$$$::And honestly, I still can't get my head around who she really is.[lr]::
11603::$$$message_0115_0028_0003$$$::Saber is Saber.[lr]::
11604::$$$message_0115_0028_0004$$$::I can't change the way I act around her, and I don't think Saber would want that in any case.::
11605::$$$message_0115_0029_0000$$$::"...But she looked incredible."[lr]::
11606::$$$message_0115_0029_0001$$$::She looked really cool with that sword last night, but she looked good with the sword in my dreams too.[lr]::
11607::$$$message_0115_0029_0002$$$::It'd be fair to say I was in awe.[lr]::
11608::$$$message_0115_0029_0003$$$::The sword last night, and the sword from my dream seem to have left one hell of an impression on me. I guess I've got a thing for swords.::
11609::$$$message_0115_0030_0000$$$::I thought Lancer's spear was beautiful when I saw it too, but my passion for swords is on a whole other level.[lr]::
11610::$$$message_0115_0030_0001$$$::It would appear I have a thing for swords.::
11611::$$$message_0115_0031_0000$$$::"Well...that's not really anything new."[lr]::
11612::$$$message_0115_0031_0001$$$::I draw in a deep breath and reach up, finding my forehead dripping with sweat.::
11613::$$$message_0115_0032_0000$$$::"It sure is hot here."[lr]::
11614::$$$message_0115_0032_0001$$$::I wipe the sweat from my forehead.[lr]::
11615::$$$message_0115_0032_0002$$$::It's winter, but my body feels flushed.[lr]::
11616::$$$message_0115_0032_0003$$$::I don't know why, but it feels like my blood is getting hotter, and it's...unsettling.::
11617::$$$message_0115_0033_0000$$$::"I wonder why...ever since I saw Saber's sword, I..."[lr]::
11618::$$$message_0115_0033_0001$$$::My whole body's been hot for some reason.[lr]::
11619::$$$message_0115_0033_0002$$$::My left hand, the one with my Command Spells, feels like it's holding a hand warmer.::
11620::$$$message_0115_0034_0000$$$::"It's the same sensation I felt when Tohsaka made me swallow a jewel...like there's something stirring in me, or making me want to run."[lr]::
11621::$$$message_0115_0034_0001$$$::I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself.::
11622::$$$message_0115_0035_0000$$$::"...Saber's probably still asleep."[lr]::
11623::$$$message_0115_0035_0001$$$::She still hasn't woken up.[lr]::
11624::$$$message_0115_0035_0002$$$::But it looks like she's stabilizing.[lr]::
11625::$$$message_0115_0035_0003$$$::Her breathing is even, and that pained look she had last night has smoothed over.[lr]::
11626::$$$message_0115_0035_0004$$$::Saber is sleeping peacefully.[lr]::
11627::$$$message_0115_0035_0005$$$::It's a morning like any other.::
11628::$$$message_0115_0036_0000$$$::"Maybe..."[lr]::
11629::$$$message_0115_0036_0001$$$::Maybe if I let her sleep, Saber will recover.[lr]::
11630::$$$message_0115_0036_0002$$$::That way, I won't have to make her kill anyone.[lr]::
11631::$$$message_0115_0036_0003$$$::Then she could stay with me, just like she has been...::
11632::$$$message_0115_0037_0000$$$::"How could I be so selfish?"[lr]::
11633::$$$message_0115_0037_0001$$$::I slam my fist into the wall.[lr]::
11634::$$$message_0115_0037_0002$$$::My own weakness nauseates me.::
11635::$$$message_0115_0038_0000$$$::"It's my fault Saber turned out this way![lr]::
11636::$$$message_0115_0038_0001$$$::What the hell am I going to...!?"[lr]::
11637::$$$message_0115_0038_0002$$$::I stand up without another sound.[lr]::
11638::$$$message_0115_0038_0003$$$::I don't know when Saber's going to wake up.[lr]::
11639::$$$message_0115_0038_0004$$$::But I have to make a decision before she does.::
11640::$$$message_0115_0039_0000$$$::Tohsaka's not up yet.[lr]::
11641::$$$message_0115_0039_0001$$$::The house is completely dead, and the corridor feels deserted.[lr]::
11642::$$$message_0115_0039_0002$$$::No, it only feels like that because I'm so down.[lr]::
11643::$$$message_0115_0039_0003$$$::I can't decide what to do, so the whole world feels hazy, and I'm just wandering in that grayness.::
11644::$$$message_0115_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]Huh?[font italic=false][lr]::
11645::$$$message_0115_0040_0001$$$::I hear something cutting through the air.::
11646::$$$message_0115_0041_0000$$$::"There it is again...it's coming from the yard...but that's..."[lr]::
11647::$$$message_0115_0041_0001$$$::I know that sound.[lr]::
11648::$$$message_0115_0041_0002$$$::Well...[lr]::
11649::$$$message_0115_0041_0003$$$::I don't feel like making breakfast, so I'll go take a walk and check it out.::
11650::$$$message_0115_0042_0000$$$::It's colder than usual.[lr]::
11651::$$$message_0115_0042_0001$$$::Must be [font italic=true]really[font italic=false] cold for me to feel it, feverish as I am.[lr]::
11652::$$$message_0115_0042_0002$$$::It looks like it might even snow.::
11653::$$$message_0115_0043_0000$$$::"It's coming from the shed."[lr]::
11654::$$$message_0115_0043_0001$$$::The sound of...something slicing through the air reaches me at regular intervals.[lr]::
11655::$$$message_0115_0043_0002$$$::As I cross the yard, my breath mists the air.::
11656::$$$message_0115_0044_0000$$$::I find him in front of the shed.[lr]::
11657::$$$message_0115_0044_0001$$$::Given how unsurprised I am to find him, I guess I figured he'd be here.[lr]::
11658::$$$message_0115_0044_0002$$$::He must have been shooting his arrows.[lr]::
11659::$$$message_0115_0044_0003$$$::The moment Archer sees me, he lowers his bow in displeasure.::
11660::$$$message_0115_0045_0000$$$::"That's dangerous. Don't shoot arrows in my house. What were you going to do if one hit something?"[lr]::
11661::$$$message_0115_0045_0001$$$::"Nothing in particular. I wasn't using arrows to begin with. Can't hit anything if you're not shooting anything."::
11662::$$$message_0115_0046_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
11663::$$$message_0115_0046_0001$$$::He doesn't have to tell me that.[lr]::
11664::$$$message_0115_0046_0002$$$::So the sound was just his bow itself.[lr]::
11665::$$$message_0115_0046_0003$$$::For some reason, Archer was just plucking his bowstring, not firing arrows.::
11666::$$$message_0115_0047_0000$$$::"That's a good-looking bow. Didn't want to say as much earlier, but I guess you're a bona fide Archer."::
11667::$$$message_0115_0048_0000$$$::"I wonder. I'm not an archer like you understand it, so even if you ask, I can't teach you anything about archery.[lr]::
11668::$$$message_0115_0048_0001$$$::Your archery is about shooting arrows for yourself. Mine are used to strike at enemies. You think of archers with a concern for things like civility."::
11669::$$$message_0115_0049_0000$$$::His lip curls snidely.[lr]::
11670::$$$message_0115_0049_0001$$$::I still can't stand this guy.::
11671::$$$message_0115_0050_0000$$$::"I never thought to ask you about archery in the first place.[lr]::
11672::$$$message_0115_0050_0001$$$::I was just wondering what you were doing."[lr]::
11673::$$$message_0115_0050_0002$$$::"As you can see, I'm just keeping my skills sharp.[lr]::
11674::$$$message_0115_0050_0003$$$::The injuries I sustained from Saber have healed. I can't stay on guard duty forever."::
11675::$$$message_0115_0051_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
11676::$$$message_0115_0051_0001$$$::...I see.[lr]::
11677::$$$message_0115_0051_0002$$$::So his wounds have healed. That means Tohsaka will get back into the fight.::
11678::$$$message_0115_0052_0000$$$::I turn on my heel.[lr]::
11679::$$$message_0115_0052_0001$$$::If Tohsaka and Archer are going to rejoin the battle, I need to make a decision too.[lr]::
11680::$$$message_0115_0052_0002$$$::I need to go somewhere I can think alone.::
11681::$$$message_0115_0053_0000$$$::"Have you ever heard the word 'zanshin' before?"[lr]::
11682::$$$message_0115_0053_0001$$$::"Huh?"::
11683::$$$message_0115_0054_0000$$$::"It literally means 'lingering heart' and it's a concept dealing with the time you have after making your move.[lr]::
11684::$$$message_0115_0054_0001$$$::I feel it's the only thing my archery and your kyudou discipline have in common."[lr]::
11685::$$$message_0115_0054_0002$$$::"What? I didn't ask for a lecture on the eight stages of shooting."::
11686::$$$message_0115_0055_0000$$$::"Just listen. They say the body remains in the same place after you shoot a bow. That's what zanshin is."[lr]::
11687::$$$message_0115_0055_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
11688::$$$message_0115_0055_0002$$$::Yes, there are eight movements in kyudou called the shaho-hassetsu, which are the eight principles of shooting.[lr]::
11689::$$$message_0115_0055_0003$$$::The final step, zanshin, is what follows after releasing your arrow.::
11690::$$$message_0115_0056_0000$$$::"Yeah? What about it?"[lr]::
11691::$$$message_0115_0056_0001$$$::"I'm talking about preparedness. Zanshin is not about making sure your arrow strikes the target.[lr]::
11692::$$$message_0115_0056_0002$$$::An arrow has already struck its target by the time it's released. The shooter simply moves according to the image they envision.[lr]::
11693::$$$message_0115_0056_0003$$$::So they don't need to check whether it's hit or not.[lr]::
11694::$$$message_0115_0056_0004$$$::If, when you shoot, you think your arrow won't hit, it won't. If you believe it will, it will."::
11695::$$$message_0115_0057_0000$$$::"That's absurd. No matter how much you might think a shot will hit, some shots won't. If all they had to do is think it will hit, everyone would hit every shot, every time."::
11696::$$$message_0115_0058_0000$$$::"Do you really think so? You, at least, hit the target every time."[lr]::
11697::$$$message_0115_0058_0001$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
11698::$$$message_0115_0058_0002$$$::He catches me off guard there.[lr]::
11699::$$$message_0115_0058_0003$$$::I mean, he's right, but...::
11700::$$$message_0115_0059_0000$$$::"Well, I don't care about that. The point I'm trying to make is this: zanshin isn't about determining whether or not your arrow hits; everyone knows what happens to the arrow they fire.[lr]::
11701::$$$message_0115_0059_0001$$$::Zanshin is the mindset of accepting the consequences of the shot."::
11702::$$$message_0115_0060_0000$$$::"I know that. You're telling me I need to follow through to the very end."::
11703::$$$message_0115_0061_0000$$$::"Exactly. I heard what happened to Saber. She must have known something like this would happen from the start. Fighting without any chance of renewing her magical energy could only lead to her disappearing.[lr]::
11704::$$$message_0115_0061_0001$$$::That was already determined. Then..."::
11705::$$$message_0115_0062_0000$$$::...all that's left is to accept the result.[lr]::
11706::$$$message_0115_0062_0001$$$::He's telling me that no matter what I decide, no matter what it does to Saber, all I can do is see it through.::
11707::$$$message_0115_0063_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
11708::$$$message_0115_0063_0001$$$::I turn my back to Archer.[lr]::
11709::$$$message_0115_0063_0002$$$::This time, I'm going to be the one to leave Archer hanging.::
11710::$$$message_0115_0064_0000$$$::"Oh and one more thing. I'll go ahead and tell you since you don't seem to have figured it out."[lr]::
11711::$$$message_0115_0064_0001$$$::His voice comes from behind me.::
11712::$$$message_0115_0065_0000$$$::"Saber must have known she would disappear if she used her Noble Phantasm. She probably never intended to use her Noble Phantasm in the first place."[lr]::
11713::$$$message_0115_0065_0001$$$::This time, I hear nothing of his usual sarcasm.::
11714::$$$message_0115_0066_0000$$$::"But she [font italic=true]did[font italic=false] use her Noble Phantasm. There can be only one reason for that...[lr]::
11715::$$$message_0115_0066_0001$$$::Saber chose protecting you over keeping herself from disappearing.[lr]::
11716::$$$message_0115_0066_0002$$$::Never forget that."[lr]::
11717::$$$message_0115_0066_0003$$$::For once, his voice is completely sincere. He's only telling the truth here.::
