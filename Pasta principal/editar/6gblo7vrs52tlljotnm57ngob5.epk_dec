2454::$$$message_0022_0000_0000$$$::Anyway.[lr]::
2455::$$$message_0022_0000_0001$$$::Now that we've talked a bit, my body's cooled down, so we should get back to training.::
2456::$$$message_0022_0001_0000$$$::"Saber, let's go again. I've had a chance to rest."[lr]::
2457::$$$message_0022_0001_0001$$$::"Are you sure? You do seem to have cooled down, but you also appear to be in pain."::
2458::$$$message_0022_0002_0000$$$::"It's fine. Just bruises, so I can deal with it. Besides, I'm healing automatically now anyway."[lr]::
2459::$$$message_0022_0002_0001$$$::"But if it gets worse, this training will be pointless. I believe we should wait longer and see."::
2460::$$$message_0022_0003_0000$$$::"It's fine. I want to do more before Tohsaka comes home. I wouldn't want her seeing me in this state."::
2461::$$$message_0022_0004_0000$$$::"...I understand. It would not do to have Rin, who will eventually become our enemy, learn about your abilities.[lr]::
2462::$$$message_0022_0004_0001$$$::Reckless though it may be, I suppose we should pick up the pace a bit."::
2463::$$$message_0022_0005_0000$$$::Saber picks her shinai up from the floor.[lr]::
2464::$$$message_0022_0005_0001$$$::But then...[lr]::
2465::$$$message_0022_0005_0002$$$::...a really out of place sound echoes through the dojo.::
2466::$$$message_0022_0006_0000$$$::"Saber...?"[lr]::
2467::$$$message_0022_0006_0001$$$::I think her stomach is growling.[lr]::
2468::$$$message_0022_0006_0002$$$::"It seems I am hungry. I had not noticed, engrossed in our training as I was."::
2469::$$$message_0022_0007_0000$$$::"Oh, yeah. Now that you mention it, it's lunchtime."[lr]::
2470::$$$message_0022_0007_0001$$$::I can't blame her for her stomach growling.[lr]::
2471::$$$message_0022_0007_0002$$$::I'm not that hungry yet, but if Saber is, we should have lunch.[lr]::
2472::$$$message_0022_0007_0003$$$::And if during that time, I heal more, that's even better.::
2473::$$$message_0022_0008_0000$$$::"Hey, it's lunchtime anyway. I'll go buy some groceries, so you can rest in the living room."[lr]::
2474::$$$message_0022_0008_0001$$$::"Shirou. If you are going out, I will accompany you."::
2475::$$$message_0022_0009_0000$$$::"I'll be fine. I'm just going to the shopping district nearby. No one would attack me in broad daylight, and you might just attract more attention if you did come with me."[lr]::
2476::$$$message_0022_0009_0001$$$::"...Are you sure it will not be dangerous?"[lr]::
2477::$$$message_0022_0009_0002$$$::"I'm sure. Just wait here; I'll be right back."::
2478::$$$message_0022_0010_0000$$$::I grab my wallet and head out.[lr]::
2479::$$$message_0022_0010_0001$$$::It doesn't take more than ten minutes to get to the shopping district by bike.[lr]::
2480::$$$message_0022_0010_0002$$$::The bicycle I take from the garage today is Unit Two. Unit One is still parked in front of Ryudou Temple.::
2481::$$$message_0022_0011_0000$$$::I bike down the hill.[lr]::
2482::$$$message_0022_0011_0001$$$::I haven't gone to the shopping district midday on a weekday since I was a kid.::
2483::$$$message_0022_0012_0000$$$::The intersection is packed with housewives returning from midday shopping.[lr]::
2484::$$$message_0022_0012_0001$$$::They're coming from the neighborhood shopping center Sakura and I frequent.::
2485::$$$message_0022_0013_0000$$$::I finish buying a bag of groceries.[lr]::
2486::$$$message_0022_0013_0001$$$::Enough food to make lunch for two and a light snack.[lr]::
2487::$$$message_0022_0013_0002$$$::I don't buy anything for dinner since Tohsaka's in charge of that tonight, but I do buy enough bread for four for tomorrow's breakfast. [lr]::
2488::$$$message_0022_0013_0003$$$::I don't know how to make strawberry jam, so I reach for the cheapest...well, no. That might get some complaints. So I go for an expensive jar instead.::
2489::$$$message_0022_0014_0000$$$::"Damn, this is really eating into my wallet. Why the hell do I have to spend a thousand yen on something so sugary?"[lr]::
2490::$$$message_0022_0014_0001$$$::I load the groceries onto my bike as I grumble.[lr]::
2491::$$$message_0022_0014_0002$$$::But then...[lr]::
2492::$$$message_0022_0014_0003$$$::I feel someone tugging at me from behind.::
2493::$$$message_0022_0015_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
2494::$$$message_0022_0015_0001$$$::I turn around, wondering who it is.[lr]::
2495::$$$message_0022_0015_0002$$$::Standing there...[lr]::
2496::$$$message_0022_0015_0003$$$::...is a silver-haired little girl.::
2497::$$$message_0022_0016_0000$$$::"Y-you're..."[lr]::
2498::$$$message_0022_0016_0001$$$::I stumble backward, knocking over my bike.::
2499::$$$message_0022_0017_0000$$$::While I brace myself, the girl just looks up at me with a smile.::
2500::$$$message_0022_0018_0000$$$::"What?"[lr]::
2501::$$$message_0022_0018_0001$$$::I can't sense so much as a hint of animosity or murderous intent from her.[lr]::
2502::$$$message_0022_0018_0002$$$::To top it all off, the little girl says,[lr]::
2503::$$$message_0022_0018_0003$$$::"I'm glad to see you alive, big brother."[lr]::
2504::$$$message_0022_0018_0004$$$::She looks so happy.::
2505::$$$message_0022_0019_0000$$$::"...The hell."[lr]::
2506::$$$message_0022_0019_0001$$$::She's definitely Berserker's Master.[lr]::
2507::$$$message_0022_0019_0002$$$::She's the Master of the monster who almost tore me in half with a single blow.[lr]::
2508::$$$message_0022_0019_0003$$$::Not the sort of person I'd expect to just run into in the shopping district in the middle of the day.::
2509::$$$message_0022_0020_0000$$$::"You're not...planning to fight here, are you?"[lr]::
2510::$$$message_0022_0020_0001$$$::"Hm? Why would you say something silly? We're not supposed to fight while it's still light out."[lr]::
2511::$$$message_0022_0020_0002$$$::The little girl pouts.[lr]::
2512::$$$message_0022_0020_0003$$$::She's certainly acting like the little girl she seems to be.::
2513::$$$message_0022_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2514::$$$message_0022_0021_0001$$$::I have no idea what she must be thinking.[lr]::
2515::$$$message_0022_0021_0002$$$::I can at least sense that she doesn't pose any threat though.::
2516::$$$message_0022_0022_0000$$$::"Y-you're..."[lr]::
2517::$$$message_0022_0022_0001$$$::"Illyasviel von Einzbern. You can call me Illya for short. What's your name?"::
2518::$$$message_0022_0023_0000$$$::"Me? I'm Shirou Emiya."[lr]::
2519::$$$message_0022_0023_0001$$$::"Shiroemiya? That's a tongue twister."::
2520::$$$message_0022_0024_0000$$$::"...Er, nobody's ever said it like that. If it's hard to remember, just call me Shirou. That's my first name."::
2521::$$$message_0022_0025_0000$$$::"Shirou? That's easier. Shirou, huh... Yep, it has a nice ring to it. It's simple, but also kind of haughty at the same time."[lr]::
2522::$$$message_0022_0025_0001$$$::Illyasviel looks at me suggestively.::
2523::$$$message_0022_0026_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
2524::$$$message_0022_0026_0001$$$::I find myself shifting my weight so I can be ready to run at an instant, purely by instinct.[lr]::
2525::$$$message_0022_0026_0002$$$::She [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] Berserker's Master.[lr]::
2526::$$$message_0022_0026_0003$$$::If she gets it in her head, she can probably just order him to crush me, along with the florist next to me.::
2527::$$$message_0022_0027_0000$$$::"You don't have to be so tense, Shirou. I left Berserker at home today. You didn't bring Saber with you either, so we're even."[lr]::
2528::$$$message_0022_0027_0001$$$::Illyasviel looks up at me cheerfully.::
2529::$$$message_0022_0028_0000$$$::"Well, I'm not sure 'even' is the right word..."[lr]::
2530::$$$message_0022_0028_0001$$$::"Hey, let's talk! There's so much I wanted to talk to you about!"::
2531::$$$message_0022_0029_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
2532::$$$message_0022_0029_0001$$$::The little girl tugs on my arm, as if she were taking her father's hand.::
2533::$$$message_0022_0030_0000$$$::"W-w-wait, wait, wait, wait! What's the big idea? I-i-i-is this some weird new strategy you thought up!?"[lr]::
2534::$$$message_0022_0030_0001$$$::"What do you mean? I just want to talk. Kids make friends and talk with them all the time, right?"::
2535::$$$message_0022_0031_0000$$$::"Uh...that may be true, but that doesn't really apply to us! We're both Masters, and we've already fought each other before! We're actually enemies!"::
2536::$$$message_0022_0032_0000$$$::"That's not true. I don't have any enemies. The other Masters are more like pests to me. But if you're good, I might let you go."::
2537::$$$message_0022_0033_0000$$$::She smiles wide as she says this.[lr]::
2538::$$$message_0022_0033_0001$$$::"Argh! Just...stay back, okay? What's wrong with you!?"[lr]::
2539::$$$message_0022_0033_0002$$$::I jerk my arm to throw Illyasviel's hand off.::
2540::$$$message_0022_0034_0000$$$::"Kya...!"[lr]::
2541::$$$message_0022_0034_0001$$$::She's about to fall.[lr]::
2542::$$$message_0022_0034_0002$$$::She nearly falls flat on her back because of how hard I shook her off.::
2543::$$$message_0022_0035_0000$$$::"Oh crap, Illya...!"[lr]::
2544::$$$message_0022_0035_0001$$$::I don't know why I did that.[lr]::
2545::$$$message_0022_0035_0002$$$::The next thing I know, I'm reaching for Illyasviel[line2]argh, her name is too long[line2]Illya's waist, and try to catch her before she falls to the ground.::
2546::$$$message_0022_0036_0000$$$::I lower Illya to the ground without saying a thing.[lr]::
2547::$$$message_0022_0036_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
2548::$$$message_0022_0036_0002$$$::Illya is silent.[lr]::
2549::$$$message_0022_0036_0003$$$::I don't know what to say myself, so I just stand there, looking down at Illya.::
2550::$$$message_0022_0037_0000$$$::...Well, this is awkward.[lr]::
2551::$$$message_0022_0037_0001$$$::So awkward, in fact, that I'm about to just turn around and leave, but then...::
2552::$$$message_0022_0038_0000$$$::"Why...? Do you hate me or something?"[lr]::
2553::$$$message_0022_0038_0001$$$::She asks with the same glow in her red eyesâ€¦[lr]::
2554::$$$message_0022_0038_0002$$$::...that she had when she spoke to me the other night, when she was with Berserker.::
2555::$$$message_0022_0039_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
2556::$$$message_0022_0039_0001$$$::A chill runs down my spine.[lr]::
2557::$$$message_0022_0039_0002$$$::I sensed no danger earlier, but she's just reminded me that she's still Berserker's Master.::
2558::$$$message_0022_0040_0000$$$::If I cross her, I'm dead.[lr]::
2559::$$$message_0022_0040_0001$$$::I'd never be able to face Saber if I died in vain here, and everyone in the shopping district would get dragged into this as well.[lr]::
2560::$$$message_0022_0040_0002$$$::Yeah, that's a safe bet.[lr]::
2561::$$$message_0022_0040_0003$$$::Illya is willing to use her powers anywhere.::
2562::$$$message_0022_0041_0000$$$::"Fine. You just want to talk, right? I'll do what you want then, so will that be all right, Illya?"::
2563::$$$message_0022_0042_0000$$$::"Yep! Then let's go to the park! I passed by it earlier and there was nobody there."[lr]::
2564::$$$message_0022_0042_0001$$$::Illya skips off toward the park.::
2565::$$$message_0022_0043_0000$$$::"Come on, hurry! If you don't, I'll leave you behind, Shirou!"[lr]::
2566::$$$message_0022_0043_0001$$$::Illya spins around as she runs through the shopping district.::
2567::$$$message_0022_0044_0000$$$::"She really did go ahead without me."[lr]::
2568::$$$message_0022_0044_0001$$$::I'm more moved than I am confused.[lr]::
2569::$$$message_0022_0044_0002$$$::Apparently, once you promise Illya something, she treats it as the absolute truth.::
2570::$$$message_0022_0045_0000$$$::And that's why she just skipped off so happily.[lr]::
2571::$$$message_0022_0045_0001$$$::It's also why, even though she left me behind, I don't even consider taking the opportunity to run for it.[lr]::
2572::$$$message_0022_0045_0002$$$::I'd already promised her I was going to talk with her, and she clearly trusts that.::
2573::$$$message_0022_0046_0000$$$::"...What's with her?"[lr]::
2574::$$$message_0022_0046_0001$$$::She sure is unstable.[lr]::
2575::$$$message_0022_0046_0002$$$::But then again...[lr]::
2576::$$$message_0022_0046_0003$$$::I haven't yet gotten to an age where I'm so cynical as to betray a little girl's trust.::
2577::$$$message_0022_0047_0000$$$::Illya and I are the only two in the park a little ways from the shopping district.[lr]::
2578::$$$message_0022_0047_0001$$$::Kids are in school at this hour...or maybe the park's not as popular anymore.[lr]::
2579::$$$message_0022_0047_0002$$$::Our conversation begins in the tense, wintry air of the park.::
2580::$$$message_0022_0048_0000$$$::"So, let's talk. What do you want to talk about?[lr]::
2581::$$$message_0022_0048_0001$$$::Do you want to know about Saber?"[lr]::
2582::$$$message_0022_0048_0002$$$::"Eh? About Saber? Why?"::
2583::$$$message_0022_0049_0000$$$::"We're Masters. Don't you want to get information about the other Servants?"[lr]::
2584::$$$message_0022_0049_0001$$$::"I don't want to talk about that kind of stuff. I'll get bored if we don't talk about something funner."::
2585::$$$message_0022_0050_0000$$$::"I don't really find anything in particular boring, but...okay, what do you think is fun?"[lr]::
2586::$$$message_0022_0050_0001$$$::"I don't know.[lr]::
2587::$$$message_0022_0050_0002$$$::I haven't really talked to people much, so I don't know what to talk about."::
2588::$$$message_0022_0051_0000$$$::"So you brought me out here, not knowing what to talk about? Didn't anyone teach you to think before you act? They didn't, did they? Then from now on, you're going to be a proper, thoughtful adult."::
2589::$$$message_0022_0052_0000$$$::"Hm. No thanks. I'll leave all that to you, Shirou.[lr]::
2590::$$$message_0022_0052_0001$$$::Isn't it a man's responsibility to escort a lady?[lr]::
2591::$$$message_0022_0052_0002$$$::So I just have to follow you."::
2592::$$$message_0022_0053_0000$$$::She smiles and leans against my shoulder.[lr]::
2593::$$$message_0022_0053_0001$$$::She doesn't seem like she's being touchy-feely. If anything, it's like a small animal huddling against something to stay warm.[lr]::
2594::$$$message_0022_0053_0002$$$::Huh.[lr]::
2595::$$$message_0022_0053_0003$$$::Now that I'm paying more attention, she does look cold.::
2596::$$$message_0022_0054_0000$$$::"Illya. Are you cold?"[lr]::
2597::$$$message_0022_0054_0001$$$::"Eh? Yeah, I am. I don't like the cold."::
2598::$$$message_0022_0055_0000$$$::She breathes out a puff of white mist.[lr]::
2599::$$$message_0022_0055_0001$$$::Though she says she doesn't like the cold, she seems enchanted by her misting breath.::
2600::$$$message_0022_0056_0000$$$::"I see. It's a lot colder than usual today. You'll just have to endure the cold for now, but...where did you come from? Your name sounds kind of noble or something."::
2601::$$$message_0022_0057_0000$$$::"I'm not 'kind of' a noble. I AM a noble.[lr]::
2602::$$$message_0022_0057_0001$$$::I was born in an old castle owned by the Einzbern family.[lr]::
2603::$$$message_0022_0057_0002$$$::It was always cold and snowing. So I'm used to it being cold like this."::
2604::$$$message_0022_0058_0000$$$::"Huh? You were born in a cold country? Shouldn't you be used to the cold then?"::
2605::$$$message_0022_0059_0000$$$::"Yes, but I just don't like it. I like it warm much better. Don't you like it warm too, Shirou?"[lr]::
2606::$$$message_0022_0059_0001$$$::"Yeah, obviously. I'd rather it be warm than cold."::
2607::$$$message_0022_0060_0000$$$::"I know! That's why I like to stay inside and keep warm when it's cold out. But I like snow. It's white, and Father said it was like my hair."::
2608::$$$message_0022_0061_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2609::$$$message_0022_0061_0001$$$::I clap my hands together in wonderment.[lr]::
2610::$$$message_0022_0061_0002$$$::Now that she's mentioned it, I realize something.[lr]::
2611::$$$message_0022_0061_0003$$$::I didn't know what Illya reminded me of, but if ever there was such a thing as a snow fairy, it'd probably look like her.::
2612::$$$message_0022_0062_0000$$$::"Your dad's pretty clever. Your hair [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] like snow: soft and white."::
2613::$$$message_0022_0063_0000$$$::"Ehehe. Right? I'm proud of my hair. I got it from Mother, and it's the only girly thing about me."::
2614::$$$message_0022_0064_0000$$$::Illya giggles joyfully.[lr]::
2615::$$$message_0022_0064_0001$$$::Seeing her acting this way leaves me numb.[lr]::
2616::$$$message_0022_0064_0002$$$::If I hadn't already seen it for myself, I'd never believe this girl could be Berserker's Master.::
2617::$$$message_0022_0065_0000$$$::"What about you, Shirou? Did you get anything from your dad? Don't say a Magic Crest, okay?[lr]::
2618::$$$message_0022_0065_0001$$$::I want to know what you got from your dad as his son, not as a Master."::
2619::$$$message_0022_0066_0000$$$::"Uh, me? Hmmm, I guess the last thing I got from him was the house.[lr]::
2620::$$$message_0022_0066_0001$$$::Before that was my last name. And the first thing I got was..."[lr]::
2621::$$$message_0022_0066_0002$$$::...A chance at living again, when I was about to die.[lr]::
2622::$$$message_0022_0066_0003$$$::I was the only one Kiritsugu managed to save in that fire ten years ago.::
2623::$$$message_0022_0067_0000$$$::"Let's see...I didn't get any physical features like you did from your parents, but I think I got plenty of things that were just as good."::
2624::$$$message_0022_0068_0000$$$::Illya looks delighted, as if it was a story about her.[lr]::
2625::$$$message_0022_0068_0001$$$::Who wouldn't be happy, seeing a smile like that?::
2626::$$$message_0022_0069_0000$$$::"But from what you just said, you didn't get his Magic Crest. That's weird. Does that mean you're not a Master?"::
2627::$$$message_0022_0070_0000$$$::"Huh? Well, I'm an apprentice mage without a Magic Crest, but I'm a Master.[lr]::
2628::$$$message_0022_0070_0001$$$::Now that you mention it, you...you're a Master, which makes you a mage, right?"::
2629::$$$message_0022_0071_0000$$$::"Huh? I'm not a mage. I'm a Master.[lr]::
2630::$$$message_0022_0071_0001$$$::I was never taught magecraft."::
2631::$$$message_0022_0072_0000$$$::"Huh!? Then you didn't inherit your parents' Magic Crest? But I thought your family was a prominent one, since you have a castle and all."[lr]::
2632::$$$message_0022_0072_0001$$$::"That's true...but don't you need a Magic Crest to be a Master? So that's why I'm a Master."::
2633::$$$message_0022_0073_0000$$$::Illya tilts her head in confusion.[lr]::
2634::$$$message_0022_0073_0001$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
2635::$$$message_0022_0073_0002$$$::Now I'm confused too.[lr]::
2636::$$$message_0022_0073_0003$$$::Illya's words seem...off. It feels like we're each having a different conversation here.::
2637::$$$message_0022_0074_0000$$$::"Hey Illya. Let me ask something: Where do you live? It sounds like you came here just for the Holy Grail War. Does that mean you're living in a hotel right now?"::
2638::$$$message_0022_0075_0000$$$::Well, for starters, it'd be bad if she didn't have a guardian.[lr]::
2639::$$$message_0022_0075_0001$$$::Letting a child like her come to Japan on her own is just terrible parenting.::
2640::$$$message_0022_0076_0000$$$::"Hotel...? Like a vacation villa?"[lr]::
2641::$$$message_0022_0076_0001$$$::"Yeah, I guess so. Not a house, but just somewhere you stay."::
2642::$$$message_0022_0077_0000$$$::"Then yes! Do you see that big forest over there? There's a Western-style mansion my grandfather's grandfather built over there! I was told that the Einzbern family's Masters stay there for the Holy Grail War."::
2643::$$$message_0022_0078_0000$$$::Illya points west.[lr]::
2644::$$$message_0022_0078_0001$$$::Yeah, there's a deep forest in the mountains there. The place hasn't been developed yet.::
2645::$$$message_0022_0079_0000$$$::"It takes about an hour to get to that forest by car. Did you come all the way from there, alone?"::
2646::$$$message_0022_0080_0000$$$::"Yep. I snuck out today. Sella and Leysritt may be my maids, but they're sooo annoying.[lr]::
2647::$$$message_0022_0080_0001$$$::I came all the way to Japan, so I'd think I could go out and do some things. I may have always gotten what I wanted, but I've been shut in my room all this time, so this should be my reward."::
2648::$$$message_0022_0081_0000$$$::"Huh? You were locked up in your room?"[lr]::
2649::$$$message_0022_0081_0001$$$::"Yeah. I wasn't allowed outside when it snowed because it would be bad for my body. That's why I usually played in my room.[lr]::
2650::$$$message_0022_0081_0002$$$::But I'm fine. It's not as cold here as the castle, so I'm fine by myself."::
2651::$$$message_0022_0082_0000$$$::Illya beams proudly.[lr]::
2652::$$$message_0022_0082_0001$$$::She swings her legs back and forth, seeming to be genuinely enjoying herself.::
2653::$$$message_0022_0083_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
2654::$$$message_0022_0083_0001$$$::I find myself reaching into my grocery bag.[lr]::
2655::$$$message_0022_0083_0002$$$::I take out the [font italic=true]dorayaki[font italic=false], a Japanese pancake sandwich filled with red bean paste, I'd bought to give Saber, and without knowing why, I hand it to Illya.::
2656::$$$message_0022_0084_0000$$$::"Want it? It's not the fanciest thing, but it's good."[lr]::
2657::$$$message_0022_0084_0001$$$::"Eh? What's this? Food?"[lr]::
2658::$$$message_0022_0084_0002$$$::"Yeah. I'm not a big fan of sweets but this is the only exception. This was a favorite tea snack my old man and I shared."::
2659::$$$message_0022_0085_0000$$$::"Um...so...you're giving this to me?"::
2660::$$$message_0022_0086_0000$$$::"Yeah. It's not as good if you eat it alone, so let's eat it together."[lr]::
2661::$$$message_0022_0086_0001$$$::I hand her the [font italic=true]dorayaki[font italic=false].[lr]::
2662::$$$message_0022_0086_0002$$$::Illya hesitates, but takes the unfamiliar snack.::
2663::$$$message_0022_0087_0000$$$::"Teehee. Okay, thanks!"[lr]::
2664::$$$message_0022_0087_0001$$$::She happily takes a bite of the dorayaki.[lr]::
2665::$$$message_0022_0087_0002$$$::She practically devours the thing.::
2666::$$$message_0022_0088_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2667::$$$message_0022_0088_0001$$$::I nibble my [font italic=true]dorayaki[font italic=false] and try to hold stop myself from being overwhelmed by the shocking thought I've just had.[lr]::
2668::$$$message_0022_0088_0002$$$::I don't believe myself.[lr]::
2669::$$$message_0022_0088_0003$$$::For reasons I simply can't understand, I just found myself thinking it'd be nice to have a little sister like her.::
2670::$$$message_0022_0089_0000$$$::"But...honestly..."[lr]::
2671::$$$message_0022_0089_0001$$$::I think Illya is too innocent.[lr]::
2672::$$$message_0022_0089_0002$$$::She might really be an innocent young girl who hasn't learned the difference between good and evil.[lr]::
2673::$$$message_0022_0089_0003$$$::Honestly, I can't even begin to imagine how a mage family raises a child.[lr]::
2674::$$$message_0022_0089_0004$$$::But I know without a doubt that Illya wasn't raised in a normal environment.::
2675::$$$message_0022_0090_0000$$$::Tohsaka may act the way she does, but she is a mage at heart. She understands the gravity of the Holy Grail War and knows that the killings between Masters are murder.::
2676::$$$message_0022_0091_0000$$$::But this girl may have become a Master without really appreciating what it means to kill people.[lr]::
2677::$$$message_0022_0091_0001$$$::I haven't been talking to her long, but I don't think Illya's the sort who'd choose to kill anyone.[lr]::
2678::$$$message_0022_0091_0002$$$::If that's the case...::
2679::$$$message_0022_0092_0000$$$::"Illya. There's something serious I want to talk with you about."[lr]::
2680::$$$message_0022_0092_0001$$$::But then...[lr]::
2681::$$$message_0022_0092_0002$$$::Illya suddenly raises her head, as if someone's just called for her.::
2682::$$$message_0022_0093_0000$$$::"Illya? What's wrong? Did something happen?"[lr]::
2683::$$$message_0022_0093_0001$$$::"Yeah. I need to go home. Berserker woke up."::
2684::$$$message_0022_0094_0000$$$::She jumps off the bench.[lr]::
2685::$$$message_0022_0094_0001$$$::Illya runs out of the park without so much as a goodbye. She disappears in an instant.::
