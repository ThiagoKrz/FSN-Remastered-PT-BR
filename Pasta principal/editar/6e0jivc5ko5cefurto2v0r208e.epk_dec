22334::$$$message_0200_0000_0000$$$::Nothing changes in the afternoon.[lr]::
22335::$$$message_0200_0000_0001$$$::I take her to every shop I can think of, and Saber follows quietly.[lr]::
22336::$$$message_0200_0000_0002$$$::At least it's not as awkward as earlier in the morning.::
22337::$$$message_0200_0001_0000$$$::Either I'm getting used to the situation, or Saber's given up.[lr]::
22338::$$$message_0200_0001_0001$$$::She's still quiet, but the more I watch her, the more I notice she looks either angry...or not angry, which is really confusing.[lr]::
22339::$$$message_0200_0001_0002$$$::Whenever I see Saber coming out of a store looking excited, I feel this sense of accomplishment. It really makes me happy.::
22340::$$$message_0200_0002_0000$$$::   Then...[lr]::
22341::$$$message_0200_0002_0001$$$::...after a careful consideration of what Saber might like...::
22342::$$$message_0200_0003_0000$$$::...I'm not certain, but I determine this is the shop most likely to please Saber.::
22343::$$$message_0200_0004_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
22344::$$$message_0200_0004_0001$$$::Saber stands in front of the store, mouth agape.[lr]::
22345::$$$message_0200_0004_0002$$$::I'm not sure if her shoulders are trembling because she's angry or excited... I just can't tell.::
22346::$$$message_0200_0005_0000$$$::"Sh-Shirou...where are we?"[lr]::
22347::$$$message_0200_0005_0001$$$::"I hear this is the biggest stuffed animal shop in town. I've never been here, since men aren't allowed."::
22348::$$$message_0200_0006_0000$$$::Obviously, it's not that men aren't allowed in the store.[lr]::
22349::$$$message_0200_0006_0001$$$::It's just that most of the customer base are girls, so there's this unspoken rule about men not going inside.[lr]::
22350::$$$message_0200_0006_0002$$$::Besides, there are only girls in the store right now.::
22351::$$$message_0200_0007_0000$$$::Saber, with her beautiful blonde hair is drawing attention, while I'm drawing glares for being a guy.[lr]::
22352::$$$message_0200_0007_0001$$$::They must all be trying to keep me out of their sanctuary.[lr]::
22353::$$$message_0200_0007_0002$$$::And I can't agree more.[lr]::
22354::$$$message_0200_0007_0003$$$::Even I don't think guys should be in a store like this.::
22355::$$$message_0200_0008_0000$$$::"Well, we've come all the way here, so don't hold back. Let's take a look around. Do you have a favorite animal, Saber?"::
22356::$$$message_0200_0009_0000$$$::"Uh...well. I suppose I find lions and leopards to be quite lovely... Do you find that strange?"::
22357::$$$message_0200_0010_0000$$$::"Uh..."[lr]::
22358::$$$message_0200_0010_0001$$$::I find myself turning away and fighting not to laugh.[lr]::
22359::$$$message_0200_0010_0002$$$::I'm not sure why Saber liking lions is strange.::
22360::$$$message_0200_0011_0000$$$::"Shirou. Your reaction does not seem right. It fills me with an inexplicable sense of rage... Or is it my imagination?"::
22361::$$$message_0200_0012_0000$$$::"Uh, no...sorry. I couldn't help but laugh. A lion is just so perfect for you."::
22362::$$$message_0200_0013_0000$$$::"What!? I-it is not right to laugh at someone's preferences, Shirou! And there is nothing wrong with lions!"[lr]::
22363::$$$message_0200_0013_0001$$$::"And I said I'm sorry. To make it up to you, I'll take you somewhere good, so don't get mad."::
22364::$$$message_0200_0014_0000$$$::I try to fight down my laughter and walk in to the store.[lr]::
22365::$$$message_0200_0014_0001$$$::Let's see...looks like animal stuffed toys are over there.::
22366::$$$message_0200_0015_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
22367::$$$message_0200_0015_0001$$$::It takes about an hour to get from one end of the store to the other.[lr]::
22368::$$$message_0200_0015_0002$$$::I watch in silence as Saber stares at the stuffed animals while I worry about the dozen or so sets of prying eyes staring at me from around the store... I've never been so exhausted in my life as I am today.::
22369::$$$message_0200_0016_0000$$$::The terrifying thing is that we've only made it through half of the store.[lr]::
22370::$$$message_0200_0016_0001$$$::Saber frequently is paralyzed...that is, she often stops and stares at a stuffed animal. Even after all this time, we're only halfway through the store.[lr]::
22371::$$$message_0200_0016_0002$$$::Saber seems very interested in the other half of the store, so I guess I'll just hang around while she does what she wants here.::
22372::$$$message_0200_0017_0000$$$::"Shirou? Why are you sighing? Are you tired from walking so much?"::
22373::$$$message_0200_0018_0000$$$::"Hmmm? Yeah, I'm just a little tired. I usually don't get tired so easily, but today's special. I guess I should be careful about doing things I'm not used to doing."::
22374::$$$message_0200_0019_0000$$$::I heave a sigh.[lr]::
22375::$$$message_0200_0019_0001$$$::I don't mind people staring at us when we're just walking around, but I'm uncomfortable with it when we're in this girly shop.[lr]::
22376::$$$message_0200_0019_0002$$$::When you're mentally drained, the first part of your body that feels it is your legs.::
22377::$$$message_0200_0020_0000$$$::"What about you, Saber? This must be your first time in a store like this. Let me know if you get tired."::
22378::$$$message_0200_0021_0000$$$::"Yes, I am a little uncomfortable, but you look far more so. Not only here. You did not seem comfortable in the previous shop, or the one before that...[lr]::
22379::$$$message_0200_0021_0001$$$::I hope you are not selecting places you do not wish to go?"::
22380::$$$message_0200_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22381::$$$message_0200_0022_0001$$$::Suddenly...[lr]::
22382::$$$message_0200_0022_0002$$$::Those words dispel all the worries and mental exhaustion I felt earlier.::
22383::$$$message_0200_0023_0000$$$::"Yeah. Honestly, I might have chosen a bunch of places I wouldn't normally go."::
22384::$$$message_0200_0024_0000$$$::"I knew it. That is ridiculous, Shirou. You are aware of your own dislike, so why would you purposefully go there? You will..."::
22385::$$$message_0200_0025_0000$$$::"It's the sort of place girls like, right?[lr]::
22386::$$$message_0200_0025_0001$$$::I was the one who made you come out with me, and it's your day."::
22387::$$$message_0200_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22388::$$$message_0200_0026_0001$$$::"Besides, it's not so bad, since you're with me. I'm with a beautiful girl, so I don't look completely out of place...all the stares directed at me aside."::
22389::$$$message_0200_0027_0000$$$::"Th-that is absurd! I may not be armed, but I am still a Servant. Even if I am not fighting, you need not treat me like a woman. You must treat me as a Servant, like always."::
22390::$$$message_0200_0028_0000$$$::"You're the one being absurd. You [font italic=true]are[font italic=false] a girl. I'm not trying to treat you differently today... Unless you feel like I am."::
22391::$$$message_0200_0029_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
22392::$$$message_0200_0029_0001$$$::She's bewildered.[lr]::
22393::$$$message_0200_0029_0002$$$::Saber's mouth hangs open, as if she's only just now realizing this.::
22394::$$$message_0200_0030_0000$$$::"No, you are the same.[lr]::
22395::$$$message_0200_0030_0001$$$::You are acting the same as you always do."[lr]::
22396::$$$message_0200_0030_0002$$$::"See? No need to worry about me.[lr]::
22397::$$$message_0200_0030_0003$$$::So let's keep going. If we're going to buy your favorite thing in here, we still have to see the other half of the store."::
22398::$$$message_0200_0031_0000$$$::I take Saber's hand.[lr]::
22399::$$$message_0200_0031_0001$$$::She offers no objection as I tug her along.[lr]::
22400::$$$message_0200_0031_0002$$$::"Oh, that is right. It has always been like this. I do not know why I'm realizing this now..."[lr]::
22401::$$$message_0200_0031_0003$$$::She murmurs to herself, sounding dazed.::m
