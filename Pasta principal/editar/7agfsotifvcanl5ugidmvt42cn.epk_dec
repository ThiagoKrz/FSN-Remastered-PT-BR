45682::$$$message_0406_0000_0000$$$::                               Before that, there's just one more conversation.::
45683::$$$message_0406_0001_0000$$$::When they get out of the forest and day breaks...[lr]::
45684::$$$message_0406_0001_0001$$$::Before they head to the church, the girl tells him the fact that she kept hidden.::
45685::$$$message_0406_0002_0000$$$::"I'll tell you this now, but the pendant that you gave back to me is one of a kind."[lr]::
45686::$$$message_0406_0002_0001$$$::She doesn't say what that means, and he doesn't pursue it further.[lr]::
45687::$$$message_0406_0002_0002$$$::That is because that is an unnecessary matter when they are about to fight their biggest enemy... Caster.::
45688::$$$message_0406_0003_0000$$$::                      Only one pendant.[lr]::
45689::$$$message_0406_0003_0001$$$::                      The one that he found in her room and returned to her.[lr]::
45690::$$$message_0406_0003_0002$$$::                      The one that he picked up that night and put into his desk.[lr]::
45691::$$$message_0406_0003_0003$$$::                      Now is not the time to be pursuing that contradiction.::
45692::$$$message_0406_0004_0000$$$::"...That's all I have to say.[lr]::
45693::$$$message_0406_0004_0001$$$::The pendant that you found in my room is something Archer returned to me on the day you were stabbed by Lancer.[lr]::
45694::$$$message_0406_0004_0002$$$::I just assumed that was something that he picked up."::
45695::$$$message_0406_0005_0000$$$::   The decisive battle is near.[lr]::
45696::$$$message_0406_0005_0001$$$::   The roof of the tall church can be seen in the corner, when looking up at the sky.::
45697::$$$message_0406_0006_0000$$$::Tohsaka says she wants to confirm things one last time.[lr]::
45698::$$$message_0406_0006_0001$$$::Our roles are decided.[lr]::
45699::$$$message_0406_0006_0002$$$::Lancer will draw Archer and Saber away from Caster.[lr]::
45700::$$$message_0406_0006_0003$$$::We will use that opening to fight Caster.::
45701::$$$message_0406_0007_0000$$$::In response to Lancer sarcastically asking if we'd be able to defeat Caster...[lr]::
45702::$$$message_0406_0007_0001$$$::"...Yeah. I think I can outwit Caster if I can fight her one-on-one."[lr]::
45703::$$$message_0406_0007_0002$$$::Tohsaka replies with confidence.::
45704::$$$message_0406_0008_0000$$$::...I don't know what she means by outwitting her.[lr]::
45705::$$$message_0406_0008_0001$$$::She wouldn't tell us even if we asked, so it must be a strategy that has a lower success rate if she tells her allies.::
45706::$$$message_0406_0009_0000$$$::Then, all I need to do is fulfill Tohsaka's demands.[lr]::
45707::$$$message_0406_0009_0001$$$::I will keep Kuzuki from protecting Caster no matter what.[lr]::
45708::$$$message_0406_0009_0002$$$::I'll Project his swords however many times is necessary to do that.::
45709::$$$message_0406_0010_0000$$$::...I close my eyes and dive inside myself.[lr]::
45710::$$$message_0406_0010_0001$$$::The Magic Circuit that flows inside me is stable.[lr]::
45711::$$$message_0406_0010_0002$$$::   Magecraft beyond one's capacity will destroy the user themselves.[lr]::
45712::$$$message_0406_0010_0003$$$::The first time, half of my body went numb.[lr]::
45713::$$$message_0406_0010_0004$$$::The second time's Projection was surprisingly easy and had no effect on my body.[lr]::
45714::$$$message_0406_0010_0005$$$::There's no guarantee that the third time will be the same, but I think there should be no problem if it's just copying his swords.::
45715::$$$message_0406_0011_0000$$$::My body is stable.[lr]::
45716::$$$message_0406_0011_0001$$$::Through sheer awareness alone, I have access to the Magic Circuits that were so difficult to create before.[lr]::
45717::$$$message_0406_0011_0002$$$::It's like there's a fake nerve behind my normal nerve, and I'm able to reverse them with just the press of a button.[lr]::
45718::$$$message_0406_0011_0003$$$::There's part of me that wants to believe it's because I got used to it.::
45719::$$$message_0406_0012_0000$$$::   I can easily prepare the swords.[lr]::
45720::$$$message_0406_0012_0001$$$::Projection has become my primary weapon.[lr]::
45721::$$$message_0406_0012_0002$$$::It's improved greatly compared to ten days ago.[lr]::
45722::$$$message_0406_0012_0003$$$::Not only has the control of my Magic Circuits improved, but even my sword technique has improved.::
45723::$$$message_0406_0013_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
45724::$$$message_0406_0013_0001$$$::The reason behind it...[lr]::
45725::$$$message_0406_0013_0002$$$::I stop myself from thinking about the reason.[lr]::
45726::$$$message_0406_0013_0003$$$::It's top priority to defeat Caster and get Saber back.::
45727::$$$message_0406_0014_0000$$$::Asking myself stupid questions can come after the battle.[lr]::
45728::$$$message_0406_0014_0001$$$::My headache gets worse the closer I get to the church.[lr]::
45729::$$$message_0406_0014_0002$$$::It's just like when I was looking for Tohsaka, but I stop thinking about that.::
45730::$$$message_0406_0015_0000$$$::The sunrise is gray.[lr]::
45731::$$$message_0406_0015_0001$$$::The sunlight is blocked by the clouds, sealing the dawn's brightness.[lr]::
45732::$$$message_0406_0015_0002$$$::The sky above is cloudy.[lr]::
45733::$$$message_0406_0015_0003$$$::The sky is closer to black than gray and reminds me of that time ten years ago.::
45734::$$$message_0406_0016_0000$$$::   Is it going to start raining soon?[lr]::
45735::$$$message_0406_0016_0001$$$::A dull white sky.[lr]::
45736::$$$message_0406_0016_0002$$$::That man was standing under the cloudy sky that smelled like it had just stopped raining.::
45737::$$$message_0406_0017_0000$$$::"I knew you would come."[lr]::
45738::$$$message_0406_0017_0001$$$::He stares at Tohsaka with cool eyes.[lr]::
45739::$$$message_0406_0017_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45740::$$$message_0406_0017_0003$$$::Tohsaka doesn't say anything and stares back at Archer.::
45741::$$$message_0406_0018_0000$$$::"So, what is the plan you've prepared? You're not the type to challenge someone without one."[lr]::
45742::$$$message_0406_0018_0001$$$::"Yeah. You're fighting me."::
45743::$$$message_0406_0019_0000$$$::"I'm surprised. It's only been a few days since you lost me, and you already made a contract with a new Servant?[lr]::
45744::$$$message_0406_0019_0001$$$::Good grief. I'm not one to talk, but you're quite fickle. Maybe cutting ties with you was the right thing to do."[lr]::
45745::$$$message_0406_0019_0002$$$::"Ugh[line2]!"::
45746::$$$message_0406_0020_0000$$$::"...It's fine, Shirou. Don't let him provoke you."[lr]::
45747::$$$message_0406_0020_0001$$$::She stops me, still staring at Archer.[lr]::
45748::$$$message_0406_0020_0002$$$::...But, it's obvious looking at her face.[lr]::
45749::$$$message_0406_0020_0003$$$::Even if she knows he's provoking her, it doesn't change the fact that those words hurt for Tohsaka.::
45750::$$$message_0406_0021_0000$$$::"...Heh. I didn't like you from the start, but...it seems you're rotten to your core."::
45751::$$$message_0406_0022_0000$$$::"Oh. Does betrayal get on your nerves, Lancer? You're not even the one who got betrayed. How faithful of you."[lr]::
45752::$$$message_0406_0022_0001$$$::"...I'm not supporting the young lady.[lr]::
45753::$$$message_0406_0022_0002$$$::I just don't like how there are Servants like you."::
45754::$$$message_0406_0023_0000$$$::"A hero's pride, huh? Geez, everyone says the same thing.[lr]::
45755::$$$message_0406_0023_0001$$$::Even that Caster had such a ridiculous thing. What honor do you have to protect when you're dead?[lr]::
45756::$$$message_0406_0023_0002$$$::To be honest, I can't understand how you people think."::
45757::$$$message_0406_0024_0000$$$::"Yeah, you don't have to. I'll save you the trouble."::
45758::$$$message_0406_0025_0000$$$::   Conversation ceases between the two of them.[lr]::
45759::$$$message_0406_0025_0001$$$::All that's left is Lancer's sharp intent to kill,[lr]::
45760::$$$message_0406_0025_0002$$$::and Archer's calm intent to kill.::
45761::$$$message_0406_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45762::$$$message_0406_0026_0001$$$::...They are about ten meters apart.[lr]::
45763::$$$message_0406_0026_0002$$$::The knight in red and knight in blue confronting each other is like a reenactment of that night.::
45764::$$$message_0406_0027_0000$$$::"Lancer."[lr]::
45765::$$$message_0406_0027_0001$$$::Tohsaka calls to the blue back.::
45766::$$$message_0406_0028_0000$$$::"You two go inside. I'll catch up once I beat this guy."[lr]::
45767::$$$message_0406_0028_0001$$$::"...I know. But Lancer, Archer is[line2]"[lr]::
45768::$$$message_0406_0028_0002$$$::"Yeah, I'll go easy on him. I need for him to get on his knees and apologize to you."[lr]::
45769::$$$message_0406_0028_0003$$$::Without looking back, he smiles while still staring at Archer.::
45770::$$$message_0406_0029_0000$$$::"...Thanks.[lr]::
45771::$$$message_0406_0029_0001$$$::I'm glad you're the one who came to help us."::
45772::$$$message_0406_0030_0000$$$::We go around the two and run to the church.[lr]::
45773::$$$message_0406_0030_0001$$$::Archer, the guard, casually lets us go through.[lr]::
45774::$$$message_0406_0030_0002$$$::No, he had to let us through.::
45775::$$$message_0406_0031_0000$$$::Archer is already confronting Lancer.[lr]::
45776::$$$message_0406_0031_0001$$$::If he gave us attention in such a situation, he would get stabbed in the chest by Lancer the next moment.[lr]::
45777::$$$message_0406_0031_0002$$$::Either he doesn't let us go but gets attacked by Lancer, or he lets us go but confronts Lancer.[lr]::
45778::$$$message_0406_0031_0003$$$::   If he is really guarding this place, the choice should be obvious.::
45779::$$$message_0406_0032_0000$$$::We run around the courtyard and open the door to the church without hesitation.[lr]::
45780::$$$message_0406_0032_0001$$$::Behind us...::
45781::$$$message_0406_0033_0000$$$::"...Geez. This is troublesome."[lr]::
45782::$$$message_0406_0033_0001$$$::"What is, Lancer?"[lr]::
45783::$$$message_0406_0033_0002$$$::"Well, I can't go easy after she thanks me like that.[lr]::
45784::$$$message_0406_0033_0003$$$::That's troubling, right? She's a great Master, but I'm not one who is able to betray my Master readily."::
45785::$$$message_0406_0034_0000$$$::"...You are rather na√Øve, Lancer. Do you know the saying 'the grass is always greener on the other side?'"[lr]::
45786::$$$message_0406_0034_0001$$$::"Heh, what are you saying?[lr]::
45787::$$$message_0406_0034_0002$$$::Of course not...!"::„
