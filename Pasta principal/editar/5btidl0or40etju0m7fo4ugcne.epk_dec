57729::$$$message_0513_0000_0000$$$::After school, the campus dies down.[lr]::
57730::$$$message_0513_0000_0001$$$::The classrooms empty, with students either going home or to their respective clubs, like baby spiders scattering from the nest.::
57731::$$$message_0513_0001_0000$$$::"...Okay. I'd better get home early."[lr]::
57732::$$$message_0513_0001_0001$$$::I need to mentally prepare to have Sakura stay over, too.[lr]::
57733::$$$message_0513_0001_0002$$$::I'll do my dinner shopping first, then break the news once Sakura comes back from club practice.::
57734::$$$message_0513_0002_0000$$$::"Let's see, what should I make tonight...?"[lr]::
57735::$$$message_0513_0002_0001$$$::Arms folded, I pause to think in front of Toyoetsu, the local supermarket.[lr]::
57736::$$$message_0513_0002_0002$$$::If I want Sakura to stay over, I'll have to convince Fuji-nee.[lr]::
57737::$$$message_0513_0002_0003$$$::Meaning that I should think of a way to make them both happy...::
57738::$$$message_0513_0003_0000$$$::"I splurged pretty hard yesterday, and I'm taking time off from work, plus there's another mouth to feed...so the budget's a little tight."::
57739::$$$message_0513_0004_0000$$$::Still, I can make an exception this month.[lr]::
57740::$$$message_0513_0004_0001$$$::I do have savings, and I can't fight the Holy Grail War if I'm worried about living expenses.[lr]::
57741::$$$message_0513_0004_0002$$$::I can just think of it as a way to repay Sakura for everything she's done.::
57742::$$$message_0513_0005_0000$$$::"And...there."[lr]::
57743::$$$message_0513_0005_0001$$$::With a bag full of ingredients, I leave Toyoetsu.[lr]::
57744::$$$message_0513_0005_0002$$$::Usually I'm against overspending, though in this case the bounty was good.[lr]::
57745::$$$message_0513_0005_0003$$$::I managed to get my hands on some high-grade Pacific cod, which could go well in a stew tonight.::
57746::$$$message_0513_0006_0000$$$::"That should make Fuji-nee happy[line2]Hm?"[lr]::
57747::$$$message_0513_0006_0001$$$::While walking home in high spirits, I stop in my tracks.[lr]::
57748::$$$message_0513_0006_0002$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
57749::$$$message_0513_0006_0003$$$::Something's pulling on my clothes from behind me.::
57750::$$$message_0513_0007_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
57751::$$$message_0513_0007_0001$$$::I turn around curiously.[lr]::
57752::$$$message_0513_0007_0002$$$::I'm met by the sight of[lr]::
57753::$$$message_0513_0007_0003$$$::a young girl with silver hair.::
57754::$$$message_0513_0008_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]eh!?"[lr]::
57755::$$$message_0513_0008_0001$$$::I leap backwards with a yelp.[lr]::
57756::$$$message_0513_0008_0002$$$::The girl just watches as I panic.::
57757::$$$message_0513_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]The hell...?[font italic=false][lr]::
57758::$$$message_0513_0009_0001$$$::She doesn't seem hostile, much less murderous.[lr]::
57759::$$$message_0513_0009_0002$$$::Instead, she says,[lr]::
57760::$$$message_0513_0009_0003$$$::"I'm glad you're alive, big brother."[lr]::
57761::$$$message_0513_0009_0004$$$::She beams at me in genuine joy.::
57762::$$$message_0513_0010_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
57763::$$$message_0513_0010_0001$$$::...There's no mistake that this is Berserker's Master.[lr]::
57764::$$$message_0513_0010_0002$$$::She commands that monster that nearly tore me in half with a single slash that night.[lr]::
57765::$$$message_0513_0010_0003$$$::She's from an ancient magical lineage that founded the Holy Grail War. One my old man Kiritsugu betrayed.[lr]::
57766::$$$message_0513_0010_0004$$$::But what's she doing out here in the middle of the day?::
57767::$$$message_0513_0011_0000$$$::...With Father Kotomine's words still fresh in my mind, she's no longer just a stranger to me.[lr]::
57768::$$$message_0513_0011_0001$$$::That's why, without thinking, I murmur,[lr]::
57769::$$$message_0513_0011_0002$$$::"Ill...ya?"[lr]::
57770::$$$message_0513_0011_0003$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
57771::$$$message_0513_0011_0004$$$::Without knowing the significance of it, I blurt out the girl's name.::
57772::$$$message_0513_0012_0000$$$::"Ah[line2]no, I mean...![lr]::
57773::$$$message_0513_0012_0001$$$::Illyas[line2]yeah, you're Illyasviel![lr]::
57774::$$$message_0513_0012_0002$$$::S-sorry I got your name wrong!"::
57775::$$$message_0513_0013_0000$$$::I bow out of reflex.[lr]::
57776::$$$message_0513_0013_0001$$$::It doesn't matter whether she's Berserker's Master or the daughter of the Einzberns right now.[lr]::
57777::$$$message_0513_0013_0002$$$::I...just...[lr]::
57778::$$$message_0513_0013_0003$$$::...can't leave her alone, not when she looks like she's about to cry.::
57779::$$$message_0513_0014_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
57780::$$$message_0513_0014_0001$$$::"Ah, uh, I didn't mean anything bad by it. I just thought of your name, and..."::
57781::$$$message_0513_0015_0000$$$::"...What's your name?"[lr]::
57782::$$$message_0513_0015_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
57783::$$$message_0513_0015_0002$$$::"Tell me your name. It isn't fair that only you know mine."[lr]::
57784::$$$message_0513_0015_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57785::$$$message_0513_0015_0004$$$::That's right, come to think of it.[lr]::
57786::$$$message_0513_0015_0005$$$::Illyasviel introduced herself before, but I still haven't told her my name.::
57787::$$$message_0513_0016_0000$$$::"I'm Shirou. Shirou Emiya."[lr]::
57788::$$$message_0513_0016_0001$$$::"Zero Emilia? That's a weird name."[lr]::
57789::$$$message_0513_0016_0002$$$::"No, that's wrong. It doesn't sound like Western names. You pronounce it she-row eh-me-yah. Just call me Shirou if it's easier that way for you."[lr]::
57790::$$$message_0513_0016_0003$$$::Without really thinking about it, I correct the girl's lilted pronunciation.::
57791::$$$message_0513_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57792::$$$message_0513_0017_0001$$$::I even wag a finger at her, which makes her blink in surprise.::
57793::$$$message_0513_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57794::$$$message_0513_0018_0001$$$::By the time I realize how blunt I'm being, it's too late.[lr]::
57795::$$$message_0513_0018_0002$$$::Once again, she looks like she's about to cry.[r]::
57796::$$$message_0513_0018_0003$$$::"...Shirou. Shirou, huh? Okay, I like that.[lr]::
57797::$$$message_0513_0018_0004$$$::It's simple, but it has a nice ring to it. Shirou suits you.[lr]::
57798::$$$message_0513_0018_0005$$$::I'll let you off for being rude earlier!"[lr]::
57799::$$$message_0513_0018_0006$$$::Suddenly, she grabs my arm.::
57800::$$$message_0513_0019_0000$$$::"Whoa! H-h-hold on, Illyasviel! What're you doing!?"[lr]::
57801::$$$message_0513_0019_0001$$$::"It's okay, you can keep calling me Illya, Shirou! I'll call you Shirou, so we're even!"::
57802::$$$message_0513_0020_0000$$$::"Wha... I mean, sure, that's easier to say, but wait!"[lr]::
57803::$$$message_0513_0020_0001$$$::I try to shake Illya off my arm, but she just squeals in delight.::
57804::$$$message_0513_0021_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
57805::$$$message_0513_0021_0001$$$::Uh-oh. At this rate, the neighborhood mother hens will start to gossip.::
57806::$$$message_0513_0022_0000$$$::"Damn it, what are you after!? Are you trying to hunt me down in broad daylight!?"[lr]::
57807::$$$message_0513_0022_0001$$$::I finally wrench my arm out of her grasp.[lr]::
57808::$$$message_0513_0022_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57809::$$$message_0513_0022_0003$$$::...Ah.[lr]::
57810::$$$message_0513_0022_0004$$$::Illya looks unhappy.::
57811::$$$message_0513_0023_0000$$$::"W-what? Don't look at me like that. I don't know what you're doing here, but I'm a Master, too."[lr]::
57812::$$$message_0513_0023_0001$$$::Illya shoots a glance at the shopping bag in my hand.[lr]::
57813::$$$message_0513_0023_0002$$$::...But she also keeps looking at me curiously.::
57814::$$$message_0513_0024_0000$$$::"...Um, Illya?"[lr]::
57815::$$$message_0513_0024_0001$$$::"Yeah? What is it, Shirou?"[lr]::
57816::$$$message_0513_0024_0002$$$::"Urgh."::
57817::$$$message_0513_0025_0000$$$::She's, um, not how I imagined.[lr]::
57818::$$$message_0513_0025_0001$$$::...She laughed back then, too, but the feeling behind it was different, like maybe...[lr]::
57819::$$$message_0513_0025_0002$$$::"...Illya. Did you not come here to fight?"::
57820::$$$message_0513_0026_0000$$$::"Why? Do you want me to kill you?"[lr]::
57821::$$$message_0513_0026_0001$$$::"Nnn..."[lr]::
57822::$$$message_0513_0026_0002$$$::Her gaze is enough to make my hair stand on end.[lr]::
57823::$$$message_0513_0026_0003$$$::No matter how young she looks, this girl is the strongest Master.[lr]::
57824::$$$message_0513_0026_0004$$$::She might be giggling innocently one second, and become a ruthless Master the next.::
57825::$$$message_0513_0027_0000$$$::"...Hmm. I don't understand, but I'm fine with it if that's what you want. It'll just move up my schedule a little. Would you like to die here with Saber?"[lr]::
57826::$$$message_0513_0027_0001$$$::"...Stop joking, of course not. I don't want to die, and I'd rather not fight here."::
57827::$$$message_0513_0028_0000$$$::"Right? Masters aren't supposed to fight while it's light out. You didn't bring Saber with you, and I didn't bring Berserker either."::
57828::$$$message_0513_0029_0000$$$::"...Well, yeah. So what are you doing here? Did we just run into each other by chance?"[lr]::
57829::$$$message_0513_0029_0001$$$::"Not by chance. I snuck away from Sella and came here to meet you. You should be honored."::
57830::$$$message_0513_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57831::$$$message_0513_0030_0001$$$::I think I'm getting dizzy.[lr]::
57832::$$$message_0513_0030_0002$$$::Just when I thought she was in serious Master mode, she's back to being an innocent child.[lr]::
57833::$$$message_0513_0030_0003$$$::I have no way of knowing which side is the real Illya.::
57834::$$$message_0513_0031_0000$$$::"...Fine. So you're here to see me.[lr]::
57835::$$$message_0513_0031_0001$$$::But you're not here to fight...is that really okay?"[lr]::
57836::$$$message_0513_0031_0002$$$::"Yeah. I'm here to talk to you, Shirou. You'll at least do that, right? I've been waiting such a long time."[lr]::
57837::$$$message_0513_0031_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57838::$$$message_0513_0031_0004$$$::I don't know what she means by "at least," but apparently she really is just here to talk.::
57839::$$$message_0513_0032_0000$$$::"Or do you not want to talk? ...If not, I'll just go home. I don't want to, but I don't like forcing people to do things."[lr]::
57840::$$$message_0513_0032_0001$$$::Illya gazes up into my eyes.::
57841::$$$message_0513_0033_0000$$$::"Ergh."[lr]::
57842::$$$message_0513_0033_0001$$$::...As a Master, it's dangerous to stay here with Illya any longer. If Saber were here, I'm sure she'd be vehemently against this course of action.::
57843::$$$message_0513_0034_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57844::$$$message_0513_0034_0001$$$::...But I can't just leave, not when she's looking at me like that.[lr]::
57845::$$$message_0513_0034_0002$$$::I know it's heedless, haphazard, and half-cocked, but...::
57846::$$$message_0513_0035_0000$$$::"I'm not against talking to you, Illya. To be honest, I've wanted to meet you, too."::
57847::$$$message_0513_0036_0000$$$::"Yay! Then come this way! I found a small park earlier!"[lr]::
57848::$$$message_0513_0036_0001$$$::As soon as I agree, Illya starts running, practically dancing in delight.::
57849::$$$message_0513_0037_0000$$$::"Come on, hurry, or I'll leave you behind, Shirou!"::
57850::$$$message_0513_0038_0000$$$::"I guess whatever happens, happens."[lr]::
57851::$$$message_0513_0038_0001$$$::Resigning myself to my fate, I follow after her.[lr]::
57852::$$$message_0513_0038_0002$$$::Illya called me Shirou.[lr]::
57853::$$$message_0513_0038_0003$$$::That means I should deal with her in kind, not as a Master, but a regular girl.::
57854::$$$message_0513_0039_0000$$$::There's no one else at the park.[lr]::
57855::$$$message_0513_0039_0001$$$::Not in the sandbox, nor on the swings.[lr]::
57856::$$$message_0513_0039_0002$$$::It feels lonely. I sit down on a bench with Illya.::
57857::$$$message_0513_0040_0000$$$::...We must look like an odd pair.[lr]::
57858::$$$message_0513_0040_0001$$$::Illya's clearly not my sister since she's obviously foreign, but we have too much of an age gap to look like friends.::
57859::$$$message_0513_0041_0000$$$::"So, what did you want to talk about, Illya? You must have something to ask me."::
57860::$$$message_0513_0042_0000$$$::"Why? I don't really have any questions for you."[lr]::
57861::$$$message_0513_0042_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57862::$$$message_0513_0042_0002$$$::Well, then.[lr]::
57863::$$$message_0513_0042_0003$$$::How am I supposed to answer that, inscrutable little lady?::
57864::$$$message_0513_0043_0000$$$::"...Illya. You're the one who said you wanted to talk.[lr]::
57865::$$$message_0513_0043_0001$$$::But now you're saying there's nothing to talk about. Normally you wouldn't invite someone for a chat without business."[lr]::
57866::$$$message_0513_0043_0002$$$::"Huh? R-really? We can't talk unless it's business...?"::
57867::$$$message_0513_0044_0000$$$::"Ahh... That's not what I meant. I phrased that badly. We don't need to talk about business. Actually, it's more fun that way.[lr]::
57868::$$$message_0513_0044_0001$$$::...But you've got me at a loss. I don't know you well, so I'm not sure what we should talk about. I don't know your likes or dislikes. That goes for you too, doesn't it? Wouldn't you feel uncomfortable if I suddenly asked you about things you wouldn't wanna talk about?"::
57869::$$$message_0513_0045_0000$$$::"Mm... Yeah, maybe...but then what should I ask you? You won't get mad if I ask you anything I want?"[lr]::
57870::$$$message_0513_0045_0001$$$::"Yeah, probably not. I'm the big brother here, so I'll try to act like a grown-up."[lr]::
57871::$$$message_0513_0045_0002$$$::"Okay. Then, Shirou...do you like me?"::
57872::$$$message_0513_0046_0000$$$::"Pfft!"[lr]::
57873::$$$message_0513_0046_0001$$$::W-w-what does this kid think she's asking!?::
57874::$$$message_0513_0047_0000$$$::"Ah, you're a liar. You said you wouldn't get mad, Shirou!"[lr]::
57875::$$$message_0513_0047_0001$$$::"Anyone would be shocked by that, stupid! Y-you cut me in half, you know! I don't even know how to feel about that!"::
57876::$$$message_0513_0048_0000$$$::"That's not how it happened! You're the one who ran out in front even though you're so weak! I-it wasn't my fault!"::
57877::$$$message_0513_0049_0000$$$::"The hell it wasn't! You showed up all ready to murder us! That's insane! And why does it matter whether I like you or not!?"[lr]::
57878::$$$message_0513_0049_0001$$$::Illya's shoulders tremble, and she goes silent.::
57879::$$$message_0513_0050_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
57880::$$$message_0513_0050_0001$$$::...Oops.[lr]::
57881::$$$message_0513_0050_0002$$$::I made up my mind to forget we're Masters, and here I am putting my foot in my mouth.::
57882::$$$message_0513_0051_0000$$$::"Uh... Illya?"[lr]::
57883::$$$message_0513_0051_0001$$$::"...Well, it matters to me. You're a jerk, Shirou, and you're all talk. You would've died if I didn't stop him."[lr]::
57884::$$$message_0513_0051_0002$$$::Illya's shoulders shake and she stares at the ground, even as she says something ominous.::
57885::$$$message_0513_0052_0000$$$::"...Ugh."[lr]::
57886::$$$message_0513_0052_0001$$$::...Well, she's got me there.[lr]::
57887::$$$message_0513_0052_0002$$$::I'm the one who steered the conversation this way, and I'm older. Illya's just a kid.::
57888::$$$message_0513_0053_0000$$$::"Ahem. Well, about that..."[lr]::
57889::$$$message_0513_0053_0001$$$::I make up my mind and decide to say it.[lr]::
57890::$$$message_0513_0053_0002$$$::I say...[lr]::
