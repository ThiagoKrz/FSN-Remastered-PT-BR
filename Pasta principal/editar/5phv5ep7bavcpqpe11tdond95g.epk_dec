63130::$$$message_0581_0000_0000$$$::After that...[lr]::
63131::$$$message_0581_0000_0001$$$::I ask Tohsaka why we're here in the dojo.::
63132::$$$message_0581_0001_0000$$$::"Right. First, I need you to strip naked.[lr]::
63133::$$$message_0581_0001_0001$$$::This isn't going to work unless I see exactly how your body has changed."[lr]::
63134::$$$message_0581_0001_0002$$$::And she gives me an outrageous answer.::
63135::$$$message_0581_0002_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
63136::$$$message_0581_0002_0001$$$::"W-whaaaat!?"[lr]::
63137::$$$message_0581_0002_0002$$$::"Whaaaat!?"::
63138::$$$message_0581_0003_0000$$$::"What are you so surprised for, Sakura?"[lr]::
63139::$$$message_0581_0003_0001$$$::"O-of course I'm surprised! What are you thinking, asking him to strip!?"::
63140::$$$message_0581_0004_0000$$$::"I'm thinking about Shirou, obviously.[lr]::
63141::$$$message_0581_0004_0001$$$::You're in danger, but he's in just as much danger. You know that he'll be in trouble unless we take some measures."[lr]::
63142::$$$message_0581_0004_0002$$$::"...I know, but..."::
63143::$$$message_0581_0005_0000$$$::"If you do, then stop interrupting.[lr]::
63144::$$$message_0581_0005_0001$$$::Come on, you! Stop spacing out and take off that shirt! I'm going to apply a Sign of evil-warding, but I can't do that with your clothes on!"[lr]::
63145::$$$message_0581_0005_0002$$$::Tohsaka glares daggers at me.::
63146::$$$message_0581_0006_0000$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
63147::$$$message_0581_0006_0001$$$::But Sakura's gaze is just as painful.[lr]::
63148::$$$message_0581_0006_0002$$$::It's like her anxious eyes are asking me if I'm going to go over to her sister.::
63149::$$$message_0581_0007_0000$$$::"Hurry up. Your body needs time to acclimate to it before we go out on patrol."[lr]::
63150::$$$message_0581_0007_0001$$$::"Ugh... okay."::
63151::$$$message_0581_0008_0000$$$::The situation is too serious to worry about feeling ashamed.[lr]::
63152::$$$message_0581_0008_0001$$$::I don't want to get naked, but taking off my shirt is just like changing clothes, so it's no big deal.::
63153::$$$message_0581_0009_0000$$$::"...Haah. I took off my shirt, Tohsaka. Now what?"[lr]::
63154::$$$message_0581_0009_0001$$$::"Come here. I'm going to use just a little bit of my Magic Crest."[lr]::
63155::$$$message_0581_0009_0002$$$::"...Over to you!? Looking like this!?"::
63156::$$$message_0581_0010_0000$$$::"Of course. I'm going to touch you with my left hand, gauge your physical condition, and then inscribe a ward against evil on you. It might tickle or hurt, but I need you to bear with it."[lr]::
63157::$$$message_0581_0010_0001$$$::She beckons me over.::
63158::$$$message_0581_0011_0000$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
63159::$$$message_0581_0011_0001$$$::...I can't escape from the dojo now.[lr]::
63160::$$$message_0581_0011_0002$$$::I give up and go over to Tohsaka.[lr]::
63161::$$$message_0581_0011_0003$$$::...I have a feeling Sakura's eyes are boring into me.::
63162::$$$message_0581_0012_0000$$$::"One warning before I start. You've talked about flipping a switch in your body before, but don't do that this time.[lr]::
63163::$$$message_0581_0012_0001$$$::You'll be in danger if you open and close your Magic Circuits carelessly."::
63164::$$$message_0581_0013_0000$$$::"O-okay. Got it."[lr]::
63165::$$$message_0581_0013_0001$$$::My voice pitches higher, and it's getting hard to breathe.[lr]::
63166::$$$message_0581_0013_0002$$$::I'm half naked, and really close to Tohsaka.[lr]::
63167::$$$message_0581_0013_0003$$$::Why wouldn't I be nervous?::
63168::$$$message_0581_0014_0000$$$::"Hey, are you listening to me? I need you to relax."[lr]::
63169::$$$message_0581_0014_0001$$$::"...I'm listening. I am."::
63170::$$$message_0581_0015_0000$$$::"...? Fine, then.[lr]::
63171::$$$message_0581_0015_0001$$$::I'm about to do surgery to suppress your magical energy.[lr]::
63172::$$$message_0581_0015_0002$$$::Right now, you're unstable, and Archer's power could backflow into you from his arm at any time. I'm going to insert needles into your left shoulder, throat, and belly button, preventing you from connecting to your left arm unless you try really hard to."::
63173::$$$message_0581_0016_0000$$$::"It's a precaution against the Shadow, too.[lr]::
63174::$$$message_0581_0016_0001$$$::That thing sucks up any magical energy near it. This Sign I engrave in you will give you some magic resistance, so you should feel less uncomfortable the next time you run into it."[lr]::
63175::$$$message_0581_0016_0002$$$::With that, Tohsaka places her palm on my chest.::
63176::$$$message_0581_0017_0000$$$::"Hyaaah!"[lr]::
63177::$$$message_0581_0017_0001$$$::I yelp in surprise and barely manage to stop my feet from beating a hasty retreat.::
63178::$$$message_0581_0018_0000$$$::"Oh, is it hot? Can you put up with it? I'm going to transfer a crest to you through my left hand, so I can't lower the temperature any more than this."[lr]::
63179::$$$message_0581_0018_0001$$$::"No...the temperature's fine."::
63180::$$$message_0581_0019_0000$$$::Tohsaka's hand was so soft, it nearly shattered my heart.[lr]::
63181::$$$message_0581_0019_0001$$$::Each time her girlish, slender fingers touch my chest, I can feel the heat rising in my head.::
63182::$$$message_0581_0020_0000$$$::"...Okay. I have a good idea of your chest now. Next I'll do your navel, and it's going to hurt a little. I need to stick my finger in your belly button, so try not to move. Don't worry, I won't move it around too much so it won't injure you."::
63183::$$$message_0581_0021_0000$$$::"Wait. Move what around, Tohsa...ka...!"[lr]::
63184::$$$message_0581_0021_0001$$$::My body spasms.::
63185::$$$message_0581_0022_0000$$$::   My stomach.[lr]::
63186::$$$message_0581_0022_0001$$$::Tohsaka's palm on my chest was unbearable enough, but now something small and stick-like is under my skin, digging around inside my body...!::
63187::$$$message_0581_0023_0000$$$::"Hah... W-wait, not...yet..."[lr]::
63188::$$$message_0581_0023_0001$$$::"I-I said it would hurt! Stop making those noises, it's distracting! It makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong!"::
63189::$$$message_0581_0024_0000$$$::"Y-you idiot...!"[lr]::
63190::$$$message_0581_0024_0001$$$::It's only making me blush even worse when you talk about it that way!::
63191::$$$message_0581_0025_0000$$$::"...Hmm. That's it for your navel. Now I'll move to your shoulder and throat. Stay still, okay?"::
63192::$$$message_0581_0026_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
63193::$$$message_0581_0026_0001$$$::I'd rather dash out of the room like a scared rabbit.[lr]::
63194::$$$message_0581_0026_0002$$$::I want to run, but it'll just make Tohsaka more self-conscious, so I stop protesting.::
63195::$$$message_0581_0027_0000$$$::"Come on, suck it up. I'll start with your shoulder. Hang in there. Grit your teeth and stop making funny noises!"[lr]::
63196::$$$message_0581_0027_0001$$$::"O-okay. I'll try."[lr]::
63197::$$$message_0581_0027_0002$$$::I look away from Tohsaka, feeling embarrassed.::
63198::$$$message_0581_0028_0000$$$::My whole body must be red, not just my face.[lr]::
63199::$$$message_0581_0028_0001$$$::I know we're doing it for the magecraft, so I feel bad for making Tohsaka uncomfortable, too.[lr]::
63200::$$$message_0581_0028_0002$$$::(Sigh)[lr]::
63201::$$$message_0581_0028_0003$$$::How am I supposed to look her in the eye after this?::
63202::$$$message_0581_0029_0000$$$::"There, I'm finished. Go cool off. I need to put away my tools."[lr]::
63203::$$$message_0581_0029_0001$$$::Tohsaka starts packing her first aid kit-looking box into her overnight bag.::
63204::$$$message_0581_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
63205::$$$message_0581_0030_0001$$$::Still flushed, I finally manage to catch my breath.[lr]::
63206::$$$message_0581_0030_0002$$$::And then...::
63207::$$$message_0581_0031_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
63208::$$$message_0581_0031_0001$$$::I notice that Sakura looks like she wants to say something. She's looking away and wringing her hands uncomfortably.::
63209::$$$message_0581_0032_0000$$$::"...Sakura? What's wrong?"[lr]::
63210::$$$message_0581_0032_0001$$$::"Um..."[lr]::
63211::$$$message_0581_0032_0002$$$::She glances at my face.[lr]::
63212::$$$message_0581_0032_0003$$$::Then, she takes a deep breath as if to work up her courage, and asks,::
63213::$$$message_0581_0033_0000$$$::"Um, Senpai...! W-we're a couple, right!?"::
63214::$$$message_0581_0034_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
63215::$$$message_0581_0034_0001$$$::My cheeks suddenly reach boiling temperature again, just seconds after cooling off.::
63216::$$$message_0581_0035_0000$$$::"Agh... Oof."::
63217::$$$message_0581_0036_0000$$$::"Senpai...?"[lr]::
63218::$$$message_0581_0036_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
63219::$$$message_0581_0036_0002$$$::Stop it.[lr]::
63220::$$$message_0581_0036_0003$$$::This is absolutely the wrong time to get tongue-tied.::
63221::$$$message_0581_0037_0000$$$::"...Yeah, you're my[line2]"[lr]::
63222::$$$message_0581_0037_0001$$$::"Th-that's right! I'm just being weird for letting my sister get to my head!"::
63223::$$$message_0581_0038_0000$$$::Finally, I realize that Sakura's been looking so hurt because she's been pouting.::
63224::$$$message_0581_0039_0000$$$::"Sorry. But Sakura, Tohsaka and I aren't like that. I just... couldn't help myself in that situation."[lr]::
63225::$$$message_0581_0039_0001$$$::"I-I know that, but please try to keep it together! You're my b-boyfriend!"::
63226::$$$message_0581_0040_0000$$$::"I know..."[lr]::
63227::$$$message_0581_0040_0001$$$::I couldn't resist.[lr]::
63228::$$$message_0581_0040_0002$$$::I'm a guy, and I've had a crush on Tohsaka since my first year of high school, so there was nothing I could do.::
63229::$$$message_0581_0041_0000$$$::"...Sorry. I'll keep it together next time. I'll do my best not to let her get the better of me."[lr]::
63230::$$$message_0581_0041_0001$$$::"...Really? I'll get mad if it happens again."::
63231::$$$message_0581_0042_0000$$$::I tell her I really will try, feeling apologetic from the bottom of my heart.::
63232::$$$message_0581_0043_0000$$$::(Sigh)[lr]::
63233::$$$message_0581_0043_0001$$$::I can't believe I'm only now realizing it, but,[lr]::
63234::$$$message_0581_0043_0002$$$::well, it's awfully nerve-wracking living under the same roof with three girls.::
