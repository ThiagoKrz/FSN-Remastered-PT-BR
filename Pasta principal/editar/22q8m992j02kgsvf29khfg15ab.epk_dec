55456::$$$message_0492_0000_0001$$$::I know what's right.[lr]::
55457::$$$message_0492_0000_0002$$$::What keeps me alive.[lr]::
55458::$$$message_0492_0000_0003$$$::I can't turn my back on the thing that kept me alive.::
55459::$$$message_0492_0001_0000$$$::"Sorry, Illya. I can't protect something so obvious."[lr]::
55460::$$$message_0492_0001_0001$$$::I still my mind and turn it to steel.[lr]::
55461::$$$message_0492_0001_0002$$$::It's over.[lr]::
55462::$$$message_0492_0001_0003$$$::They all stop[line2]the gastric juices rising to my throat, the pain racking my bowels, and the tears threatening to erupt from my eyes.::
55463::$$$message_0492_0002_0000$$$::I won't compromise my principles.[lr]::
55464::$$$message_0492_0002_0001$$$::For the sake of those who couldn't be saved, I won't let any more people share the same fate.::
55465::$$$message_0492_0003_0000$$$::"...Oh. In the end, you're choosing the same way as Kiritsugu. You'll abandon the people who are most important to you for someone you don't even know."::
55466::$$$message_0492_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55467::$$$message_0492_0004_0001$$$::He was a man who cast aside his most important people for what he believed in.[lr]::
55468::$$$message_0492_0004_0002$$$::I've chosen the same path.[lr]::
55469::$$$message_0492_0004_0003$$$::This marks the second time I've betrayed Illya.[lr]::
55470::$$$message_0492_0004_0004$$$::By choosing not to side with Sakura, I've also chosen not to side with Illya.::
55471::$$$message_0492_0005_0000$$$::"Yeah. I'm the same as Kiritsugu. If you're going to hate someone, hate me."[lr]::
55472::$$$message_0492_0005_0001$$$::My heart is turning to hard iron.[lr]::
55473::$$$message_0492_0005_0002$$$::Neither scorn nor hatred weigh on me now.::
55474::$$$message_0492_0006_0000$$$::The silver-haired girl doesn't say anything.[lr]::
55475::$$$message_0492_0006_0001$$$::Now is her chance to take the revenge she couldn't against Kiritsugu.[lr]::
55476::$$$message_0492_0006_0002$$$::And yet...::
55477::$$$message_0492_0007_0000$$$::"I feel sorry for you, Shirou.[lr]::
55478::$$$message_0492_0007_0001$$$::You're going to keep deceiving yourself forever, all while looking like you're about to cry."[lr]::
55479::$$$message_0492_0007_0002$$$::With a dwindling smile, Illya bids me farewell.::
55480::$$$message_0492_0008_0000$$$::It begins to rain.[lr]::
55481::$$$message_0492_0008_0001$$$::There's no one left in the park.[lr]::
55482::$$$message_0492_0008_0002$$$::Things should be finished at the church by now.::
55483::$$$message_0492_0009_0000$$$::   I open the door.[lr]::
55484::$$$message_0492_0009_0001$$$::Tohsaka's standing in a corner of the chapel. It looks like she's been here for a while.[lr]::
55485::$$$message_0492_0009_0002$$$::From the way she stands, I can feel a certain determination.[lr]::
55486::$$$message_0492_0009_0003$$$::It's the face of a ruthless mage who has decided to treat Sakura as an enemy if the Crest Worms can't be removed.::
55487::$$$message_0492_0010_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
55488::$$$message_0492_0010_0001$$$::Tohsaka doesn't look at me, and I have nothing to say to her.[lr]::
55489::$$$message_0492_0010_0002$$$::   For a long time, the chapel is filled only with the drumming of the rain.[lr]::
55490::$$$message_0492_0010_0003$$$::I'm not sure how long it goes on for.::
55491::$$$message_0492_0011_0000$$$::"The surgery is finished. There is nothing more I can do."[lr]::
55492::$$$message_0492_0011_0001$$$::Kirei Kotomine appears, breaking the silence.::
55493::$$$message_0492_0012_0000$$$::"...Kirei. How's Sakura?"[lr]::
55494::$$$message_0492_0012_0001$$$::"I've done all that I can. I have nothing more to say."[lr]::
55495::$$$message_0492_0012_0002$$$::The outcome is as expected.[lr]::
55496::$$$message_0492_0012_0003$$$::There was never any way to save Sakura.::
55497::$$$message_0492_0013_0000$$$::"Sakura Matou is sleeping. She will likely wake up tomorrow morning.[lr]::
55498::$$$message_0492_0013_0001$$$::What will you do as the Tohsaka heir, Rin?"[lr]::
55499::$$$message_0492_0013_0002$$$::"That goes without saying. It's the administrator's job to drive out a mage that's fallen from the path. Doubly so when it's my own family."::
55500::$$$message_0492_0014_0000$$$::Tohsaka starts walking toward the back of the chapel,[lr]::
55501::$$$message_0492_0014_0001$$$::where Sakura is sleeping in a back room.::
55502::$$$message_0492_0015_0000$$$::"You're not going to stop me, Emiya?"[lr]::
55503::$$$message_0492_0015_0001$$$::Tohsaka turns to face me as she reaches for the door.[lr]::
55504::$$$message_0492_0015_0002$$$::I answer her with silence.::
55505::$$$message_0492_0016_0000$$$::"Then you're fine with this, even if I kill Sakura?"[lr]::
55506::$$$message_0492_0016_0001$$$::"I don't have an opinion. But...if we can switch places, then I will."[lr]::
55507::$$$message_0492_0016_0002$$$::"No. This is my duty. I can't yield it to you."::
55508::$$$message_0492_0017_0000$$$::Tohsaka opens the door and disappears into the back.[lr]::
55509::$$$message_0492_0017_0001$$$::"I'm surprised. I thought you would stop her."[lr]::
55510::$$$message_0492_0017_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55511::$$$message_0492_0017_0003$$$::"...Hm. So you've made up your mind.[lr]::
55512::$$$message_0492_0017_0004$$$::Now the Holy Grail War will return to normal. It is somewhat anti-climactic, but an enjoyable conclusion all its own."::
55513::$$$message_0492_0018_0000$$$::"...Enjoyable? What's so fun about it? Do you like betting on who will win or lose?"[lr]::
55514::$$$message_0492_0018_0001$$$::"Predictions? There's no need for such a farce.[lr]::
55515::$$$message_0492_0018_0002$$$::...You will win.[lr]::
55516::$$$message_0492_0018_0003$$$::Now that you have cast off Sakura Matou, you will use any means necessary to kill Zouken Matou, kill Illyasviel, and kill Rin. That is the outcome I am looking forward to."::
55517::$$$message_0492_0019_0000$$$::"...Why? I'm not going to fight Tohsaka. I don't have any reason to stop her from getting the Holy Grail."::
55518::$$$message_0492_0020_0000$$$::"No, you will fight. Once you learn of the Grail's true nature, you will be forced to fight Rin. Now that Rin has been forced to kill Sakura, she will have a breakdown unless she obtains the Holy Grail.[lr]::
55519::$$$message_0492_0020_0001$$$::She will try to win for her own convictions, while you will destroy the Grail for your own ideals.[lr]::
55520::$$$message_0492_0020_0002$$$::Each of you can no longer abide the other. And so, the final act of this Holy Grail War will fall on your shoulders."::
55521::$$$message_0492_0021_0000$$$::The priest moves to leave the chapel.[lr]::
55522::$$$message_0492_0021_0001$$$::He must have guessed that the deed is done,[lr]::
55523::$$$message_0492_0021_0002$$$::in the room where Tohsaka is with Sakura.::
55524::$$$message_0492_0022_0000$$$::"So you think I'll be the last man standing."[lr]::
55525::$$$message_0492_0022_0001$$$::"Of course. You are now Kiritsugu Emiya. There is no way you would lose."[lr]::
55526::$$$message_0492_0022_0002$$$::...The priest departs, leaving only Shirou Emiya in the chapel,[lr]::
55527::$$$message_0492_0022_0003$$$::with a mind made of steel.::
55528::$$$message_0492_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55529::$$$message_0492_0023_0001$$$::The priest's prediction is true.[lr]::
55530::$$$message_0492_0023_0002$$$::I'll keep fighting, defeat Zouken and Illya, drive Tohsaka away, and destroy the Holy Grail.[lr]::
55531::$$$message_0492_0023_0003$$$::Then, this war will end.[lr]::
55532::$$$message_0492_0023_0004$$$::I've sworn to do the right thing.[lr]::
55533::$$$message_0492_0023_0005$$$::This is the first price I must pay to stay true to my ideals.::
55534::$$$message_0492_0024_0000$$$::The conclusion to my path is obvious, and needs no further explanation.[lr]::
55535::$$$message_0492_0024_0001$$$::Shirou Emiya will forge his mind into a steel sword,[lr]::
55536::$$$message_0492_0024_0002$$$::and become a champion of justice.ù‹èg
