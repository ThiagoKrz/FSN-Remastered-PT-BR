58759::$$$message_0527_0000_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
58760::$$$message_0527_0000_0002$$$::Her gaze is painfully unrelenting.[lr]::
58761::$$$message_0527_0000_0003$$$::While my knife rhythmically chops tofu, Saber is sitting in a dignified seiza posture,[lr]::
58762::$$$message_0527_0000_0004$$$::staring intently at my face.::
58763::$$$message_0527_0001_0000$$$::"I'm going to go to school like I usually do."[lr]::
58764::$$$message_0527_0001_0001$$$::We haven't seen eye to eye since I suggested doing so.[lr]::
58765::$$$message_0527_0001_0002$$$::Saber is against it, of course.[lr]::
58766::$$$message_0527_0001_0003$$$::She says it's too dangerous to let her Master go out alone.[lr]::
58767::$$$message_0527_0001_0004$$$::But I have my own life to worry about.::
58768::$$$message_0527_0002_0000$$$::Fuji-nee will get suspicious if I miss class, and I'll never know what's happening outside if I stay cooped up at home.[lr]::
58769::$$$message_0527_0002_0001$$$::Besides, we might tip off the other Masters if Saber goes outside.[lr]::
58770::$$$message_0527_0002_0002$$$::I think it's worth going out on my own to scout out the terrain.::
58771::$$$message_0527_0003_0000$$$::"Masters aren't supposed to fight in public view, right? So it should be safe during the day. As long as I stay in places with a lot of people, they won't attack me."[lr]::
58772::$$$message_0527_0003_0001$$$::Saber disagreed, saying that it wasn't a guarantee of safety.[lr]::
58773::$$$message_0527_0003_0002$$$::...To be honest, I lost my temper at how overprotective she was being, and stubbornly insisted on going to school, so that's where we are now.::
58774::$$$message_0527_0004_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
58775::$$$message_0527_0004_0001$$$::Saber's gaze is painful because she's angry at me.::
58776::$$$message_0527_0005_0000$$$::Lesson of the day: [lr]::
58777::$$$message_0527_0005_0001$$$::She knows how to hold a grudge. And she's pretty emotional about it too, so she can be a handful.[lr]::
58778::$$$message_0527_0005_0002$$$::I'd better be careful not to get into any shouting matches with her in the future.::
58779::$$$message_0527_0006_0000$$$::"...So hard-headed."[lr]::
58780::$$$message_0527_0006_0001$$$::"What did you just say, Shirou?"[lr]::
58781::$$$message_0527_0006_0002$$$::"Oh, I was just talking to myself. I said, this tofu's really hard."[lr]::
58782::$$$message_0527_0006_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58783::$$$message_0527_0006_0004$$$::And her hearing's too damn sharp! Definitely not the sort of person you'd want to have a cold war with.::
58784::$$$message_0527_0007_0000$$$::"Hm? Oh, it's that time arleady."[lr]::
58785::$$$message_0527_0007_0001$$$::The doorbell rings, and I hear the front door open.[lr]::
58786::$$$message_0527_0007_0002$$$::Sakura announces herself a second later.::
58787::$$$message_0527_0008_0000$$$::"Oh, I lost thirty minutes arguing with Saber."::
58788::$$$message_0527_0009_0000$$$::Still, I'm mostly finished making breakfast.[lr]::
58789::$$$message_0527_0009_0001$$$::I thought about making sandwiches to make Saber happy, but she didn't look like she was in the mood, so I won't.[lr]::
58790::$$$message_0527_0009_0002$$$::Japanese people eat rice.[lr]::
58791::$$$message_0527_0009_0003$$$::I resist the violence of her gaze by making her follow the old adage, 'when in Rome.'::
58792::$$$message_0527_0010_0000$$$::"Good morning, Senpai. Are you already finished making breakfast?"[lr]::
58793::$$$message_0527_0010_0001$$$::"Yeah, I just finished cleaning up. Morning, Sakura. Fuji-nee should be here soon, so help me set the table."::
58794::$$$message_0527_0011_0000$$$::"Okay. I'll help."[lr]::
58795::$$$message_0527_0011_0001$$$::Sakura sets her bag down in the living room and greets Saber.::
58796::$$$message_0527_0012_0000$$$::"Good morning, Saber. Did you sleep well last night?"[lr]::
58797::$$$message_0527_0012_0001$$$::"Yes. The room is quite new to me, but I've gotten accustomed to the house."[lr]::
58798::$$$message_0527_0012_0002$$$::...Oh, they're talking.[lr]::
58799::$$$message_0527_0012_0003$$$::They didn't yesterday, but Sakura seems to have accepted her.::
58800::$$$message_0527_0013_0000$$$::"Thank you for waiting, Senpai. How do you want me to set the table?"[lr]::
58801::$$$message_0527_0013_0001$$$::"Mm, one big plate and four small plates for the four of us. The salad's ready, so go ahead and dress it however you want."[lr]::
58802::$$$message_0527_0013_0002$$$::"All right. Wow, are we having German potato salad today?[lr]::
58803::$$$message_0527_0013_0003$$$::You're really going all-out with the Western breakfast."::
58804::$$$message_0527_0014_0000$$$::As she expresses her surprise, Sakura scoops the large serving of potato salad onto the big plate and garnishes it.[lr]::
58805::$$$message_0527_0014_0001$$$::I'd like to object that the only Western thing about this meal is the salad, though.[lr]::
58806::$$$message_0527_0014_0002$$$::...I'd like to further point out that this isn't a concession to Saber. I just felt like making potato salad.::
58807::$$$message_0527_0015_0000$$$::"Oh, that smells nice. May I have a taste?"[lr]::
58808::$$$message_0527_0015_0001$$$::"Sure, but it's hot. And maybe a little sweet."[lr]::
58809::$$$message_0527_0015_0002$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
58810::$$$message_0527_0015_0003$$$::Sakura uses a pair of long frying chopsticks to sample the potatoes I'm cooking.::
58811::$$$message_0527_0016_0000$$$::"Mmm... Oh, that really is sweet. That doesn't come from the onions, does it?"[lr]::
58812::$$$message_0527_0016_0001$$$::She licks her lips as she considers the recipe.::
58813::$$$message_0527_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58814::$$$message_0527_0017_0001$$$::Watching her, I'm...surprised.[lr]::
58815::$$$message_0527_0017_0002$$$::I've seen Sakura taste test food plenty of times, but from this close, was she always so charming?::
58816::$$$message_0527_0018_0000$$$::"Yeah, it's good, Senpai! I like how you seasoned it!"[lr]::
58817::$$$message_0527_0018_0001$$$::She must be fond of it, because she enthusiastically scoops potatoes into the big plate.[lr]::
58818::$$$message_0527_0018_0002$$$::That's the usual Sakura.[lr]::
58819::$$$message_0527_0018_0003$$$::I'm relieved to feel my surprise draining away.::
58820::$$$message_0527_0019_0000$$$::"Sakura."[lr]::
58821::$$$message_0527_0019_0001$$$::"Yes? What is it?"[lr]::
58822::$$$message_0527_0019_0002$$$::She's the same old Sakura.[lr]::
58823::$$$message_0527_0019_0003$$$::She's no different than she was yesterday.::
58824::$$$message_0527_0020_0000$$$::"Shinji[line2]"[lr]::
58825::$$$message_0527_0020_0001$$$::I stop just short of asking her what happened after he went home last night.[lr]::
58826::$$$message_0527_0020_0002$$$::If Shinji has a grudge against me for yesterday, then I doubt he would've let Sakura come over.::
58827::$$$message_0527_0021_0000$$$::Shinji may be a Master belonging to a family of mages, but that has nothing to do with Sakura.[lr]::
58828::$$$message_0527_0021_0001$$$::She won't be pulled into this war.::
58829::$$$message_0527_0022_0000$$$::Still, I worry for her.[lr]::
58830::$$$message_0527_0022_0001$$$::If something happens that causes Shinji to dump on Sakura all the Matou family affairs, the Holy Grail War, and the fight between Masters, then she'll definitely be involved.[lr]::
58831::$$$message_0527_0022_0002$$$::I have to prevent that, no matter what.::
58832::$$$message_0527_0023_0000$$$::"Uh, never mind."::
58833::$$$message_0527_0024_0000$$$::"Okay.[lr]::
58834::$$$message_0527_0024_0001$$$::...By the way, please don't talk to my brother today.[lr]::
58835::$$$message_0527_0024_0002$$$::He was acting off last night. I think he's in a bad mood, so he might say something weird to you."::
58836::$$$message_0527_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58837::$$$message_0527_0025_0001$$$::I need to make sure Sakura doesn't know what happened.::
58838::$$$message_0527_0026_0000$$$::...I know why Shinji's acting that way, of course.[lr]::
58839::$$$message_0527_0026_0001$$$::He went off the rails last night.[lr]::
58840::$$$message_0527_0026_0002$$$::He lost his status as a Master, and his grandfather berated him.[lr]::
58841::$$$message_0527_0026_0003$$$::Considering Shinji's personality, he must be seriously pissed at me.::
58842::$$$message_0527_0027_0000$$$::"Kuh..."[lr]::
58843::$$$message_0527_0027_0001$$$::Sakura doesn't know anything.[lr]::
58844::$$$message_0527_0027_0002$$$::She's ignorant of her brother's situation and her family's secrets.[lr]::
58845::$$$message_0527_0027_0003$$$::Then...is it safe for her to keep living with Shinji?[lr]::
58846::$$$message_0527_0027_0004$$$::Shinji hasn't given up.[lr]::
58847::$$$message_0527_0027_0005$$$::I can't rule out the chance that he might do something awful to his sister.::
58848::$$$message_0527_0028_0000$$$::"...Um, Senpai? I'm sorry for causing you trouble so early in the morning."[lr]::
58849::$$$message_0527_0028_0001$$$::"Silly, don't say that. You aren't any trouble."::
58850::$$$message_0527_0029_0000$$$::...I'm the one causing trouble for you.[lr]::
58851::$$$message_0527_0029_0001$$$::I should have forseen this situation after fighting Shinji.[lr]::
58852::$$$message_0527_0029_0002$$$::I need to think... To come up with a way that Sakura can keep living her life.[lr]::
58853::$$$message_0527_0029_0003$$$::To find a way to let her keep smiling like she always has.::
58854::$$$message_0527_0030_0000$$$::Breakfast ends in a gloomy mood.[lr]::
58855::$$$message_0527_0030_0001$$$::I don't know why, but Fuji-nee never showed up, and Sakura ate in silence the whole time.[lr]::
58856::$$$message_0527_0030_0002$$$::Saber's always been stoic, and I'm not exactly talkative, either.[lr]::
58857::$$$message_0527_0030_0003$$$::We clean up quickly after breakfast, and Sakura leaves forty minutes early for morning practice.::
58858::$$$message_0527_0031_0000$$$::"...Um, I'll be going now, Senpai."[lr]::
58859::$$$message_0527_0031_0001$$$::Sakura forces a smile and puts on her shoes.::
58860::$$$message_0527_0032_0000$$$::"Yeah. Don't be too hard on yourself at club. I know you've been pushing yourself because you haven't been feeling well. Just go through the motions and have tea in the back. If Mitsuzuri has a problem with it, just tell her it's a favor to me."::
58861::$$$message_0527_0033_0000$$$::"Okay. The captain will be happy to hear that."[lr]::
58862::$$$message_0527_0033_0001$$$::The front door slides open with a clatter.[lr]::
58863::$$$message_0527_0033_0002$$$::Sakura bows, turns to leave,[lr]::
58864::$$$message_0527_0033_0003$$$::and runs smack into the door.::
58865::$$$message_0527_0034_0000$$$::"S-Sakura!?"[lr]::
58866::$$$message_0527_0034_0001$$$::"Owww..."[lr]::
58867::$$$message_0527_0034_0002$$$::She holds her nose, moaning.::
58868::$$$message_0527_0035_0000$$$::"H-hey, are you okay!? Is your nose bleeding!?"[lr]::
58869::$$$message_0527_0035_0001$$$::"Y-yeah, I'm ogay. I'd die of embarrassbent if you saw me get a nosebleed."[lr]::
58870::$$$message_0527_0035_0002$$$::Sakura stands up unsteadily.[lr]::
58871::$$$message_0527_0035_0003$$$::Surely, that accident happened because she wasn't paying attention...right?::
58872::$$$message_0527_0036_0000$$$::"Are you sure you're feeling all right? You looked more like you fainted, rather than just running into the door.  If you're feeling dizzy today, then[line2]"[lr]::
58873::$$$message_0527_0036_0001$$$::"Huh? That's not what happened. I just wasn't paying attention. I'm so embarrassed."[lr]::
58874::$$$message_0527_0036_0002$$$::"..."::
58875::$$$message_0527_0037_0000$$$::"I'll be going on ahead, Senpai. I'll let Ms. Fujimura know that breakfast was delicious today."[lr]::
58876::$$$message_0527_0037_0001$$$::Sakura leaves without further incident, trying to downplay my worries.::
58877::$$$message_0527_0038_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58878::$$$message_0527_0038_0001$$$::She does look full of energy.[lr]::
58879::$$$message_0527_0038_0002$$$::If she's tired, maybe it's mental rather than physical fatigue.::
58880::$$$message_0527_0039_0000$$$::"...There's still Shinji to deal with. I can't let things stay like this..."[lr]::
58881::$$$message_0527_0039_0001$$$::I say that, but I don't have any clear solutions.[lr]::
58882::$$$message_0527_0039_0002$$$::I can't consult Saber about this, nor can I tell Sakura the truth. Fuji-nee's completely out, of course.::
58883::$$$message_0527_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58884::$$$message_0527_0040_0001$$$::Damn it. If only there was someone who goes to the same school as me I could ask for advice, who would actually know what the Holy Grail War is...[lr]::
58885::$$$message_0527_0040_0002$$$::"Haah. As if someone that convenient would just walk up to me at school..."::
