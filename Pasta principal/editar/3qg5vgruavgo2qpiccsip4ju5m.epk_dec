53742::$$$message_0467_0000_0000$$$::"It's good to train, but you should do it in moderation. Jamming a finger is painful enough, but people aren't supposed to nearly break bones during practice."[lr]::
53743::$$$message_0467_0000_0001$$$::"Ow...! S-Sakura, can't you wrap the bandage a little slower?"::
53744::$$$message_0467_0001_0000$$$::"Of course it hurts, but if I don't do that, it's going to swell! Consider this your just deserts for being so careless."::
53745::$$$message_0467_0002_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
53746::$$$message_0467_0002_0001$$$::Sakura tapes my middle finger tightly.[lr]::
53747::$$$message_0467_0002_0002$$$::She does it skillfully. She probably sees a lot of sprained fingers in the kyudo club.[lr]::
53748::$$$message_0467_0002_0003$$$::Still, she could be gentler about it.::
53749::$$$message_0467_0003_0000$$$::"That goes for you too, Saber.[lr]::
53750::$$$message_0467_0003_0001$$$::If you're more skilled than Senpai is, shouldn't you be more careful with him? He's bruised all over, so he can't even take a bath."::
53751::$$$message_0467_0004_0000$$$::"Sakura, I should note that Shirou requested this.[lr]::
53752::$$$message_0467_0004_0001$$$::All I did was give him the intensity he asked for.[lr]::
53753::$$$message_0467_0004_0002$$$::And Shirou, you bear some responsibility for this as well. You should not have asked me to spar with you if you were going to be so unfocused."::
53754::$$$message_0467_0005_0000$$$::Saber looks at me, displeased.[lr]::
53755::$$$message_0467_0005_0001$$$::"Oof."[lr]::
53756::$$$message_0467_0005_0002$$$::I don't have any excuse for that.::
53757::$$$message_0467_0006_0000$$$::"Huh...? Senpai, are you not feeling well?[lr]::
53758::$$$message_0467_0006_0001$$$::...Um, it's not very like you to enter a dojo when you're distracted."::
53759::$$$message_0467_0007_0000$$$::"Exactly. What was going through your head? Even with sword in hand, you kept staring off into the distance. I didn't feel any drive from you at all."::
53760::$$$message_0467_0008_0000$$$::"Um, I..."[lr]::
53761::$$$message_0467_0008_0001$$$::Sakura was on my mind, but I obviously can't say that. The memory alone is enough to speed up my heart...::
53762::$$$message_0467_0009_0000$$$::"Senpai?[lr]::
53763::$$$message_0467_0009_0001$$$::...Does it still hurt somewhere?"[lr]::
53764::$$$message_0467_0009_0002$$$::Worried, Sakura leans in slightly.::
53765::$$$message_0467_0010_0000$$$::"...! N-no, I'm fine now! I just have indigestion because I ate too much, so if you'd make me some tea, that would really help!"[lr]::
53766::$$$message_0467_0010_0001$$$::I splutter and back away from Sakura.::
53767::$$$message_0467_0011_0000$$$::"All right. I'll make tea, then."[lr]::
53768::$$$message_0467_0011_0001$$$::Sakura stands up to go to the kitchen counter.::
53769::$$$message_0467_0012_0000$$$::"(Sigh)"[lr]::
53770::$$$message_0467_0012_0001$$$::That almost gave me a heart attack.[lr]::
53771::$$$message_0467_0012_0002$$$::The sight of her sleeping in the living room is still burned into my memory, so having her come so close makes me really self-conscious.::
53772::$$$message_0467_0013_0000$$$::"Would you like some too, Saber?"[lr]::
53773::$$$message_0467_0013_0001$$$::"Yes. I'll have it warm, please."[lr]::
53774::$$$message_0467_0013_0002$$$::Sakura briskly makes us tea.[lr]::
53775::$$$message_0467_0013_0003$$$::...I should be used to seeing her from behind, but for some reason, it feels so fresh.::
53776::$$$message_0467_0014_0000$$$::"Argh..."[lr]::
53777::$$$message_0467_0014_0001$$$::Damn it, where is my mind going?[lr]::
53778::$$$message_0467_0014_0002$$$::Saber's right. I've been acting off for a while.[lr]::
53779::$$$message_0467_0014_0003$$$::Just seeing Sakura is enough to remind me of her sleeping form earlier and those soft lips.::
53780::$$$message_0467_0015_0000$$$::...Damn, I'm pathetic.[lr]::
53781::$$$message_0467_0015_0001$$$::She's precious family to me, and someone who looks up to me.[lr]::
53782::$$$message_0467_0015_0002$$$::Why am I seeing her this way now?::
53783::$$$message_0467_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
53784::$$$message_0467_0016_0001$$$::......Shit.[lr]::
53785::$$$message_0467_0016_0002$$$::I know damn well why.[lr]::
53786::$$$message_0467_0016_0003$$$::Sakura's pretty. I've noticed that for a long time.[lr]::
53787::$$$message_0467_0016_0004$$$::But, even knowing that, I've tried to interact with her and her alone as her senpai.::
53788::$$$message_0467_0017_0000$$$::I like Sakura.[lr]::
53789::$$$message_0467_0017_0001$$$::...Before I knew it, I started taking her presence for granted. It gave me comfort.::
53790::$$$message_0467_0018_0000$$$::Not in a romantic sense, mind you.[lr]::
53791::$$$message_0467_0018_0001$$$::I've never wanted to be physically intimate with her.[lr]::
53792::$$$message_0467_0018_0002$$$::I know she's a girl, but I wasn't conscious of her as a member of the opposite sex.::
53793::$$$message_0467_0019_0000$$$::Except...[lr]::
53794::$$$message_0467_0019_0001$$$::It isn't because I don't think she is...[lr]::
53795::$$$message_0467_0019_0002$$$::...but rather, I was just trying not to see her that way.::
53796::$$$message_0467_0020_0000$$$::"Senpai?"::
53797::$$$message_0467_0021_0000$$$::"Here's your tea."[lr]::
53798::$$$message_0467_0021_0001$$$::"O-oh, yeah. Thanks, Sakura."[lr]::
53799::$$$message_0467_0021_0002$$$::"You're welcome. Thank you for making dinner."::
53800::$$$message_0467_0022_0000$$$::Sakura smiles happily.[lr]::
53801::$$$message_0467_0022_0001$$$::...Mm. Just that is enough to cheer me up.[lr]::
53802::$$$message_0467_0022_0002$$$::It seems like she really enjoyed the pork meatballs with grilled vegetables that I made for dinner.::
53803::$$$message_0467_0023_0000$$$::Sakura sets down Saber's cup of tea, then returns to her seat at the table.[lr]::
53804::$$$message_0467_0023_0001$$$::Saber accepts the green tea, looking content to have tea after dinner.::
53805::$$$message_0467_0024_0000$$$::"Thank you... How is Taiga doing, by the way? I haven't seen her around lately."[lr]::
53806::$$$message_0467_0024_0001$$$::"Huh? Oh, Fuji-nee called earlier and said she won't be coming tonight. I didn't ask for details, but she said she was visiting the hospital."::
53807::$$$message_0467_0025_0000$$$::"I see. She's familiar with your habits, so I was hoping to talk to her about it more.[lr]::
53808::$$$message_0467_0025_0001$$$::...I suppose we'll have to postpone you training for now, then."::
53809::$$$message_0467_0026_0000$$$::"Mrgh. Are you saying I'm still a beginner after training for the last couple days?"::
53810::$$$message_0467_0027_0000$$$::"Of course. Our training to date has been only to gain an appreciation of what you are physically capable of.[lr]::
53811::$$$message_0467_0027_0001$$$::Next, I will think of ways to help you survive using your own abilities."[lr]::
53812::$$$message_0467_0027_0002$$$::"Oh. That sounds like it's gonna be...tough."::
53813::$$$message_0467_0028_0000$$$::"Yes, you may find the training severe. So far, we have only been warming up."::
53814::$$$message_0467_0029_0000$$$::"Damn..."[lr]::
53815::$$$message_0467_0029_0001$$$::R-really?[lr]::
53816::$$$message_0467_0029_0002$$$::I don't know whether or not to be grateful to Fuji-nee for not coming over tonight.::
53817::$$$message_0467_0030_0000$$$::"What are you sighing for? This is for your sake[line2]Sakura?"[lr]::
53818::$$$message_0467_0030_0001$$$::Saber looks at Sakura.::
53819::$$$message_0467_0031_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
53820::$$$message_0467_0031_0001$$$::I follow her gaze.[lr]::
53821::$$$message_0467_0031_0002$$$::Oh, no.[lr]::
53822::$$$message_0467_0031_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
53823::$$$message_0467_0031_0004$$$::Sakura's breathing is labored.::
53824::$$$message_0467_0032_0000$$$::"Sakura...!"[lr]::
53825::$$$message_0467_0032_0001$$$::I rush over and grab her by the shoulders.::
53826::$$$message_0467_0033_0000$$$::"Huh...S-Senpai? Is something wrong!?"[lr]::
53827::$$$message_0467_0033_0001$$$::"[font italic=true]You[font italic=false], stupid! You're pushing yourself without telling us again[line2]"::
53828::$$$message_0467_0034_0000$$$::...Actually, she isn't. [lr]::
53829::$$$message_0467_0034_0001$$$::Sakura's shoulders aren't warm, and she doesn't look tired. She just stares up at me, confused."::
53830::$$$message_0467_0035_0000$$$::"Huh? You just looked like you were feeling sick again."[lr]::
53831::$$$message_0467_0035_0001$$$::"Ah. No, I'm fine. I just fell asleep for a few seconds."[lr]::
53832::$$$message_0467_0035_0002$$$::She chuckles sheepishly.::
53833::$$$message_0467_0036_0000$$$::"...Don't scare me like that. I thought your cold came back."::
53834::$$$message_0467_0037_0000$$$::"Sorry. I've been feeling sleepy all day, so my eyes start to close as soon as I relax."[lr]::
53835::$$$message_0467_0037_0001$$$::"Yeah, I did see you napping earlier this evening. If you're tired, just go lie down. I'll clean up the rest."::
53836::$$$message_0467_0038_0000$$$::"Ah...o-okay. Then I'll take you up on that. Thank you."[lr]::
53837::$$$message_0467_0038_0001$$$::Sakura gives me a slight bow of thanks and leaves the living room.[lr]::
53838::$$$message_0467_0038_0002$$$::She looks steady on her feet, so maybe she really just didn't get enough sleep last night.::
