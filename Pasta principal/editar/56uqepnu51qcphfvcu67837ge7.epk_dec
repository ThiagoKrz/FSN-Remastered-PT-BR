35015::$$$message_0287_0000_0000$$$::   Tohsaka is dead serious.[lr]::
35016::$$$message_0287_0000_0001$$$::There's no place to run, even if I retreat back to the hallway. I'll jump down the stairs in front of me...!::
35017::$$$message_0287_0001_0000$$$::"Hah, guh...!"[lr]::
35018::$$$message_0287_0001_0001$$$::I kick off the floor with full force.[lr]::
35019::$$$message_0287_0001_0002$$$::There's about a meter and a half down. I can easily land from this kind of height...!::
35020::$$$message_0287_0002_0000$$$::   A running long jump from a height of a meter and a half, a meter wide.[lr]::
35021::$$$message_0287_0002_0001$$$::I was able to land the way that I had imagined, without twisting my ankle.::
35022::$$$message_0287_0003_0000$$$::"Haa..."[lr]::
35023::$$$message_0287_0003_0001$$$::I was able to get an advantage of one floor from Tohsaka.[lr]::
35024::$$$message_0287_0003_0002$$$::So now, I just have to go down to the first floor without stopping and get out of the building[line2]::
35025::$$$message_0287_0004_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
35026::$$$message_0287_0004_0001$$$::What...just...happened...?[lr]::
35027::$$$message_0287_0004_0002$$$::It came from above.[lr]::
35028::$$$message_0287_0004_0003$$$::It feels like a giant glob of jelly fell on top of me...::
35029::$$$message_0287_0004_0004$$$::   I can't move my legs.[lr]::
35030::$$$message_0287_0004_0005$$$::The jelly is anchoring my feet.[lr]::
35031::$$$message_0287_0004_0006$$$::As soon as I realize that, I try my best to pull out of this sensation of weight.::
35032::$$$message_0287_0005_0000$$$::Immediately, a wave of nausea overcomes me.[lr]::
35033::$$$message_0287_0005_0001$$$::...It's cold.[lr]::
35034::$$$message_0287_0005_0002$$$::I have goosebumps all over, my joints creak, my muscles are heavy, and it feels like my insides grind to a halt.::
35035::$$$message_0287_0006_0000$$$::"Crap... This...is..."[lr]::
35036::$$$message_0287_0006_0001$$$::My legs aren't still because of some gelatinous substance.[lr]::
35037::$$$message_0287_0006_0002$$$::It's like...I'm ill.::
35038::$$$message_0287_0007_0000$$$::Tohsaka's magecraft.[lr]::
35039::$$$message_0287_0007_0001$$$::I've been hit with a Gandr Shot, which infects the target with flu symptoms.[lr]::
35040::$$$message_0287_0007_0002$$$::The curse drags my body down into a sensation of illness, leaving me paralyzed.::
35041::$$$message_0287_0008_0000$$$::"...Just as I expected. I figured that you would go there if I prepared an easy escape route."::
35042::$$$message_0287_0009_0000$$$::...I hear Tohsaka's voice from afar, as if she's contacting me from the distant moon.::
35043::$$$message_0287_0010_0000$$$::"...Let me apologize first. What I'm going to do now is as bad as taking away your life."::
35044::$$$message_0287_0011_0000$$$::Her cold finger digs into the back of my neck.[lr]::
35045::$$$message_0287_0011_0001$$$::When I realize it's Tohsaka's finger and try to fling it away[line2]::
35046::$$$message_0287_0012_0000$$$::"...Goodbye.[lr]::
35047::$$$message_0287_0012_0001$$$::I don't think you knew, but I've had my eye on you for a long time now."::
35048::$$$message_0287_0013_0000$$$::As if it snapped...[lr]::
35049::$$$message_0287_0013_0001$$$::My consciousness shorts out.::
35050::$$$message_0287_0014_0000$$$::"...Huh...? It's morning already?"[lr]::
35051::$$$message_0287_0014_0001$$$::I rouse my hazy mind and fight the urge to go back to sleep.[lr]::
35052::$$$message_0287_0014_0002$$$::It's already past 6 AM. I should be preparing breakfast right now.::
35053::$$$message_0287_0015_0000$$$::"Good morning, Senpai. Breakfast is already prepared."[lr]::
35054::$$$message_0287_0015_0001$$$::"Oh, okay. Sorry, I made you do it by yourself again. I was so sleepy for some reason and couldn't wake up. I'll make dinner to make it up."::
35055::$$$message_0287_0016_0000$$$::"No, you can't do that. It's my turn to cook dinner tonight, so please let me."[lr]::
35056::$$$message_0287_0016_0001$$$::"Ugh. But I'd be relying on you too much if I made you cook breakfast and dinner. Please let me cook tonight. I want to make it up to you for sleeping in."::
35057::$$$message_0287_0017_0000$$$::"Hmm, let's see. Then, let's cook dinner together.[lr]::
35058::$$$message_0287_0017_0001$$$::I'll help too, so please come home early."[lr]::
35059::$$$message_0287_0017_0002$$$::"All right. I'll leave work early today."::
35060::$$$message_0287_0018_0000$$$::I apologize to Sakura and sit at the dining table.[lr]::
35061::$$$message_0287_0018_0001$$$::Breakfast is on the table, and Fuji-nee runs in at the last second, as always.::
35062::$$$message_0287_0019_0000$$$::"Good morning! Everyone is doing well this morning... Wait, huh...? What is this, Shirou?"[lr]::
35063::$$$message_0287_0019_0001$$$::"Huh? What do you mean? Did you forget something at your house?"::
35064::$$$message_0287_0020_0000$$$::"Huh? Huh? Huh? Wait, that's weird. I knew something was strange, but nothing's strange at all.[lr]::
35065::$$$message_0287_0020_0001$$$::...But something still bothers me... Shirou, aren't you forgetting something?"[lr]::
35066::$$$message_0287_0020_0002$$$::"What? Forgetting something? Like what?"::
35067::$$$message_0287_0021_0000$$$::"D-don't ask me. I can't figure it out so I'm asking you.[lr]::
35068::$$$message_0287_0021_0001$$$::Hey, don't you think something is off, Sakura? Like something is missing, or you're forgetting something."::
35069::$$$message_0287_0022_0000$$$::"No, I think it is your imagination, Ms. Fujimura.[lr]::
35070::$$$message_0287_0022_0001$$$::I can't think of anything or anyone that's missing...?"::
35071::$$$message_0287_0023_0000$$$::"Hmm... Oh well. If I can't remember, then it must not be that important."[lr]::
35072::$$$message_0287_0023_0001$$$::Fuji-nee seems satisfied since she sits down and starts eating.[lr]::
35073::$$$message_0287_0023_0002$$$::Without a doubt, this is a normal morning.::
35074::$$$message_0287_0024_0000$$$::Thirty minutes after Fuji-nee and Sakura leave...[lr]::
35075::$$$message_0287_0024_0001$$$::As usual, I make my way out at a leisurely pace.::
35076::$$$message_0287_0025_0000$$$::I go up the hill that leads to school.[lr]::
35077::$$$message_0287_0025_0001$$$::It's past 7:30 AM, and the school road is crowded with students in the same uniform.[lr]::
35078::$$$message_0287_0025_0002$$$::A familiar scene.[lr]::
35079::$$$message_0287_0025_0003$$$::I breathe in the morning air with nothing missing.::
35080::$$$message_0287_0026_0000$$$::...Then...[lr]::
35081::$$$message_0287_0026_0001$$$::I make eye contact with a female student passing by.[lr]::
35082::$$$message_0287_0026_0002$$$::She must've found it awkward that our eyes met, as she starts walking up the hill briskly.::
35083::$$$message_0287_0027_0000$$$::"What, Emiya? Were you glaring at Tohsaka just now?"[lr]::
35084::$$$message_0287_0027_0001$$$::"Huh...? Oh, morning, Issei.[lr]::
35085::$$$message_0287_0027_0002$$$::I wasn't glaring at her or anything. We just made eye contact."::
35086::$$$message_0287_0028_0000$$$::"Really? That's fine then, but make sure not to pick a fight with Tohsaka. It's her belief to respond to provocation twofold, so you'll be throwing away your last year of school."::
35087::$$$message_0287_0029_0000$$$::I don't know how serious he is, but Issei murmurs a Buddhist sutra.[lr]::
35088::$$$message_0287_0029_0001$$$::But, that's a needless worry.::
35089::$$$message_0287_0030_0000$$$::"Are you stupid? I wouldn't pick a fight when I don't even know her.[lr]::
35090::$$$message_0287_0030_0001$$$::...Well, she is really beautiful, but I didn't even realize...someone like that was at our school...?"[lr]::
35091::$$$message_0287_0030_0002$$$::"Yes, that is the correct way to deal with her. That thing is too much for us humans to handle. It is our way as humans to not get involved.[lr]::
35092::$$$message_0287_0030_0003$$$::Well, I was worried for a second, but that settles it!"::
35093::$$$message_0287_0031_0000$$$::Issei goes up the hill.[lr]::
35094::$$$message_0287_0031_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
35095::$$$message_0287_0031_0002$$$::I watch him go as I stand there.::
35096::$$$message_0287_0032_0000$$$::A morning scene with nothing missing.[lr]::
35097::$$$message_0287_0032_0001$$$::My left hand hurts slightly.::
35098::$$$message_0287_0033_0000$$$::"Settles what? What happened and what ended, Issei?"[lr]::
35099::$$$message_0287_0033_0001$$$::The first bell rings from the top of the hill.::
35100::$$$message_0287_0034_0000$$$::...It's already 8 AM.[lr]::
35101::$$$message_0287_0034_0001$$$::I feel like I'm locked out of something, like the school gate closing.[lr]::
35102::$$$message_0287_0034_0002$$$::"...I think I..."[lr]::
35103::$$$message_0287_0034_0003$$$::...I can't remember anything.[lr]::
35104::$$$message_0287_0034_0004$$$::This vague sensation of unease just creeps up my spine, and I can't think of where I need to go or where I need to return to...::
