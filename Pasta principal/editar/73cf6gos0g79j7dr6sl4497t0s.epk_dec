66957::$$$message_0621_0000_0000$$$::"Forget it. You're Sakura's enemy. I can't trust you to watch my back."[lr]::
66958::$$$message_0621_0000_0001$$$::"I see. I thought I would be of help. A pity."[lr]::
66959::$$$message_0621_0000_0002$$$::The priest stops following me.[lr]::
66960::$$$message_0621_0000_0003$$$::...I can't afford to stop here.[lr]::
66961::$$$message_0621_0000_0004$$$::I need to catch up to Sakura as soon as possible.::
66962::$$$message_0621_0001_0000$$$::It's dawn by the time the taxi arrives at the forest.[lr]::
66963::$$$message_0621_0001_0001$$$::If you think it's sketchy for a high schooler to be taking a taxi at 3:00 AM, imagine him asking you to drop him off in the woods outside of town.[lr]::
66964::$$$message_0621_0001_0002$$$::After hailing no less than twelve cabs, I finally find a driver willing to take me. The sun is starting to rise by the time I arrive at the forest entrance.::
66965::$$$message_0621_0002_0000$$$::...This is my second time in these woods.[lr]::
66966::$$$message_0621_0002_0001$$$::I rely on my memory to find the Einzbern castle.[lr]::
66967::$$$message_0621_0002_0002$$$::...I couldn't reach it the last time I was here.[lr]::
66968::$$$message_0621_0002_0003$$$::On the way to the castle, I ran into Illya fleeing the Shadow.::
66969::$$$message_0621_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66970::$$$message_0621_0003_0001$$$::...I check my left arm.[lr]::
66971::$$$message_0621_0003_0002$$$::It's completely different since the last time I was here.[lr]::
66972::$$$message_0621_0003_0003$$$::I was helpless as the Shadow nearly slaughtered me.[lr]::
66973::$$$message_0621_0003_0004$$$::That hasn't changed.[lr]::
66974::$$$message_0621_0003_0005$$$::I have no way to beat Sakura[line2]no, the Shadow, and it has Saber on its side, too.::
66975::$$$message_0621_0004_0000$$$::...If I run into them, I'm done.[lr]::
66976::$$$message_0621_0004_0001$$$::The only way to take Illya back is to ambush them.[lr]::
66977::$$$message_0621_0004_0002$$$::I need to retrieve Illya without Sakura noticing me.[lr]::
66978::$$$message_0621_0004_0003$$$::In that case...::
66979::$$$message_0621_0005_0000$$$::In that case, what should I do?[lr]::
66980::$$$message_0621_0005_0001$$$::How should I deal with Sakura now that she's changed?[lr]::
66981::$$$message_0621_0005_0002$$$::How can I turn her back into the Sakura I used to know?::
66982::$$$message_0621_0006_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
66983::$$$message_0621_0006_0001$$$::I don't have an answer.[lr]::
66984::$$$message_0621_0006_0002$$$::All I can do is follow after them as quickly as I can.::
66985::$$$message_0621_0007_0000$$$::I see a familiar place.[lr]::
66986::$$$message_0621_0007_0001$$$::It's been a little over two hours since I entered the woods.[lr]::
66987::$$$message_0621_0007_0002$$$::The sun is already well over the horizon, but the forest is still shrouded in fog.::
66988::$$$message_0621_0008_0000$$$::...Last time, this was as far as I went.[lr]::
66989::$$$message_0621_0008_0001$$$::If the visions Illya showed me are true, then I should be at the castle soon.[lr]::
66990::$$$message_0621_0008_0002$$$::Almost there.[lr]::
66991::$$$message_0621_0008_0003$$$::Just a little more until I enter enemy territory...::
66992::$$$message_0621_0009_0000$$$::I get through the forest.[lr]::
66993::$$$message_0621_0009_0001$$$::I'm in a circular clearing in the vast sea of trees.[lr]::
66994::$$$message_0621_0009_0002$$$::The castle I saw through Illya's "eyes" towers over the forest, just as I remember.::
66995::$$$message_0621_0010_0000$$$::There's no sign of anyone around.[lr]::
66996::$$$message_0621_0010_0001$$$::It's strange that there's no guards on the castle walls, to say nothing of the castle, but I can't turn back now just because this might be a trap.::
66997::$$$message_0621_0011_0000$$$::Going through the front gate... is out of the question.[lr]::
66998::$$$message_0621_0011_0001$$$::If I'm going to sneak in, then I should use a window on the second floor or higher.[lr]::
66999::$$$message_0621_0011_0002$$$::"...I'll head around back. If push comes to shove, I'll use the back door."[lr]::
67000::$$$message_0621_0011_0003$$$::There isn't anyone guarding the back of the building.[lr]::
67001::$$$message_0621_0011_0004$$$::I climb up a sturdy-looking tree, and break in from the second floor.::
67002::$$$message_0621_0012_0000$$$::"Whoa!"[lr]::
67003::$$$message_0621_0012_0001$$$::I break a window as I jump into the building.[lr]::
67004::$$$message_0621_0012_0002$$$::The castle is deathly silent, even after my violent entry.::
67005::$$$message_0621_0013_0000$$$::"...Are they not even paying attention? Maybe they don't see me as a threat. Or maybe..."::
67006::$$$message_0621_0014_0000$$$::Zouken and Sakura might have already left.[lr]::
67007::$$$message_0621_0014_0001$$$::...That would explain the lack of any security.[lr]::
67008::$$$message_0621_0014_0002$$$::It's already been a full day since Sakura took Illya away.[lr]::
67009::$$$message_0621_0014_0003$$$::I don't know why they came out here, but they had plenty of time to finish whatever they came to do.::
67010::$$$message_0621_0015_0000$$$::"...No, there's someone here. Plus..."[lr]::
67011::$$$message_0621_0015_0001$$$::The castle is filled with a bizarre aura.[lr]::
67012::$$$message_0621_0015_0002$$$::An overwhelming torrent of magical energy coils around my skin like fog.[lr]::
67013::$$$message_0621_0015_0003$$$::...There's no doubt.[lr]::
67014::$$$message_0621_0015_0004$$$::This magical energy belongs to the version of Sakura I saw at my house, with the strange markings taking over her body.::
67015::$$$message_0621_0016_0000$$$::"It's getting thicker the lower I go..."[lr]::
67016::$$$message_0621_0016_0001$$$::Sakura's on the first floor.[lr]::
67017::$$$message_0621_0016_0002$$$::...I could look for the stairs down, but I should find Illya first.[lr]::
67018::$$$message_0621_0016_0003$$$::I'm screwed if Sakura is with her, but she might be imprisoned somewhere in the castle. I need to get her out of here before our showdown with Sakura.::
67019::$$$message_0621_0017_0000$$$::None of the castle doors or gates are locked.[lr]::
67020::$$$message_0621_0017_0001$$$::I go from the second floor to the third, then the fourth.[lr]::
67021::$$$message_0621_0017_0002$$$::I search every nook and cranny for any sign of Illya.::
67022::$$$message_0621_0018_0000$$$::Now I'm deep within the fourth floor.[lr]::
67023::$$$message_0621_0018_0001$$$::I step into a room that looks like a warehouse. It's different than the rest.::
67024::$$$message_0621_0019_0000$$$::"Illya, are you there...?"[lr]::
67025::$$$message_0621_0019_0001$$$::I call out in a hushed voice.[lr]::
67026::$$$message_0621_0019_0002$$$::There are things scattered everywhere, making it hard to see. Maybe this is a storage room.::
67027::$$$message_0621_0020_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
67028::$$$message_0621_0020_0001$$$::If Illya isn't here, then I can only presume she's on the first floor with Sakura[line2]::
67029::$$$message_0621_0021_0000$$$::"Who's there!?"[lr]::
67030::$$$message_0621_0021_0001$$$::I whirl around at the sound of footsteps.[lr]::
67031::$$$message_0621_0021_0002$$$::Someone steps through the door.[lr]::
67032::$$$message_0621_0021_0003$$$::It's a familiar-looking woman in a white dress.::
67033::$$$message_0621_0022_0000$$$::"Oh, you're..."[lr]::
67034::$$$message_0621_0022_0001$$$::Illya's other caretaker, whom she called Sella.::
67035::$$$message_0621_0023_0000$$$::"Welcome home, Master Emiya. My mistress says that she will not be meeting you."[lr]::
67036::$$$message_0621_0023_0001$$$::"Uh... Wait, you mean Illya...!?"[lr]::
67037::$$$message_0621_0023_0002$$$::"...Please address her as Lady Illyasviel. You have no right to be so familiar with her."::
67038::$$$message_0621_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67039::$$$message_0621_0024_0001$$$::I'm taken aback by her icy tone.[lr]::
67040::$$$message_0621_0024_0002$$$::"That is all my mistress told me to relay to you. If you value your life, then hurry. You will die if you stay here, Master Emiya."[lr]::
67041::$$$message_0621_0024_0003$$$::Sella gives me a courteous farewell bow.::
67042::$$$message_0621_0025_0000$$$::"Hey, wait! Hold on, Sella!"[lr]::
67043::$$$message_0621_0025_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
67044::$$$message_0621_0025_0002$$$::Sella stops and looks at me. She seems surprised that I used her name.::
67045::$$$message_0621_0026_0000$$$::"Was there anything else? I must decline to provide you with the locations of my mistress or your friend. I was asked only to deliver a message."[lr]::
67046::$$$message_0621_0026_0001$$$::Sella cuts me off coolly.[lr]::
67047::$$$message_0621_0026_0002$$$::...Seeing the way she acts, I falter.::
67048::$$$message_0621_0027_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67049::$$$message_0621_0027_0001$$$::I gasp, but not because of her attitude.[lr]::
67050::$$$message_0621_0027_0002$$$::...They're so similar.[lr]::
67051::$$$message_0621_0027_0003$$$::I'm not sure why I think so, but Sella resembles Illya.[lr]::
67052::$$$message_0621_0027_0004$$$::Her face, demeanor, build, and age are all different, but I can't help but see them as sisters.::
67053::$$$message_0621_0028_0000$$$::"...If that is all, then farewell. I ask that you do not waste Lady Illyasviel's goodwill."::
67054::$$$message_0621_0029_0000$$$::"Ah... It's not like that, Sella. I'm here to help Illya, but I don't want to cause trouble for you.[lr]::
67055::$$$message_0621_0029_0001$$$::It's your job to take care of her, right? Then you know that we need to rescue her from this castle."::
67056::$$$message_0621_0030_0000$$$::"You forget your place.[lr]::
67057::$$$message_0621_0030_0001$$$::But you are correct. As you say, my mistress must escape this place as soon as possible."[lr]::
67058::$$$message_0621_0030_0002$$$::Yeah! So tell me where[line2]::
67059::$$$message_0621_0031_0000$$$::"I cannot do that. Even if I told you, it would be futile."[lr]::
67060::$$$message_0621_0031_0001$$$::Sella quietly leaves.::
67061::$$$message_0621_0032_0000$$$::"Hey, wait! I'm...!"[lr]::
67062::$$$message_0621_0032_0001$$$::It happens in an instant.[lr]::
67063::$$$message_0621_0032_0002$$$::A pitch-black dagger flies at me from where Sella was just standing.::
67064::$$$message_0621_0033_0000$$$::"Mmph, ah..."[lr]::
67065::$$$message_0621_0033_0001$$$::I stagger.[lr]::
67066::$$$message_0621_0033_0002$$$::Blinded by the pain, I retreat to the window.[lr]::
67067::$$$message_0621_0033_0003$$$::In front of me,[lr]::
67068::$$$message_0621_0033_0004$$$::floats a white skull mask.::
67069::$$$message_0621_0034_0000$$$::"Hah... nrgh...!"[lr]::
67070::$$$message_0621_0034_0001$$$::I feel for the window with my hand.[lr]::
67071::$$$message_0621_0034_0002$$$::...But what will I do if I find it?[lr]::
67072::$$$message_0621_0034_0003$$$::This is the fourth floor, and there's a knife deep in my chest.[lr]::
67073::$$$message_0621_0034_0004$$$::I'm losing so much blood that I probably won't even last another minute.::
67074::$$$message_0621_0035_0000$$$::"You actually came alone, you despicable fool."[lr]::
67075::$$$message_0621_0035_0001$$$::"...Haah..."[lr]::
67076::$$$message_0621_0035_0002$$$::"I am not like my Lord Mage. I will put you out of your misery quickly."::
67077::$$$message_0621_0036_0000$$$::"...Guh...!"[lr]::
67078::$$$message_0621_0036_0001$$$::I wrench myself towards the windowsill.[lr]::
67079::$$$message_0621_0036_0002$$$::I don't care that I'm on the fourth floor.[lr]::
67080::$$$message_0621_0036_0003$$$::I try to run from the reaper closing in on me...[lr]::
67081::$$$message_0621_0036_0004$$$::...but as soon as I reach for the window, a blade slides into my neck.::
67082::$$$message_0621_0037_0000$$$::The skull goes blurry.[lr]::
67083::$$$message_0621_0037_0001$$$::"Sleep now. It may not save you from your sorry state, but it is still far better than being eaten by that monster."[lr]::
67084::$$$message_0621_0037_0002$$$::My vision grows dim.::
67085::$$$message_0621_0038_0000$$$::...On the cusp of death, I feel regret.[lr]::
67086::$$$message_0621_0038_0001$$$::Even if I was in a race against time, it was still too reckless to come alone.::
