51668::$$$message_0445_0000_0000$$$::    She weaves her way through an unnatural darkness.[lr]::
51669::$$$message_0445_0000_0001$$$::A desolate night.[lr]::
51670::$$$message_0445_0000_0002$$$::While the moonlight shines, she makes her way through the dark hallway and enters a room.::
51671::$$$message_0445_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51672::$$$message_0445_0001_0001$$$::This is a room of a random building.[lr]::
51673::$$$message_0445_0001_0002$$$::There are about fifty workers here.[lr]::
51674::$$$message_0445_0001_0003$$$::Most of them are male, and they are scattered like puppets with their strings severed.::
51675::$$$message_0445_0001_0004$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51676::$$$message_0445_0001_0005$$$::She grits her teeth.[lr]::
51677::$$$message_0445_0001_0006$$$::It helps that the darkness limits her vision.[lr]::
51678::$$$message_0445_0001_0007$$$::The rotten air is from a plant's smell that turned into smoke and filled the air.::
51679::$$$message_0445_0001_0008$$$::"...What is this scent? Can you tell, Archer?"[lr]::
51680::$$$message_0445_0001_0009$$$::Opening the door and windows, she asks someone behind her.[lr]::
51681::$$$message_0445_0001_0010$$$::There is no one there.[lr]::
51682::$$$message_0445_0001_0011$$$::But in the shroud of smoke, a strong presence wavers.::
51683::$$$message_0445_0001_0012$$$::"It must be witch's ointment[line2]the kind made from umbellifers that destroys love."[lr]::
51684::$$$message_0445_0001_0013$$$::"That's hemlock, right? Destroys love... Oh, I see. I wonder if the instigator of this has some grudge against men."::
51685::$$$message_0445_0001_0014$$$::"If so, it must be a woman. I don't know what kind of grudge, but it must be deep-rooted to take it out on people even after becoming a Servant."[lr]::
51686::$$$message_0445_0001_0015$$$::"Stop mansplaining and open the windows... They're still breathing. At this rate, it doesn't matter whether we call for help now or if they are found in the morning.[lr]::
51687::$$$message_0445_0001_0016$$$::Let's leave as soon as we're done here, Archer."::
51688::$$$message_0445_0001_0017$$$::She opens all the windows on one side, treats the people in especially bad condition, and leaves the room.[lr]::
51689::$$$message_0445_0001_0018$$$::"...Ugh. I have to take my clothes to the dry cleaner's."[lr]::
51690::$$$message_0445_0001_0019$$$::She sniffs her coat.[lr]::
51691::$$$message_0445_0001_0020$$$::Though she was careful not to touch things for the most part, the scent of rust still made it onto her.[lr]::
51692::$$$message_0445_0001_0021$$$::The room was sealed.[lr]::
51693::$$$message_0445_0001_0022$$$::And the floor of that room was covered in the blood that fifty or so people threw up.::
51694::$$$message_0445_0001_0023$$$::The presence behind her takes form.[lr]::
51695::$$$message_0445_0001_0024$$$::What appears behind her is a knight in red.[lr]::
51696::$$$message_0445_0001_0025$$$::He is Archer, the Servant who was protecting Rin Tohsaka in spirit form.::
51697::$$$message_0445_0002_0000$$$::"So? Are they flowing towards Ryudou Temple?"[lr]::
51698::$$$message_0445_0002_0001$$$::"...Yeah. All the life energy that was taken is flowing towards the mountain. The coma incidents happening in Shinto are caused by whoever is at the temple. I don't know about the Master, but such a thing is beyond human power. If there's anyone capable of doing it, it'd be the Servant Caster."[lr]::
51699::$$$message_0445_0002_0002$$$::"A witch at Ryudou Temple, huh? ...In that case, we made a blunder last night."::
51700::$$$message_0445_0003_0000$$$::"A blunder...? You mean how we called it a tie with Berserker? I think that was the best possible outcome."[lr]::
51701::$$$message_0445_0003_0001$$$::"I don't know about that. If Caster has such a large network, I'm sure she saw last night's battle.[lr]::
51702::$$$message_0445_0003_0002$$$::But despite that, we could not defeat Berserker, we let Saber go, and we gave away the scope of our power. What part of all that is good for us?"[lr]::
51703::$$$message_0445_0003_0003$$$::His tone is biting and sarcastic.[lr]::
51704::$$$message_0445_0003_0004$$$::But Rin does not answer.::
51705::$$$message_0445_0004_0000$$$::It was not a mistake to drive Berserker away and help Saber.[lr]::
51706::$$$message_0445_0004_0001$$$::And most importantly...Archer hasn't shown the full scope of his power yet.[lr]::
51707::$$$message_0445_0004_0002$$$::Last night...[lr]::
51708::$$$message_0445_0004_0003$$$::It is true that the arrow Archer fired stopped Berserker.[lr]::
51709::$$$message_0445_0004_0004$$$::But even Rin, his Master, has yet to find out his identity...or the identity of that powerful Noble Phantasm.::
51710::$$$message_0445_0005_0000$$$::"...Rin."[lr]::
51711::$$$message_0445_0005_0001$$$::...No, she knows the principle behind it.[lr]::
51712::$$$message_0445_0005_0002$$$::It was just a bomb.[lr]::
51713::$$$message_0445_0005_0003$$$::He just detonated a bomb called a Noble Phantasm in front of his enemy.[lr]::
51714::$$$message_0445_0005_0004$$$::It goes without saying how exceptional it was.[lr]::
51715::$$$message_0445_0005_0005$$$::That was a one-time explosion of magical energy, created using the most powerful of illusions, a Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
51716::$$$message_0445_0005_0006$$$::Broken Phantasm.[lr]::
51717::$$$message_0445_0005_0007$$$::That is what the red knight's deadly Noble Phantasm is called.::
51718::$$$message_0445_0006_0000$$$::"...Rin."[lr]::
51719::$$$message_0445_0006_0001$$$::...Though that itself is also strange.[lr]::
51720::$$$message_0445_0006_0002$$$::Servants typically only wield one Noble Phantasm, and it is a part of them that they have had in their past life. What kind of Heroic Spirit would destroy such a thing so freely? ::
51721::$$$message_0445_0007_0000$$$::"...Rin."[lr]::
51722::$$$message_0445_0007_0001$$$::It is not easy to fix a Noble Phantasm that has been destroyed.[lr]::
51723::$$$message_0445_0007_0002$$$::It's like committing suicide for a Servant to destroy their own.::
51724::$$$message_0445_0008_0000$$$::"...Rin."[lr]::
51725::$$$message_0445_0008_0001$$$::In other words, Archer abandoned his strongest weapon in a situation where he still had six enemies he needed to defeat.[lr]::
51726::$$$message_0445_0008_0002$$$::No, more than that, other Servants would faint if they found out he destroyed his own Noble Phantasm. It is their proof as a hero[line2]::
51727::$$$message_0445_0009_0000$$$::"Rin!"[lr]::
51728::$$$message_0445_0009_0001$$$::"Oh, what? Sorry, I wasn't listening."[lr]::
51729::$$$message_0445_0009_0002$$$::"...I asked what we are going to do. You must be tired from the previous battle, so we should go back and get some rest."[lr]::
51730::$$$message_0445_0009_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51731::$$$message_0445_0009_0004$$$::Rin clenches her fist in response to Archer's words.::
51732::$$$message_0445_0010_0000$$$::The previous battle...[lr]::
51733::$$$message_0445_0010_0001$$$::A large number of skeleton golems wriggling in the hallway.[lr]::
51734::$$$message_0445_0010_0002$$$::All of them were destroyed by her own hand.::
51735::$$$message_0445_0011_0000$$$::She didn't need Archer's help and didn't want to expose Archer's abilities over something like that.[lr]::
51736::$$$message_0445_0011_0001$$$::More importantly, she felt anger towards enemies who break the rules as a mage and involve innocent people.[lr]::
51737::$$$message_0445_0011_0002$$$::That's why she destroyed them.[lr]::
51738::$$$message_0445_0011_0003$$$::She beat them without mercy until there was nothing left.[lr]::
51739::$$$message_0445_0011_0004$$$::...She did not show any sympathy, even if the bones were someone that could have been alive until just the other day.::
51740::$$$message_0445_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51741::$$$message_0445_0012_0001$$$::She did not suffer any wounds from this battle.[lr]::
51742::$$$message_0445_0012_0002$$$::Except one.[lr]::
51743::$$$message_0445_0012_0003$$$::She fought and kept the nausea from overwhelming her. In exchange, she bit her lip so hard it bled.::
51744::$$$message_0445_0013_0000$$$::"...We're going after Caster. You can still feel her presence, right? We'll get things over with before she escapes to Ryudou Temple."[lr]::
51745::$$$message_0445_0013_0001$$$::"What? I'm surprised. Wasn't it your principle to not do things that you don't think you can do?"[lr]::
51746::$$$message_0445_0013_0002$$$::"...That's right. I can't do things where I know the outcome.[lr]::
51747::$$$message_0445_0013_0003$$$::But that's different. If we go after her right now, I'm sure we'll be able to find some clue, and most of all[line2]"::
51748::$$$message_0445_0014_0000$$$::"...You can't stand without starting a fight, huh?[lr]::
51749::$$$message_0445_0014_0001$$$::Good grief. You're letting the easy opponents run loose and going after the hardest opponent to defeat?"[lr]::
51750::$$$message_0445_0014_0002$$$::"...Mm. It's fine, let Saber be. We can finish them off at anytime, so we don't have to worry about them.[lr]::
51751::$$$message_0445_0014_0003$$$::We don't have to go out of our way if they're not going to do anything. As long as he's hiding at home, I'll let him be."::
51752::$$$message_0445_0015_0000$$$::"...Hm. So, will it be a different story if that Master is in front of you? For example, if Shirou Emiya were to appear in front of you, without any self-awareness as Master..."[lr]::
51753::$$$message_0445_0015_0001$$$::Those words are as if to test her.[lr]::
51754::$$$message_0445_0015_0002$$$::In a voice without emotion, looking down at the night town...[lr]::
51755::$$$message_0445_0015_0003$$$::"...I'll kill him.[lr]::
51756::$$$message_0445_0015_0004$$$::I have no obligation towards someone who doesn't know something like that."[lr]::
51757::$$$message_0445_0015_0005$$$::Rin Tohsaka asserts, as if to convince herself.::
