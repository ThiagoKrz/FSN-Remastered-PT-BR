57903::$$$message_0515_0001_0000$$$::"...Really?"[lr]::
57904::$$$message_0515_0001_0001$$$::"Er, I've never had a little sister before, it'll be fun. And I won't mention what happened the other night... That's all I can promise you. Can you trust me?"::
57905::$$$message_0515_0002_0000$$$::"Yeah![lr]::
57906::$$$message_0515_0002_0001$$$::If you say so, I'll trust you, Shirou!"[lr]::

57909::$$$message_0515_0003_0001$$$::So I grumble, but this isn't so bad, I reassure myself.::
57910::$$$message_0515_0004_0000$$$::Right now, Illya has no ill will towards me.[lr]::
57911::$$$message_0515_0004_0001$$$::I'm not going to fall over from a hug, either. And if I lose my cool here, I'd be a failure of a big brother.[lr]::
57912::$$$message_0515_0004_0002$$$::As long as I've got her here, I'll have an easygoing chat with her, just like she wants.:ÂÖ¨
