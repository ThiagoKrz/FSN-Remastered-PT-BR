45536::$$$message_0403_0000_0000$$$::"Ungh... Haah..."[lr]::
45537::$$$message_0403_0000_0001$$$::I feel dizzy.[lr]::
45538::$$$message_0403_0000_0002$$$::My body can't hold out any longer.[lr]::
45539::$$$message_0403_0000_0003$$$::...I'm going to die.[lr]::
45540::$$$message_0403_0000_0004$$$::I can't endure it in the very end.::
45541::$$$message_0403_0000_0005$$$::Then, if I can't endure it anyway, should I loosen up?[lr]::
45542::$$$message_0403_0000_0006$$$::If I do so, I should at least be able to push him back into that void...::
45543::$$$message_0403_0001_0000$$$::"No, don't underestimate me...! I won't let you take me with you...!"[lr]::
45544::$$$message_0403_0001_0001$$$::I re-energize my weakening limbs.[lr]::
45545::$$$message_0403_0001_0002$$$::Will my arm tear off first, will his chain rip off first, or will he crawl out first?[lr]::
45546::$$$message_0403_0001_0003$$$::It doesn't matter. I'll fight until the very end and die a flashy death...!::
45547::$$$message_0403_0002_0000$$$::"...Heh. You can do as you wish, but dodge to the right before that."::
45548::$$$message_0403_0003_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
45549::$$$message_0403_0003_0001$$$::I turn around immediately.[lr]::
45550::$$$message_0403_0003_0002$$$::I look at the temple grounds in the distance, which has become a wasteland.[lr]::
45551::$$$message_0403_0003_0003$$$::    Something flies by, as if brushing past me.::
45552::$$$message_0403_0004_0000$$$::"You... Ar...cher..."[lr]::
45553::$$$message_0403_0004_0001$$$::...The chain comes off.[lr]::
45554::$$$message_0403_0004_0002$$$::In the end...[lr]::
45555::$$$message_0403_0004_0003$$$::Looking like he saw something unexpected, he lets go of the Chain of the Heavens.::
45556::$$$message_0403_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45557::$$$message_0403_0005_0001$$$::I fall on my butt.[lr]::
45558::$$$message_0403_0005_0002$$$::The void shrinks to the size of my palm and vanishes as I look on, dumbfounded.::
45559::$$$message_0403_0006_0000$$$::"That... was..."[lr]::
45560::$$$message_0403_0006_0001$$$::Unable to even stand, I look at the wasteland behind me.[lr]::
45561::$$$message_0403_0006_0002$$$::    Dawn is near.[lr]::
45562::$$$message_0403_0006_0003$$$::The one with the rising sun behind him is the knight wearing a red cloak.::
45563::$$$message_0403_0007_0000$$$::"What a... show-off."[lr]::
45564::$$$message_0403_0007_0001$$$::I subconsciously complain.[lr]::
45565::$$$message_0403_0007_0002$$$::But, I can't help but smile happily.::
45566::$$$message_0403_0008_0000$$$::"...Heh. Well..."[lr]::
45567::$$$message_0403_0008_0001$$$::I have nothing I want to say, so I'll keep quiet so that I can sleep.::
45568::$$$message_0403_0009_0000$$$::The golden ground that became a wasteland.[lr]::
45569::$$$message_0403_0009_0001$$$::Seeing the knight stand there and Tohsaka running to him, I lie down on the ground.[lr]::
45570::$$$message_0403_0009_0002$$$::Tohsaka should say everything I want to say to him on my behalf.::
45571::$$$message_0403_0010_0000$$$::   So, I'll sleep for now.[lr]::
45572::$$$message_0403_0010_0001$$$::I'm sure we'll end up fighting if we see each other again, and I'm not used to saying farewell to myself.::
45573::$$$message_0403_0011_0000$$$::...And for the final time...[lr]::
45574::$$$message_0403_0011_0001$$$::I engrave my ideal into my mind so that I won't forget it and slowly close my eyes.::
45575::$$$message_0403_0012_0000$$$::The ground that he stands on is similar to the wasteland that I saw before.[lr]::
45576::$$$message_0403_0012_0001$$$::There is nothing around.[lr]::
45577::$$$message_0403_0012_0002$$$::There is nothing extra on this summit where everything was blown away.[lr]::
45578::$$$message_0403_0012_0003$$$::    The battle has ended.::
45579::$$$message_0403_0013_0000$$$::The battle for the Holy Grail has ended, and the curtain is about to fall on his battle as well.[lr]::
45580::$$$message_0403_0013_0001$$$::He does not know how long it was.[lr]::
45581::$$$message_0403_0013_0002$$$::But the accumulated wish that should have bound him forever is gone now.[lr]::
45582::$$$message_0403_0013_0003$$$::The end quickly permeates into him and melts this era's version of his body.::
45583::$$$message_0403_0014_0000$$$::"Archer...!"[lr]::
45584::$$$message_0403_0014_0001$$$::He looks towards the voice calling him.[lr]::
45585::$$$message_0403_0014_0002$$$::That girl must not have the spare energy to run, but she runs to him, breathing unsteadily.[lr]::
45586::$$$message_0403_0014_0003$$$::He quietly watches her.::
45587::$$$message_0403_0015_0000$$$::"Haah, haah, haah, haah...!"[lr]::
45588::$$$message_0403_0015_0001$$$::The girl that ran up to him looks up at the knight, still breathing unsteadily.::
45589::$$$message_0403_0016_0000$$$::   The red cloak flowing in the wind shows no trace of what it used to be.[lr]::
45590::$$$message_0403_0016_0001$$$::It is torn everywhere, and his armor is cracked and broken.[lr]::
45591::$$$message_0403_0016_0002$$$::His existence is weak.[lr]::
45592::$$$message_0403_0016_0003$$$::The knight that stands still with haughtiness, just like the time they first met, starts to disappear from his feet up.::
45593::$$$message_0403_0017_0000$$$::"Ar...cher..."[lr]::
45594::$$$message_0403_0017_0001$$$::Dawn approaches in the distance.[lr]::
45595::$$$message_0403_0017_0002$$$::The golden sun rises faintly from the horizon.::
45596::$$$message_0403_0018_0000$$$::"Too bad. Well, that's what happened. Give up the Holy Grail this time, Rin."[lr]::
45597::$$$message_0403_0018_0001$$$::Does he not have anything special to say?[lr]::
45598::$$$message_0403_0018_0002$$$::The red knight says a trivial thing like that.::
45599::$$$message_0403_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45600::$$$message_0403_0019_0001$$$::That gets the girl all the more.[lr]::
45601::$$$message_0403_0019_0002$$$::With that body that was about to disappear, the knight was the same knight as before.[lr]::
45602::$$$message_0403_0019_0003$$$::An ally that she trusted and ran through the night with, who had her back while making sarcastic remarks.[lr]::
45603::$$$message_0403_0019_0004$$$::She can declare that those memories were fun, looking back at them.::
45604::$$$message_0403_0020_0000$$$::    And they are still in front of her, unchanged.[lr]::
45605::$$$message_0403_0020_0001$$$::He remained to save her at the last moment.[lr]::
45606::$$$message_0403_0020_0002$$$::He lost his Master and withstood the Noble Phantasm of the King of Heroes.[lr]::
45607::$$$message_0403_0020_0003$$$::His body was disappearing, but he didn't ask for her help and watched over their battle.[lr]::
45608::$$$message_0403_0020_0004$$$::That end is in front of her.::
45609::$$$message_0403_0021_0000$$$::"Archer."[lr]::
45610::$$$message_0403_0021_0001$$$::The girl can't think of what she should say.[lr]::
45611::$$$message_0403_0021_0002$$$::It is always like that for her at the most crucial times.[lr]::
45612::$$$message_0403_0021_0003$$$::She loses her quick-wittedness when she needs it the most.::
45613::$$$message_0403_0022_0000$$$::"Ha..."[lr]::
45614::$$$message_0403_0022_0001$$$::The knight smiles slightly.[lr]::
45615::$$$message_0403_0022_0002$$$::He knew that from the start.[lr]::
45616::$$$message_0403_0022_0003$$$::The girl's clumsiness is a memory more fond than anything to the knight in red.::
45617::$$$message_0403_0023_0000$$$::"...W-What? Now's not the time to be laughing!"[lr]::
45618::$$$message_0403_0023_0001$$$::She looks up at the knight, annoyed.[lr]::
45619::$$$message_0403_0023_0002$$$::"Oh, sorry. It's just the way you looked.[lr]::
45620::$$$message_0403_0023_0003$$$::I was just stunned at how worn out we both look."[lr]::
45621::$$$message_0403_0023_0004$$$::He still has a smile even as he banters.::
45622::$$$message_0403_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45623::$$$message_0403_0024_0001$$$::She gets a lump in her throat from seeing his face free of regrets.[lr]::
45624::$$$message_0403_0024_0002$$$::She wonders if it's okay.[lr]::
45625::$$$message_0403_0024_0003$$$::The moment she wonders if it's okay for him to disappear like this...[lr]::
45626::$$$message_0403_0024_0004$$$::"Archer. Form a contract with me again."[lr]::
45627::$$$message_0403_0024_0005$$$::She says those words that she shouldn't say.::
45628::$$$message_0403_0025_0000$$$::"I cannot do that. I do not know if you plan to continue your contract with Saber, but I do not have the right to.[lr]::
45629::$$$message_0403_0025_0001$$$::And I have no objective anymore. My battle ends here."[lr]::
45630::$$$message_0403_0025_0002$$$::His answer has no doubt, and his will is pure.[lr]::
45631::$$$message_0403_0025_0003$$$::His face is as bright as the sunrise, and how can she force him when he's making a face like that?::
45632::$$$message_0403_0026_0000$$$::"...But! But, then.[lr]::
45633::$$$message_0403_0026_0001$$$::You will never..."[lr]::
45634::$$$message_0403_0026_0002$$$::...Be saved.[lr]::
45635::$$$message_0403_0026_0003$$$::The girl swallows her words and looks down.[lr]::
45636::$$$message_0403_0026_0004$$$::That is not something the girl should say and it wouldn't be granted even if she kept the knight in this world.::
45637::$$$message_0403_0027_0000$$$::"...I'm troubled. I don't have any attachments to this world, but..."[lr]::
45638::$$$message_0403_0027_0001$$$::It's troubling to have this girl cry.[lr]::
45639::$$$message_0403_0027_0002$$$::For him, the girl always has to be positive, realistic, and indulgent.[lr]::
45640::$$$message_0403_0027_0003$$$::He was always encouraged by her.[lr]::
45641::$$$message_0403_0027_0004$$$::That's why he wanted this girl to be her usual self until the very end.::
45642::$$$message_0403_0028_0000$$$::"...Rin."[lr]::
45643::$$$message_0403_0028_0001$$$::The girl looks up at the sound of his voice.[lr]::
45644::$$$message_0403_0028_0002$$$::Her face trying to hold back her tears is adorable. [lr]::
45645::$$$message_0403_0028_0003$$$::Rather than expressing the slight attachment that he feels, he looks at the collapsed boy in the distance.[lr]::
45646::$$$message_0403_0028_0004$$$::"Please take care of me. I am an unreliable guy, as you know.[lr]::
45647::$$$message_0403_0028_0005$$$::   Please support me."[lr]::
45648::$$$message_0403_0028_0006$$$::The knight says objectively.::
45649::$$$message_0403_0029_0000$$$::Those are words of farewell.[lr]::
45650::$$$message_0403_0029_0001$$$::...The future might change.[lr]::
45651::$$$message_0403_0029_0002$$$::If a girl like her stays by Shirou Emiya's side, then the hero named Emiya will not be born.[lr]::
45652::$$$message_0403_0029_0003$$$::His distant words contain such hope.::
45653::$$$message_0403_0030_0000$$$::"...Ar...cher."[lr]::
45654::$$$message_0403_0030_0001$$$::...But, even if that were to happen, even then... The knight in red that already exists will forever be a Guardian.[lr]::
45655::$$$message_0403_0030_0002$$$::He and the boy are different existences.[lr]::
45656::$$$message_0403_0030_0003$$$::They only have the same starting point, and he was an illusion that the boy dreamt of.::
45657::$$$message_0403_0031_0000$$$::"...Oh."[lr]::
45658::$$$message_0403_0031_0001$$$::...There is no salvation available for this knight anymore.[lr]::
45659::$$$message_0403_0031_0002$$$::There is nothing to give to him, as he has already died and become a phenomenon.[lr]::
45660::$$$message_0403_0031_0003$$$::The girl nods in spite of that.[lr]::
45661::$$$message_0403_0031_0004$$$::Because she cannot give him anything, she gives him the biggest smile in the end.[lr]::
45662::$$$message_0403_0031_0005$$$::He asks her to take care of him.[lr]::
45663::$$$message_0403_0031_0006$$$::In order to answer the trust that he put in her...::
45664::$$$message_0403_0031_0007$$$::"Yeah, I know. I'll do my best. I'll do my best so he won't become twisted like you. I'll do my best so that he'll be able to like himself...![lr]::
45665::$$$message_0403_0031_0008$$$::So, you should also..."[lr]::
45666::$$$message_0403_0031_0009$$$::   Forgive yourself.[lr]::
45667::$$$message_0403_0031_0010$$$::She doesn't put it into words.[lr]::
45668::$$$message_0403_0031_0011$$$::The girl looks up at the disappearing knight with a flood of emotions.::
45669::$$$message_0403_0032_0000$$$::    How much salvation did that bring?[lr]::
45670::$$$message_0403_0032_0001$$$::After engraving the girl's smile into his memory with pride...::
45671::$$$message_0403_0033_0000$$$::"I got my answer. It's all right, Tohsaka. I'll do my best from now on too."::
45672::$$$message_0403_0034_0000$$$::A breeze.[lr]::
45673::$$$message_0403_0034_0001$$$::The knight finally rests his wounded body, without waiting for the girl's reply.::
45674::$$$message_0403_0035_0000$$$::"...Humph. I didn't get to complain to you after all."[lr]::
45675::$$$message_0403_0035_0001$$$::She wipes her tears as they well up and says to the man who is no longer there.[lr]::
45676::$$$message_0403_0035_0002$$$::That voice is invigorated, and she regains her usual stoutheartedness.[lr]::
45677::$$$message_0403_0035_0003$$$::It is only natural.[lr]::
45678::$$$message_0403_0035_0004$$$::She doesn't have the time to be down after he made a face like that.[lr]::
45679::$$$message_0403_0035_0005$$$::She says farewell to the wasteland where the knight stood, and the girl runs down to the collapsed boy.::
45680::$$$message_0403_0036_0000$$$::   In the golden sunlight...[lr]::
45681::$$$message_0403_0036_0001$$$::   His smile as he disappeared was just like the boy's from the past.::b‡
