69074::$$$message_0632_0000_0000$$$::   I can't allow myself to die here.[lr]::
69075::$$$message_0632_0000_0001$$$::It's two meters to the door.[lr]::
69076::$$$message_0632_0000_0002$$$::I can escape in a single bound.[lr]::
69077::$$$message_0632_0000_0003$$$::The problem is that Rider can close in on me faster than I can leap back.::
69078::$$$message_0632_0001_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
69079::$$$message_0632_0001_0001$$$::I can't tell if there's anger or disappointment behind Rider's bloodlust.[lr]::
69080::$$$message_0632_0001_0002$$$::Maybe it's just the poor lighting in the shed, but standing in the dark, she reminds me of a giant snake about to strike its prey.::
69081::$$$message_0632_0002_0000$$$::"[line5], [line7]"[lr]::
69082::$$$message_0632_0002_0001$$$::I focus on predicting when the snake will strike.::
69083::$$$message_0632_0002_0002$$$::"...Haah...!"[lr]::
69084::$$$message_0632_0002_0003$$$::I dodge a dagger before I jump back.::
69085::$$$message_0632_0003_0000$$$::"I made it...!"[lr]::
69086::$$$message_0632_0003_0001$$$::I feel a little excited as I run into the yard.[lr]::
69087::$$$message_0632_0003_0002$$$::My heartbeat rises with the exhilaration of avoiding Rider's daggers and taking the opportunity to escape, when she's stronger than me.::
69088::$$$message_0632_0004_0000$$$::But my happiness ends there.[lr]::
69089::$$$message_0632_0004_0001$$$::The fight has just begun. I need to find some way to beat Rider, or else...::
69090::$$$message_0632_0005_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
69091::$$$message_0632_0005_0001$$$::Nobody's chasing me...?[lr]::
69092::$$$message_0632_0005_0002$$$::Rider slowly emerges from the shed.[lr]::
69093::$$$message_0632_0005_0003$$$::"...You have lost my interest. You cannot kill Sakura with your meager skills. I don't even need to finish you off."[lr]::
69094::$$$message_0632_0005_0004$$$::Then, she vanishes into the night as suddenly as she appeared.::
69095::$$$message_0632_0006_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
69096::$$$message_0632_0006_0001$$$::Rider's presence fades away.[lr]::
69097::$$$message_0632_0006_0002$$$::She must have left the house.[lr]::
69098::$$$message_0632_0006_0003$$$::Her bloodlust is gone, and it doesn't seem like it'll ever return.::
69099::$$$message_0632_0007_0000$$$::"...Rider..."[lr]::
69100::$$$message_0632_0007_0001$$$::Did she...let me go?[lr]::
69101::$$$message_0632_0007_0002$$$::Unless I'm imagining it, she might have offered to help me if I'd given her a chance...::
