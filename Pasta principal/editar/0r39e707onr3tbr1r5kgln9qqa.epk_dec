30699::$$$message_0243_0000_0000$$$::What came back to me was a distant memory.[lr]::
30700::$$$message_0243_0000_0001$$$::It was a sign that he should have forgotten and discarded...something that should not have returned.::
30701::$$$message_0243_0001_0000$$$::The sparks from swords clashing.[lr]::
30702::$$$message_0243_0001_0001$$$::Swords pressing against each other.[lr]::
30703::$$$message_0243_0001_0002$$$::Dozens of premature and immature attacks and defenses are exchanged.[lr]::
30704::$$$message_0243_0001_0003$$$::The match couldn't even be called an elegant exchange of swords; it's a clumsy melee of each side denying the other.[lr]::
30705::$$$message_0243_0001_0004$$$::So how did this once worn-out vow get revived?::
30706::$$$message_0243_0002_0000$$$::                                  It is an unbelievable fight between swords.::
30707::$$$message_0243_0003_0000$$$:: He charges in, despite being fully wounded.[lr]::
30708::$$$message_0243_0003_0001$$$::His fingers broken, limbs ripped...and the boy doesn't even realize it, but his breathing had long since stopped.[lr]::
30709::$$$message_0243_0003_0002$$$::The speed is insignificant, and the blows he delivers are mediocre.[lr]::
30710::$$$message_0243_0003_0003$$$::Even though he absorbed his knowledge and reached a point where he could withstand battle, he is back to being as clumsy as he was before.::
30711::$$$message_0243_0004_0000$$$::He executes a haphazard, mediocre attack.[lr]::
30712::$$$message_0243_0004_0001$$$::However...[lr]::
30713::$$$message_0243_0004_0002$$$::That first blow is heavier than any of the other attacks before.::
30714::$$$message_0243_0005_0000$$$::There is no such thing as a hero of justice.[lr]::
30715::$$$message_0243_0005_0001$$$::Knowing better than anyone else that his ideals are false, he silences that thought.[lr]::
30716::$$$message_0243_0005_0002$$$::His distorted mind can't bear it, and collapses.[lr]::
30717::$$$message_0243_0005_0003$$$::It's clear to the boy that his own contradictions are going to eat him up.::
30718::$$$message_0243_0006_0000$$$::But he shows no indication that he's going to submit.[lr]::
30719::$$$message_0243_0006_0001$$$::There is no sign of falsehood in him as he wields the blade while his body is torn apart and his mental state dissolves.::
30720::$$$message_0243_0007_0000$$$::The intensity of this conflict is incomparable to anything in the past.[lr]::
30721::$$$message_0243_0007_0001$$$::The boy swings his sword foolhardily.[lr]::
30722::$$$message_0243_0007_0002$$$::The two sides struggle.[lr]::
30723::$$$message_0243_0007_0003$$$::The space is filled with sparks, and anything that tries to intervene is instantly cut to pieces.[lr]::
30724::$$$message_0243_0007_0004$$$::It is the embodiment of the two parties' minds, which were repelling each other, yet melding together.::
30725::$$$message_0243_0008_0000$$$::A decisive blow is struck.[lr]::
30726::$$$message_0243_0008_0001$$$::It is simply the final spark and ember emitted by a person in their last moments.[lr]::
30727::$$$message_0243_0008_0002$$$::The boy gasps and nearly falls over with each blow, then steps back and swings his sword again.::
30728::$$$message_0243_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]......[font italic=false][lr]::
30729::$$$message_0243_0009_0001$$$::Seeing that, he is convinced.[lr]::
30730::$$$message_0243_0009_0002$$$::His enemy doesn't have any strength left.[lr]::
30731::$$$message_0243_0009_0003$$$::The boy in front of him is on the verge of death...corpse-like.[lr]::
30732::$$$message_0243_0009_0004$$$::And yet...[lr]::
30733::$$$message_0243_0009_0005$$$::Yet why does the boy continue to wield the sword, as if he has infinite strength?::
30734::$$$message_0243_0010_0000$$$::He briefly sees a vision.[lr]::
30735::$$$message_0243_0010_0001$$$::He must have gotten tired of seeing his opponent swing his sword despite knowing that it was pointless.[lr]::
30736::$$$message_0243_0010_0002$$$::Irritation[line2]the most abhorrent impulses well up within him.::
30737::$$$message_0243_0011_0000$$$::What did he feel was beautiful and noble?::
30738::$$$message_0243_0012_0000$$$::The boy says...[lr]::
30739::$$$message_0243_0012_0001$$$::He doesn't want to see people die meaninglessly.[lr]::
30740::$$$message_0243_0012_0002$$$::If it's possible...is there a way to save everybody who is suffering?::
30741::$$$message_0243_0013_0000$$$::Of course not.[lr]::
30742::$$$message_0243_0013_0001$$$::He knows a wish like that is meaningless hypocrisy.[lr]::
30743::$$$message_0243_0013_0002$$$::The idea that others are more important than oneself is not something that should ever cross one's mind.::
30744::$$$message_0243_0014_0000$$$::However...[lr]::
30745::$$$message_0243_0014_0001$$$::How wonderful would it be to be able to live like that? How great would it be to hold such an ideal like that!?::
30746::$$$message_0243_0015_0000$$$::"......!"[lr]::
30747::$$$message_0243_0015_0001$$$::He can't hear what his enemy is saying.[lr]::
30748::$$$message_0243_0015_0002$$$::His enemy's voice is so weak, yet the sword he wields is fierce.[lr]::
30749::$$$message_0243_0015_0003$$$::Looking closer, the boy's hands gripping the sword have melded with the hilt.[lr]::
30750::$$$message_0243_0015_0004$$$::He must have done it to secure the sword, but by doing that, he will directly feel the impact from the sword.[lr]::
30751::$$$message_0243_0015_0005$$$::The boy is covered with blood, and if he retreats even a step back, he will fall forward as a corpse.[lr]::
30752::$$$message_0243_0015_0006$$$::Every attack the boy executes must be equivalent to agony in hell.::
30753::$$$message_0243_0016_0000$$$::"......!"[lr]::
30754::$$$message_0243_0016_0001$$$::The boy's voice is inaudible.[lr]::
30755::$$$message_0243_0016_0002$$$::The boy who's on the brink of death, frantically goes up against the obstacle before him.[lr]::
30756::$$$message_0243_0016_0003$$$::The man does not need to be told what drives the boy to continue moving.::
30757::$$$message_0243_0017_0000$$$::                                  It's a bad dream.[lr]::
30758::$$$message_0243_0017_0001$$$::                                  The man is shown a reflection of his past.::
30759::$$$message_0243_0018_0000$$$::The boy continues to swing with his shredded arm.[lr]::
30760::$$$message_0243_0018_0001$$$::The only thing that can be heard is a strained yell.[lr]::
30761::$$$message_0243_0018_0002$$$::"......!"[lr]::
30762::$$$message_0243_0018_0003$$$::There were people that could not be saved, and he himself could not be saved.[lr]::
30763::$$$message_0243_0018_0004$$$::He saw the memories fade away meaninglessly and unjustifiably, and he vowed that he would never let that happen again.::
30764::$$$message_0243_0019_0000$$$::"......!"[lr]::
30765::$$$message_0243_0019_0001$$$::There is only one thing that comes to mind.[lr]::
30766::$$$message_0243_0019_0002$$$::What he believes.[lr]::
30767::$$$message_0243_0019_0003$$$::What he believed.[lr]::
30768::$$$message_0243_0019_0004$$$::An ideal he once swore to never let anyone else have.[lr]::
30769::$$$message_0243_0019_0005$$$::Even now, he swore he would not let anyone take it away from him...::
30770::$$$message_0243_0020_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
30771::$$$message_0243_0020_0001$$$::The man realizes that there is no end to this repeating conflict.::
30772::$$$message_0243_0021_0000$$$::This enemy will not stop.[lr]::
30773::$$$message_0243_0021_0001$$$::The enemy will not stop on his own.[lr]::
30774::$$$message_0243_0021_0002$$$::The boy strikes with all his might, but his efforts do not grab the man's attention.[lr]::
30775::$$$message_0243_0021_0003$$$::The boy is trying to cut down himself...he is the one who is doing the obstructing.[lr]::
30776::$$$message_0243_0021_0004$$$::The enemy is wielding his sword for what he believes in...for the sake of what he can continue to believe in.::
30777::$$$message_0243_0022_0000$$$::"......"[lr]::
30778::$$$message_0243_0022_0001$$$::Realizing that, the man gnashes his teeth.[lr]::
30779::$$$message_0243_0022_0002$$$::He sees the boy keep fighting, even if he knows he can't win...even if he knows there's no point.[lr]::
30780::$$$message_0243_0022_0003$$$::That is the exact mistake the man once made.[lr]::
30781::$$$message_0243_0022_0004$$$::   But then, why?[lr]::
30782::$$$message_0243_0022_0005$$$::Why does he keep looking at that boy straight on?::
30783::$$$message_0243_0023_0000$$$::The high pitched sound of metal.[lr]::
30784::$$$message_0243_0023_0001$$$::The attack finally gets parried.[lr]::
30785::$$$message_0243_0023_0002$$$::The opponent should never have been able to block the attack, but he repels the man's attack with all his might as if it were natural.::
30786::$$$message_0243_0023_0003$$$::   The mirror shatters.[lr]::
30787::$$$message_0243_0023_0004$$$::He's not that strong.[lr]::
30788::$$$message_0243_0023_0005$$$::He's not at all strong.[lr]::
30789::$$$message_0243_0023_0006$$$::The way he looks when he fights is ugly, and it's beyond appalling.[lr]::
30790::$$$message_0243_0023_0007$$$::But that sight...[lr]::
30791::$$$message_0243_0023_0008$$$::Who in this world could laugh and scorn him for that?::
30792::$$$message_0243_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]......[font italic=false][lr]::
30793::$$$message_0243_0024_0001$$$::He holds his breath.[lr]::
30794::$$$message_0243_0024_0002$$$::The enemy flicks his sword and re-sheathes it in a single, large stance.[lr]::
30795::$$$message_0243_0024_0003$$$::This will be the final attack.[lr]::
30796::$$$message_0243_0024_0004$$$::Will he be able to stand any longer with his wounded body and fading spirit?::
30797::$$$message_0243_0025_0000$$$::He will.[lr]::
30798::$$$message_0243_0025_0001$$$::The boy overcame those extreme limits ten times already.[lr]::
30799::$$$message_0243_0025_0002$$$::Then, even if the man prevents this incoming attack, the enemy in front will surely not stop.::
30800::$$$message_0243_0026_0000$$$::"......!"[lr]::
30801::$$$message_0243_0026_0001$$$::He wields his sword as he crumbles to the ground.[lr]::
30802::$$$message_0243_0026_0002$$$::But his eyes...[lr]::
30803::$$$message_0243_0026_0003$$$::They're looking straight at him...::
30804::$$$message_0243_0027_0000$$$::Briefly, he sees a familiar dream.::
30805::$$$message_0243_0028_0000$$$::                This dream...who thought of it, and who passed it down to whom?::
30806::$$$message_0243_0029_0000$$$::"!!!"[lr]::
30807::$$$message_0243_0029_0001$$$::The boy's voice finally reaches his empty heart.[lr]::
30808::$$$message_0243_0029_0002$$$::A single scene comes into sight.::
30809::$$$message_0243_0030_0000$$$::   What an ugly, obsessive false sense of goodwill.[lr]::
30810::$$$message_0243_0030_0001$$$::   A beautiful, struggling ideal.::
30811::$$$message_0243_0031_0000$$$::The final blow comes.[lr]::
30812::$$$message_0243_0031_0001$$$::But the man does not see the sword that is about to pierce his chest.::
30813::$$$message_0243_0032_0000$$$::That is the only thing that motivates the boy.[lr]::
30814::$$$message_0243_0032_0001$$$::Even if his heart is fake, the beauty of what he believes is real.[lr]::
30815::$$$message_0243_0032_0002$$$::   And that's something that can't be faked.[lr]::
30816::$$$message_0243_0032_0003$$$::That was the only thing the man could be proud of...the thing that was once his own strength.::
30817::$$$message_0243_0033_0000$$$::The boy tries to complain with a crushed throat.[lr]::
30818::$$$message_0243_0033_0001$$$::He wants everyone to be happy.[lr]::
30819::$$$message_0243_0033_0002$$$::That's right.[lr]::
30820::$$$message_0243_0033_0003$$$::There was no way to turn back from the very beginning.[lr]::
30821::$$$message_0243_0033_0004$$$::Because this dream is, without a doubt...::
30822::$$$message_0243_0034_0000$$$::Countless sins and mistakes were committed by his hands.[lr]::
30823::$$$message_0243_0034_0001$$$::There was no way to atone for them other than to curse and eliminate himself.[lr]::
30824::$$$message_0243_0034_0002$$$::His blood-soaked hands were proof that he would never be forgiven.[lr]::
30825::$$$message_0243_0034_0003$$$::And yet...::
30826::$$$message_0243_0035_0000$$$::   His gaze is straight.[lr]::
30827::$$$message_0243_0035_0001$$$::   Mistakes and lies...[lr]::
30828::$$$message_0243_0035_0002$$$::   He shakes off everything that pierces him...[lr]::
30829::$$$message_0243_0035_0003$$$::   And he continues to run without stopping.::
30830::$$$message_0243_0036_0000$$$::The battle ends in victory.[lr]::
30831::$$$message_0243_0036_0001$$$::The steel[line2]the pain that pierces his chest will not pardon his sins.[lr]::
30832::$$$message_0243_0036_0002$$$::To a man who curses himself, salvation will never come.::
30833::$$$message_0243_0037_0000$$$::But he gains a small answer.[lr]::
30834::$$$message_0243_0037_0001$$$::The answer will only last until he fades once again. It's a minute and meaningless one that will be forgotten the next time he is summoned.[lr]::
30835::$$$message_0243_0037_0002$$$::There's nothing to feel remorse over.[lr]::
30836::$$$message_0243_0037_0003$$$::It's something that has already been established...something that the boy will spend the rest of his life building.::
30837::$$$message_0243_0038_0000$$$::There is only one thing that comes to mind.[lr]::
30838::$$$message_0243_0038_0001$$$::There is regret.[lr]::
30839::$$$message_0243_0038_0002$$$::He doesn't know how many times he wished to start over.[lr]::
30840::$$$message_0243_0038_0003$$$::This conclusion and ending...Emiya will continue to curse it forever.[lr]::
30841::$$$message_0243_0038_0004$$$::And yet...::
30842::$$$message_0243_0039_0000$$$::                                                 Yet... I was not wrong...::
30843::$$$message_0243_0040_0000$$$::             There's nothing to talk about.[lr]::
30844::$$$message_0243_0040_0001$$$::             The boy will stay, while the man will go.[lr]::
30845::$$$message_0243_0040_0002$$$::             The only thing that remains in memory will be the exchanged blows.::
30846::$$$message_0243_0041_0000$$$::             The path stretches into the distance.[lr]::
30847::$$$message_0243_0041_0001$$$::             Relying on distant echoing sounds, the boy heads for the wilderness.::ýÀ
