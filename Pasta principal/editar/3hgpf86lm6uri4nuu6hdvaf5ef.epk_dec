72742::$$$message_0667_0000_0001$$$::"...her. I killed her. She loved me so much, and I killed...my...sister..."::
72743::$$$message_0667_0001_0000$$$::Sakura isn't talking to me.[lr]::
72744::$$$message_0667_0001_0001$$$::She's in denial.[lr]::
72745::$$$message_0667_0001_0002$$$::She did this.[lr]::
72746::$$$message_0667_0001_0003$$$::In a near-craze, she hates herself with all her heart[line2]herself for soaking in Tohsaka's blood, herself for being corrupted, herself for connecting to the Shadow.::
72747::$$$message_0667_0002_0000$$$::"I was a fool. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was just so painful. She told me not to, always told me not to lose, but I didn't understand because I'm stupid, and Senpai believed in me, but I keep betraying[line2]"::
72748::$$$message_0667_0003_0000$$$::The shadow binds Sakura.[lr]::
72749::$$$message_0667_0003_0001$$$::The black Command Spells covering her whole body chain her in place.::
72750::$$$message_0667_0004_0000$$$::"No more... I have to stop this...but I can't...take it back...No more... I don't want to do this anymore!"::
72751::$$$message_0667_0005_0000$$$::   She refuses.[lr]::
72752::$$$message_0667_0005_0001$$$::Sakura is rejecting the Shadow.[lr]::
72753::$$$message_0667_0005_0002$$$::She's trying to reject the Shadow and kill herself in her self-hatred.::
72754::$$$message_0667_0006_0000$$$::But she can't.[lr]::
72755::$$$message_0667_0006_0001$$$::The Shadow needs her body.[lr]::
72756::$$$message_0667_0006_0002$$$::She's trying to kill herself, but the Shadow won't allow it.[lr]::
72757::$$$message_0667_0006_0003$$$::Sakura's self-condemnation and the Shadow's attempt to stop her from killing herself are tearing her apart.::
72758::$$$message_0667_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72759::$$$message_0667_0007_0001$$$::...Tohsaka won.[lr]::
72760::$$$message_0667_0007_0002$$$::Sakura's breaking free of her possession.[lr]::
72761::$$$message_0667_0007_0003$$$::I knew it. She chose Sakura's life in the very end.::
72762::$$$message_0667_0008_0000$$$::Sakura is Sakura.[lr]::
72763::$$$message_0667_0008_0001$$$::Even if the Shadow swallows her, she hasn't changed at her core.[lr]::
72764::$$$message_0667_0008_0002$$$::...I'm the one who did this to her.[lr]::
72765::$$$message_0667_0008_0003$$$::Back then... If I hadn't been afraid of the shadow-touched Sakura and slapped some sense into her, this never would've happened.::
72766::$$$message_0667_0009_0000$$$::"......Ngh."[lr]::
72767::$$$message_0667_0009_0001$$$::I run to Tohsaka.[lr]::
72768::$$$message_0667_0009_0002$$$::She's still breathing, just barely.[lr]::
72769::$$$message_0667_0009_0003$$$::    It's still too early to give up.::
72770::$$$message_0667_0010_0000$$$::"Sakura. Tohsaka isn't dead."[lr]::
72771::$$$message_0667_0010_0001$$$::".........?"::
72772::$$$message_0667_0011_0000$$$::"That's right. She isn't dead. We can still save her. No, we [font italic=true]will[font italic=false] save her. You and I need to save her. Isn't that right, Sakura?"::
72773::$$$message_0667_0012_0000$$$::"Ah... Eh?"[lr]::
72774::$$$message_0667_0012_0001$$$::Light returns to Sakura's eyes.[lr]::
72775::$$$message_0667_0012_0002$$$::   The Shadow's hold weakens.::
72776::$$$message_0667_0013_0000$$$::Finally, she recognizes me and Tohsaka, sighs in relief, and...[lr]::
72777::$$$message_0667_0013_0001$$$::"...! No! You have to run, Senpai!"[lr]::
72778::$$$message_0667_0013_0002$$$::...desperately holds herself back.::
72779::$$$message_0667_0014_0000$$$::"...Ngh!"[lr]::
72780::$$$message_0667_0014_0001$$$::I shield Tohsaka with my body and take the Shadow's attack on my back.[lr]::
72781::$$$message_0667_0014_0002$$$::"Ah... N-no, that wasn't me, I...!"::
72782::$$$message_0667_0015_0000$$$::Shadows spill out one after another from behind Sakura.[lr]::
72783::$$$message_0667_0015_0001$$$::...You've gotta be kidding me.[lr]::
72784::$$$message_0667_0015_0002$$$::It's not even born yet, but its sense of danger is first-class.::
72785::$$$message_0667_0016_0000$$$::"I know. It's that sore loser behind you. It doesn't want me to take you, so it's throwing a tantrum.[lr]::
72786::$$$message_0667_0016_0001$$$::...Just hang on. I'll give it a good punch and take it away from you."[lr]::
72787::$$$message_0667_0016_0002$$$::I walk toward Sakura.::
72788::$$$message_0667_0017_0000$$$::"No... S-stop, Senpai!"[lr]::
72789::$$$message_0667_0017_0001$$$::A shadow grazes my cheek.[lr]::
72790::$$$message_0667_0017_0002$$$::It would have taken my head off, but Sakura's shout seems to have changed its trajectory.::
72791::$$$message_0667_0018_0000$$$::"Hah...ah, ah, ugh...!"[lr]::
72792::$$$message_0667_0018_0001$$$::Sakura hugs herself like she's trying to hold something in.[lr]::
72793::$$$message_0667_0018_0002$$$::But the shadows don't disappear. They keep increasing in number.::
72794::$$$message_0667_0019_0000$$$::"Uu...uu...uuu...!"[lr]::
72795::$$$message_0667_0019_0001$$$::...She's crying.[lr]::
72796::$$$message_0667_0019_0002$$$::Sakura is sobbing.[lr]::
72797::$$$message_0667_0019_0003$$$::Not because the shadows are eating at her and causing pain.[lr]::
72798::$$$message_0667_0019_0004$$$::She's crying in frustration that she can't keep the shadows under control.::
72799::$$$message_0667_0020_0000$$$::"...Senpai, no. I can't...hold them back. Nee-san warned me, but I lost to them... I wasn't strong at all. I'm a crybaby, a coward, and a horrible person."[lr]::
72800::$$$message_0667_0020_0001$$$::I take another step forward.[lr]::
72801::$$$message_0667_0020_0002$$$::A shadowy spear grazes my cheek again.::
72802::$$$message_0667_0021_0000$$$::"...! Stop! Why are you coming this way!?[lr]::
72803::$$$message_0667_0021_0001$$$::I'll kill you if you get any closer...!"[lr]::
72804::$$$message_0667_0021_0002$$$::I take another step.[lr]::
72805::$$$message_0667_0021_0003$$$::I place my right hand on my left shoulder.::
72806::$$$message_0667_0022_0000$$$::"Why? Run. Please run away, Senpai! Take Nee-san and get out of here![lr]::
72807::$$$message_0667_0022_0001$$$::You can forget about me...! I'll... I'll make sure I die here! I'll make sure I die all alone! I... I don't want... I don't want you to see me like this, Senpai...!"::
72808::$$$message_0667_0023_0000$$$::    The Shadow binds her more strongly with each step I take.[lr]::
72809::$$$message_0667_0023_0001$$$::My advance is hurting Sakura's body and heart.::
72810::$$$message_0667_0024_0000$$$::"Why won't you do what I ask you to!?[lr]::
72811::$$$message_0667_0024_0001$$$::I-if you come any closer, I won't be able to hold it back. I'll kill you before you can kill me...!"[lr]::
72812::$$$message_0667_0024_0002$$$::"That won't happen at all. I'm going to get you out of here and save Tohsaka. I already told you that, Sakura."::
72813::$$$message_0667_0025_0000$$$::"...Are you still saying that, Senpai?[lr]::
72814::$$$message_0667_0025_0001$$$::...Please stop. I'm beyond saving. No, I shouldn't be saved. I don't deserve to live."::
72815::$$$message_0667_0026_0000$$$::One step.[lr]::
72816::$$$message_0667_0026_0001$$$::"Ngh."[lr]::
72817::$$$message_0667_0026_0002$$$::A shadow hits me squarely in the stomach.[lr]::
72818::$$$message_0667_0026_0003$$$::...It isn't a stab. It was just a dull punch.[lr]::
72819::$$$message_0667_0026_0004$$$::Sakura did it out of her own will, to push me away.::
72820::$$$message_0667_0027_0000$$$::"Did you see that, Senpai? This is who I am now. I can't leave this place anymore, and this child won't let me go.[lr]::
72821::$$$message_0667_0027_0001$$$::And...even if I did..."::
72822::$$$message_0667_0028_0000$$$::"...I've killed a lot of people. So many people. I even killed my brother and grandfather, and my sister...![lr]::
72823::$$$message_0667_0028_0001$$$::What's someone like me supposed to do now!? I can't give back what I've taken from them. I've killed too many people. Are you still going to tell me to live despite all that, Senpai!?"::
72824::$$$message_0667_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72825::$$$message_0667_0029_0001$$$::...I see now.[lr]::
72826::$$$message_0667_0029_0002$$$::She's on a path of no return.[lr]::
72827::$$$message_0667_0029_0003$$$::Sakura feels like she's trapped by sins that she can't atone for.::
72828::$$$message_0667_0030_0000$$$::She thinks that there's no salvation.[lr]::
72829::$$$message_0667_0030_0001$$$::No matter what, she'll never forget the sin of taking so many lives, even if it wasn't of her own free will.[lr]::
72830::$$$message_0667_0030_0002$$$::Even if she's freed from the Shadow and goes back to normal, a different kind of shadow will always hang over her.[lr]::
72831::$$$message_0667_0030_0003$$$::And yet...::
72832::$$$message_0667_0031_0000$$$::"...Of course I am. You need to take responsibility for what you've done, Sakura."::
72833::$$$message_0667_0032_0000$$$::I release the bindings on my left arm.[lr]::
72834::$$$message_0667_0032_0001$$$::This is the last time. I completely unravel the red shroud that's been holding back death's door.::
72835::$$$message_0667_0033_0000$$$::...I lose consciousness.[lr]::
72836::$$$message_0667_0033_0001$$$::Before I'm gone, I need to go forward.[lr]::
72837::$$$message_0667_0033_0002$$$::I need to say what I came to say to Sakura while my mouth still works.::
72838::$$$message_0667_0034_0000$$$::"Sen...pai."[lr]::
72839::$$$message_0667_0034_0001$$$::"Yeah. I don't know who's responsible or how heavy the punishment should be."[lr]::
72840::$$$message_0667_0034_0002$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
72841::$$$message_0667_0034_0003$$$::Shadows strike at my shoulder, chest, left leg, and stomach.[lr]::
72842::$$$message_0667_0034_0004$$$::[font italic=true]Grinnnnd.[font italic=false][lr]::
72843::$$$message_0667_0034_0005$$$::They get deflected and fail to pierce me, throwing up a shower of sparks.::
72844::$$$message_0667_0035_0000$$$::"But I'll protect you. I'll protect you from everything people blame you for.[lr]::
72845::$$$message_0667_0035_0001$$$::Even if it's hypocritical, I've always tried to live up to the ideal of protecting the people I love."[lr]::
72846::$$$message_0667_0035_0002$$$::Forward.[lr]::
72847::$$$message_0667_0035_0003$$$::Sakura's right in front of me now.::
72848::$$$message_0667_0036_0000$$$::"Oh no... Senpai, your body..."[lr]::
72849::$$$message_0667_0036_0001$$$::...Begin...Projection.[lr]::
72850::$$$message_0667_0036_0002$$$::Only one item comes to mind.[lr]::
72851::$$$message_0667_0036_0003$$$::Shirou Emiya devotes all of his remaining magical energy into its replication.::
72852::$$$message_0667_0037_0000$$$::My final Projection.[lr]::
72853::$$$message_0667_0037_0001$$$::I raise a dagger of contract-breaking.[lr]::
72854::$$$message_0667_0037_0002$$$::I can't see Sakura's face very well.::
72855::$$$message_0667_0038_0000$$$::"Sen...pai."[lr]::
72856::$$$message_0667_0038_0001$$$::"This is your punishment. It's gonna hurt, so grit your teeth and bear it."[lr]::
72857::$$$message_0667_0038_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
72858::$$$message_0667_0038_0003$$$::I hear her suck in her breath.[lr]::
72859::$$$message_0667_0038_0004$$$::And then...[lr]::
72860::$$$message_0667_0038_0005$$$::Sakura says, "yes," and exposes her chest.::
72861::$$$message_0667_0039_0000$$$::                            Like this is going to be her final punishment.::
72862::$$$message_0667_0040_0000$$$::                     "Let's go home, Sakura. Cut your ties with that guy."::
72863::$$$message_0667_0041_0000$$$::                                    In a breath, I stab her in the heart.::
