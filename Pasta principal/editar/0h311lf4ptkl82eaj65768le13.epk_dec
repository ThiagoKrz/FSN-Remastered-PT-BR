42510::$$$message_0372_0000_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
42511::$$$message_0372_0000_0001$$$::I open my eyes.[lr]::
42512::$$$message_0372_0000_0002$$$::My eyes are not the only thing that wake up, as my sleeping mind wakes up as well.::
42513::$$$message_0372_0001_0000$$$::"The wound is... Not a problem."[lr]::
42514::$$$message_0372_0001_0001$$$::I check the wound on my left shoulder.[lr]::
42515::$$$message_0372_0001_0002$$$::It still hurts, but there's no intense pain like last night.[lr]::
42516::$$$message_0372_0001_0003$$$::The heat in my body has gone down as well.[lr]::
42517::$$$message_0372_0001_0004$$$::It shouldn't be a problem for me to move around.::
42518::$$$message_0372_0002_0000$$$::I eat breakfast and fill my empty stomach.[lr]::
42519::$$$message_0372_0002_0001$$$::Food comes before anything. My body won't move how I want it to unless it gets the nutrition it needs.::
42520::$$$message_0372_0003_0000$$$::"...All right."[lr]::
42521::$$$message_0372_0003_0001$$$::I reapply the bandage on my left shoulder.[lr]::
42522::$$$message_0372_0003_0002$$$::My exposed skin and wound have turned dark blue.[lr]::
42523::$$$message_0372_0003_0003$$$::My wound hasn't healed up, and I can see dark red skin peeking through.::
42524::$$$message_0372_0004_0000$$$::"...Of course. Saber's not here right now."[lr]::
42525::$$$message_0372_0004_0001$$$::I disinfect for my peace of mind, put gauze over it, and wrap bandages around it.[lr]::
42526::$$$message_0372_0004_0002$$$::Wrapping bandages and constricting the wound is the most primitive first-aid treatment, but I have to do this or my wound would expand just by moving my left arm.[lr]::
42527::$$$message_0372_0004_0003$$$::"All done. I just need a weapon now."::
42528::$$$message_0372_0005_0000$$$::The sky is cloudy.[lr]::
42529::$$$message_0372_0005_0001$$$::It must be really cold today, as there's still frost left in the yard.::
42530::$$$message_0372_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42531::$$$message_0372_0006_0001$$$::But, this has nothing to do with me. [lr]::
42532::$$$message_0372_0006_0002$$$::I don't feel any cold.[lr]::
42533::$$$message_0372_0006_0003$$$::My body is so hot I want to pour ice water over my head.[lr]::
42534::$$$message_0372_0006_0004$$$::Even then, my body is in much better condition compared to yesterday.::
42535::$$$message_0372_0007_0000$$$::These bamboo swords are the only things that I could use as weapons after all.[lr]::
42536::$$$message_0372_0007_0001$$$::I choose the one that seems like it could pass magical energy through it the best and wrap it in my bag.::
42537::$$$message_0372_0008_0000$$$::Then, I slap my cheeks.[lr]::
42538::$$$message_0372_0008_0001$$$::I don't know if it was to psyche myself up again or if I was preparing to never come back here.[lr]::
42539::$$$message_0372_0008_0002$$$::I don't know why I did it myself.::
42540::$$$message_0372_0009_0000$$$::I sling the bag over my right shoulder and head outside.[lr]::
42541::$$$message_0372_0009_0001$$$::The place where I've spent many years.[lr]::
42542::$$$message_0372_0009_0002$$$::I didn't even look back at the shed that could be considered my own room.::
42543::$$$message_0372_0010_0000$$$::    Well...[lr]::
42544::$$$message_0372_0010_0001$$$::Even though I decided to fight, there are still plenty of problems.[lr]::
42545::$$$message_0372_0010_0002$$$::I have to make clear what I need to prioritize and what I need to do, or else it'll end without me being able to do anything. [lr]::
42546::$$$message_0372_0010_0003$$$::There are two paths to take.[lr]::
42547::$$$message_0372_0010_0004$$$::I...[lr]::
