34724::$$$message_0281_0000_0000$$$::Hi, is everyone doing well? This is the 19th Tiger Dojo, where we save Shirou who has died a disappointing death after letting his guard down for just a moment!::
34725::$$$message_0281_0000_0001$$$::We have a special guest this time: The barbaric flying head, RIN.[lr]::
34726::$$$message_0281_0000_0002$$$::RIN, how are you feeling?::
34727::$$$message_0281_0000_0003$$$::KILL Shirou.::
34728::$$$message_0281_0000_0004$$$::(How wonderful!)::
34729::$$$message_0281_0000_0005$$$::Oh, I know how you feel, but please restrain yourself.::
34730::$$$message_0281_0000_0006$$$::In short, Shirou's action of prioritizing Saber over RIN was professional negligence resulting in death.::
34731::$$$message_0281_0000_0007$$$::But can you blame him?[lr]::
34732::$$$message_0281_0000_0008$$$::You didn't have enough charm as a woman compared to Saber, so you weren't protected when it mattered most!::
34733::$$$message_0281_0000_0009$$$::Well you just weren't lucky during battle, so devote yourself to being a cute girl so this doesn't happen next time!::
34734::$$$message_0281_0000_0010$$$::...::
34735::$$$message_0281_0000_0011$$$::But Shirou should reflect on his actions too![lr]::
34736::$$$message_0281_0000_0012$$$::In that situation, you should prioritize Tohsaka over Saber.::
34737::$$$message_0281_0000_0013$$$::I know it hurts to abandon Saber, but you should harden your heart and protect Tohsaka even if it's JUST Tohsaka.::
34738::$$$message_0281_0000_0014$$$::Agh...!? T-t-t-the neck moved!?[lr]::
34739::$$$message_0281_0000_0015$$$::R-RIN, excuse me for asking, but where are you going...?::
34740::$$$message_0281_0000_0016$$$::To go kill Shirou.::
34741::$$$message_0281_0000_0017$$$::Ahhh...!!![lr]::
34742::$$$message_0281_0000_0018$$$::RUN, GRANDPA, RUN!::
34743::$$$message_0281_0000_0019$$$::(She really is wonderful...!)::
