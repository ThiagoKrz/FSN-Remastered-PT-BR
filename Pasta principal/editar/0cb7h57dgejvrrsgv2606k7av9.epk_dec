17455::$$$message_0161_0000_0000$$$::Now that I think about it, there's one thing that I don't understand.[lr]::
17456::$$$message_0161_0000_0001$$$::Why wasn't Tohsaka just crushed during our battle with Berserker?[lr]::
17457::$$$message_0161_0000_0002$$$::What sort of trickery did she use?::
17458::$$$message_0161_0001_0000$$$::"Hey Tohsaka. Can I ask you about something that happened yesterday?"[lr]::
17459::$$$message_0161_0001_0001$$$::"What is it? Make it quick. I'm busy."::
17460::$$$message_0161_0002_0000$$$::"Okay. So Berserker grabbed you. I'm just wondering how you survived. You don't look like it, but do you work your abs or something?"[lr]::
17461::$$$message_0161_0002_0001$$$::"Ahahaha. If ripped abs were all I needed to survive Berserker's grip, my stomach would be harder than steel."::
17462::$$$message_0161_0003_0000$$$::"Sorry, that was the wrong way to ask.[lr]::
17463::$$$message_0161_0003_0001$$$::I apologize, so please stop grinning at me like that."[lr]::
17464::$$$message_0161_0003_0002$$$::"Then stop provoking me."::
17465::$$$message_0161_0004_0000$$$::"As to how I survived... I placed a jewel on my stomach before the fight. I snuck it into my clothes to create a protective barrier around me. Got it?"::
17466::$$$message_0161_0005_0000$$$::"I see. So you expected Berserker to grab you from the get-go. Makes sense then, planning to protect yourself.[lr]::
17467::$$$message_0161_0005_0001$$$::But that means your jewels..."::
17468::$$$message_0161_0006_0000$$$::"I'm all tapped out. I used one for Saber, three to distract Berserker, five to blow his face off, and one to protect myself.[lr]::
17469::$$$message_0161_0006_0001$$$::Ten years I spent, saving those up, and they went in an instant. Even after using most of them, I still couldn't defeat Berserker."::
17470::$$$message_0161_0007_0000$$$::In spite of her dejected sigh, Tohsaka doesn't seem to regret what happened.[lr]::
17471::$$$message_0161_0007_0001$$$::What's done is done.[lr]::
17472::$$$message_0161_0007_0002$$$::She knows very well not to dwell on what she lost, but to focus on what she gained in exchange.::
17473::$$$message_0161_0008_0000$$$::"I see. Sorry about that, Tohsaka."[lr]::
17474::$$$message_0161_0008_0001$$$::"Thanks. But I'm going to learn from this, and make gems that'll let me defeat an enemy like that all on my own."::
17475::$$$message_0161_0009_0000$$$::She's as blunt as ever about that.[lr]::
17476::$$$message_0161_0009_0001$$$::But I'm also sure she'll manage it.[lr]::
17477::$$$message_0161_0009_0002$$$::...And then I realize.[lr]::
17478::$$$message_0161_0009_0003$$$::Tohsaka is the reason we won against Berserker.::
