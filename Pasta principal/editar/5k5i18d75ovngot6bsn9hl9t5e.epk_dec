46372::$$$message_0410_0000_0000$$$::The sky is still gray.[lr]::
46373::$$$message_0410_0000_0001$$$::We leave the now deserted church.::
46374::$$$message_0410_0001_0000$$$::"Oh. So you're done with your business, boy?"[lr]::
46375::$$$message_0410_0001_0001$$$::...There.[lr]::
46376::$$$message_0410_0001_0002$$$::In the clearing in front of us is the familiar spearman.::
46377::$$$message_0410_0002_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
46378::$$$message_0410_0002_0001$$$::Saber glares at him while supporting me.[lr]::
46379::$$$message_0410_0002_0002$$$::She's so tense that she would slash him without hesitation if he took another step.::
46380::$$$message_0410_0003_0000$$$::"...No, you're mistaken, Saber. He helped us."[lr]::
46381::$$$message_0410_0003_0001$$$::"Huh...? Do you mean Lancer cooperated with you, Shirou?"::
46382::$$$message_0410_0004_0000$$$::"...Yeah, that's right. If you can, don't fight him, please."[lr]::
46383::$$$message_0410_0004_0001$$$::Saber stares at Lancer in astonishment.[lr]::
46384::$$$message_0410_0004_0002$$$::...It seems like he's fully enjoying Saber's reaction.::
46385::$$$message_0410_0005_0000$$$::"I understand, but... Why, Lancer? Is cooperating with Shirou and Rin part of some scheme?"::
46386::$$$message_0410_0006_0000$$$::"Huh? Oh, are you stupid? Of course I am. I won't help someone unless I'm scheming something secretly."::
46387::$$$message_0410_0007_0000$$$::"...Ha."[lr]::
46388::$$$message_0410_0007_0001$$$::I knew he was that kind of guy, but he's thorough as he's making fun of Saber as well.::
46389::$$$message_0410_0008_0000$$$::"Mrgh. What is so funny, Shirou?"[lr]::
46390::$$$message_0410_0008_0001$$$::"Huh... Was I laughing...?"::
46391::$$$message_0410_0009_0000$$$::"Yes, you were. I suppose I was mistaken. It seems as though I do not need to support you if you are well enough to laugh."[lr]::
46392::$$$message_0410_0009_0001$$$::...It's bad, but that made me a bit relieved.::
46393::$$$message_0410_0010_0000$$$::Saber is the same as before.[lr]::
46394::$$$message_0410_0010_0001$$$::Our connection is gone, but she's here just like before.[lr]::
46395::$$$message_0410_0010_0002$$$::Then...what's there to regret?::
46396::$$$message_0410_0011_0000$$$::"...My bad, I guess I let my guard down. Now's not the time, huh?"::
46397::$$$message_0410_0012_0000$$$::"...Yes. We should rest for now, even if we are to get Rin back... Lancer, I do not know what your objective is, but you should be done with your business. Then leave. I will not fight you now."[lr]::
46398::$$$message_0410_0012_0001$$$::She declares in a dignified manner and goes down to the clearing.::
46399::$$$message_0410_0013_0000$$$::"...Huh? Hey, everything went well...or I guess not. What happened, boy?"[lr]::
46400::$$$message_0410_0013_0001$$$::"Archer took Tohsaka away. We're just going to get her back."[lr]::
46401::$$$message_0410_0013_0002$$$::I bear my dizziness and answer looking into Lancer's eyes.::
46402::$$$message_0410_0014_0000$$$::"...What? Hold on, what's going on?"[lr]::
46403::$$$message_0410_0014_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46404::$$$message_0410_0014_0002$$$::...I'm sorry, but I don't have any energy left.[lr]::
46405::$$$message_0410_0014_0003$$$::I can't give such a long explanation, so I should go home and...::
46406::$$$message_0410_0015_0000$$$::"Archer's objective is to kill Shirou. In order to do that, he has abducted my Master, Rin, and requested a duel with Shirou in exchange.[lr]::
46407::$$$message_0410_0015_0001$$$::Her safety will not be guaranteed if we do not go to him within a day."::
46408::$$$message_0410_0016_0000$$$::...Well.[lr]::
46409::$$$message_0410_0016_0001$$$::It was helpful of you to explain on my behalf, but there's no point in telling Lancer that, Saber.::
46410::$$$message_0410_0017_0000$$$::"...Damn, he really did it this time."[lr]::
46411::$$$message_0410_0017_0001$$$::...Then.[lr]::
46412::$$$message_0410_0017_0002$$$::He takes off his friendly face and grits his teeth.::
46413::$$$message_0410_0018_0000$$$::"...Lancer?"[lr]::
46414::$$$message_0410_0018_0001$$$::"So, what? He betrayed his young lady not once, but twice?"[lr]::
46415::$$$message_0410_0018_0002$$$::"Uh.... Yes, that would be the case. What about it...?"::
46416::$$$message_0410_0019_0000$$$::"...Don't 'what about it' me...damn it, I changed my mind.[lr]::
46417::$$$message_0410_0019_0001$$$::This was the only help I was going to offer, but let me help you a little longer. I won't be able to have peace of mind like this."[lr]::
46418::$$$message_0410_0019_0002$$$::Lancer spits out and starts walking.::
46419::$$$message_0410_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46420::$$$message_0410_0020_0001$$$::Saber stares at Lancer silently.[lr]::
46421::$$$message_0410_0020_0002$$$::...I understand how she feels.[lr]::
46422::$$$message_0410_0020_0003$$$::Lancer's back looked as if he was telling us that he'll join us.::
46423::$$$message_0410_0021_0000$$$::"...I am troubled. What kind of magecraft did you and Rin use to get him on our side?"::
46424::$$$message_0410_0022_0000$$$::Saber's voice sounds more shocked than amazed.[lr]::
46425::$$$message_0410_0022_0001$$$::But unfortunately, I don't have the energy to answer, and my wounds are starting to hurt again.::
46426::$$$message_0410_0022_0002$$$::...No, first of all...[lr]::
46427::$$$message_0410_0022_0003$$$::I'm the one who wants to ask that question.::
