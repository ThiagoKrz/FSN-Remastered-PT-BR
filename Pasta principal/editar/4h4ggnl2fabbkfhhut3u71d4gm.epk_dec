40043::$$$message_0343_0000_0002$$$::Saber is following behind me.::
40044::$$$message_0343_0001_0000$$$::"You're late. You have some nerve making a girl wait."[lr]::
40045::$$$message_0343_0001_0001$$$::I don't have any nerve.[lr]::
40046::$$$message_0343_0001_0002$$$::It seems it's already been decided that we're going on a date without my consultation.::
40047::$$$message_0343_0002_0000$$$::"Wait, hold on...! Why are we going out!?"[lr]::
40048::$$$message_0343_0002_0001$$$::Because I feel like it. You don't mind right? It's not like we're doing anything during the day. I won't let you run away now.::
40049::$$$message_0343_0003_0000$$$::"Er... Well, I don't mind, but... Yeah, what about Archer!? He must be against something like this!"::
40050::$$$message_0343_0004_0000$$$::"I left Archer. I bet he's sleeping at my house right now."::

40052::$$$message_0343_0005_0001$$$::...I can't win.[lr]::
40053::$$$message_0343_0005_0002$$$::I can't talk down Tohsaka on my own.[lr]::
40054::$$$message_0343_0005_0003$$$::If anyone can stop her, um...::
40055::$$$message_0343_0006_0000$$$::"That's right, Saber! What about Saber?"[lr]::
40056::$$$message_0343_0006_0001$$$::"Saber is fine, she can accompany us." [lr]::
40057::$$$message_0343_0006_0002$$$::Defeated.[lr]::
40058::$$$message_0343_0006_0003$$$::All my cards are trumped with just one sentence.::
40059::$$$message_0343_0007_0000$$$::"Have you accepted it now? Then let's hurry. We're going to forget our duties as Masters and have fun."[lr]::
40060::$$$message_0343_0007_0001$$$::"Huh... Hey, wait I said, idiot...!"[lr]::
40061::$$$message_0343_0007_0002$$$::There's no time to be confused.[lr]::

40064::$$$message_0343_0008_0001$$$::...It seems like I have no choice but to give up.[lr]::
40065::$$$message_0343_0008_0002$$$::Tohsaka seems so energetic that I don't think I can compete with her, and I know she'll just argue me down even if I protest. And I don't know why, but Saber is following us without a complaint.[lr]::
40066::$$$message_0343_0008_0003$$$::...And well, besides...[lr]::
40067::$$$message_0343_0008_0004$$$::See. It's a really nice day out today.:dø
