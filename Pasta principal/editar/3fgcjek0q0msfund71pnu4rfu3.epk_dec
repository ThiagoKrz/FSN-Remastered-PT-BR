2739::$$$message_0024_0000_0000$$$::...Before she became a Servant.[lr]::
2740::$$$message_0024_0000_0001$$$::I wonder what Saber was like when she was alive.::
2741::$$$message_0024_0001_0000$$$::Saber is so beautiful, so I'm sure everyone must have liked her.[lr]::
2742::$$$message_0024_0001_0001$$$::Calling her Saber is what's throwing me off, but I bet she was an ordinary girl who never held a sword back in the day.::
2743::$$$message_0024_0002_0000$$$::"So...Saber. What were you like before?"[lr]::
2744::$$$message_0024_0002_0001$$$::I'm so curious, I just blurt out what's on my mind without thinking...or even realizing I'm doing it.::
2745::$$$message_0024_0003_0000$$$::"Come again? Did you say something, Shirou?"[lr]::
2746::$$$message_0024_0003_0001$$$::"Eh? It's nothing. I was just imagining what you were like. I'm not trying to find out your True Name or anything, but I just wanted to know what your life was like."::
2747::$$$message_0024_0004_0000$$$::"What kind of person I was...?[lr]::
2748::$$$message_0024_0004_0001$$$::You are interested in the strangest things, Shirou."::
2749::$$$message_0024_0005_0000$$$::"You can just ignore the question if you don't want to answer. It just kind of popped into my head.[lr]::
2750::$$$message_0024_0005_0001$$$::I know you're Saber, a Servant, but I just thought you must have been a completely different person before you became a Servant."::
2751::$$$message_0024_0006_0000$$$::...That's right.[lr]::
2752::$$$message_0024_0006_0001$$$::I imagine she lived a peaceful life, as befits a lovely girl like her.::
2753::$$$message_0024_0007_0000$$$::"...I do not think that is true.[lr]::
2754::$$$message_0024_0007_0001$$$::One's personality does not change just because they become a Servant. I was a knight who was handed a sword the moment I was born. There was never any other me...as you might have imagined."::
2755::$$$message_0024_0008_0000$$$::"Seriously? Then you've always been so harsh?[lr]::
2756::$$$message_0024_0008_0001$$$::That's no good. I kinda sympathize with the people who were around you."::
2757::$$$message_0024_0009_0000$$$::"What do you mean by that?[lr]::
2758::$$$message_0024_0009_0001$$$::I may be stern, but I do not recall being harsh to those around me."::
2759::$$$message_0024_0010_0000$$$::"That can't be true. Today's training taught me you're merciless.[lr]::
2760::$$$message_0024_0010_0001$$$::Look at this welt. I make one tiny mistake, and you happily drive in at every opportunity, you demon."::
2761::$$$message_0024_0011_0000$$$::"I-I did not do it happily![lr]::
2762::$$$message_0024_0011_0001$$$::I-it may be tough on you, but it would not be training if I were not strict!"::
2763::$$$message_0024_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2764::$$$message_0024_0012_0001$$$::This is strange.[lr]::
2765::$$$message_0024_0012_0002$$$::I somehow never expected Saber to make a face like that.::
2766::$$$message_0024_0013_0000$$$::"Wh-what is that look? I believe it is unfair for you to suddenly fall silent."::
2767::$$$message_0024_0014_0000$$$::"Oh, uh...I never thought you would get mad like that, so you just kind of surprised me."::
2768::$$$message_0024_0015_0000$$$::"I-is that so? I thought I was only asserting my point."[lr]::
2769::$$$message_0024_0015_0001$$$::"Yeah, but you're not usually so emotional, so that was new to me."::
2770::$$$message_0024_0016_0000$$$::"D-do you really think so? I was simply expressing what I believe."[lr]::
2771::$$$message_0024_0016_0001$$$::"But those aren't your feelings, they're your beliefs.[lr]::
2772::$$$message_0024_0016_0002$$$::That's not what I'm talking about. I'm saying that you never speak straight from the heart."::
2773::$$$message_0024_0017_0000$$$::"Of course not. What is required from me is not my own personal opinion, but rather my opinion based on my standing and position. That is true even now.[lr]::
2774::$$$message_0024_0017_0001$$$::I am a Servant, a Saber, and I will protect Shirou.[lr]::
2775::$$$message_0024_0017_0002$$$::There is no point in my saying anything unconnected with my purpose.[lr]::
2776::$$$message_0024_0017_0003$$$::And there is no sense in me thinking otherwise."::
2777::$$$message_0024_0018_0000$$$::"That may be true, but that would be boring for you.[lr]::
2778::$$$message_0024_0018_0001$$$::You might have a role to fill, but that doesn't mean you have to devote yourself to that and nothing else. There are things you [font italic=true]want[font italic=false] to do too, right?"::
2779::$$$message_0024_0019_0000$$$::"As I said, my job is to protect you. You are inexperienced as a Master to begin with, and so I am attempting to train you because you stubbornly insist you wish to fight in spite of my warnings!"::
2780::$$$message_0024_0020_0000$$$::"Uh, that may not be entirely true, but...well, if you say so, then I guess it's okay."[lr]::
2781::$$$message_0024_0020_0001$$$::I feel like this conversation has softened Saber up a bit. She even looks more cheerful now. So as not to ruin the moment, I decide not to press the matter.::
