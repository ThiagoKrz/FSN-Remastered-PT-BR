10781::$$$message_0109_0001_0001$$$::My heart feels like it's burning.[lr]::
10782::$$$message_0109_0001_0002$$$::Actually, it feels more heat from outside has been forced into my body.::
10783::$$$message_0109_0002_0000$$$::"...From outside!?"[lr]::
10784::$$$message_0109_0002_0001$$$::I doubt myself briefly.[lr]::
10785::$$$message_0109_0002_0002$$$::But before I can think of what it might be, I find myself rushing outside.::
10786::$$$message_0109_0003_0000$$$::"Saber, are you here!?"[lr]::
10787::$$$message_0109_0003_0001$$$::I open the sliding screen door to Saber's room.::

10790::$$$message_0109_0004_0002$$$::If she's not here, she...went to Ryudou Temple on her own!::
10791::$$$message_0109_0005_0000$$$::"That idiot! Why!? She hasn't healed, so why would she...!?"::
10792::$$$message_0109_0006_0000$$$::I'm so angry my head is starting to hurt.[lr]::
10793::$$$message_0109_0006_0001$$$::I didn't tell her I wasn't going to fight.[lr]::
10794::$$$message_0109_0006_0002$$$::I just...[lr]::
10795::$$$message_0109_0006_0003$$$::I just didn't want her to get hurt like that again!::
10796::$$$message_0109_0007_0000$$$::"Gngh...!"[lr]::
10797::$$$message_0109_0007_0001$$$::There's no point in fuming here.[lr]::
10798::$$$message_0109_0007_0002$$$::I need to hurry to Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
10799::$$$message_0109_0007_0003$$$::I can't let Saber fight alone.[lr]::
10800::$$$message_0109_0007_0004$$$::Well I don't know what good I can do her, but if I get there, maybe I can do [font italic=true]something[font italic=false]!::

10802::$$$message_0109_0008_0001$$$::I run.[lr]::
10803::$$$message_0109_0008_0002$$$::I don't even take the time to change. Out front, I grab a bike and pedal as fast as I can.::
10804::$$$message_0109_0009_0000$$$::I pedal down the hill without braking.[lr]::
10805::$$$message_0109_0009_0001$$$::    It'll take at least forty minutes to Ryudou Temple, even if I rush.[lr]::
10806::$$$message_0109_0009_0002$$$::I don't know how long it's been since Saber left, but I need to get to her as fast as I can!::
