3813::$$$message_0040_0000_0000$$$::We finish eating lunch, then continue our training in the afternoon.[lr]::
3814::$$$message_0040_0000_0001$$$::I keep crossing blades with Saber, never getting tired of it.[lr]::
3815::$$$message_0040_0000_0002$$$::We keep training, and only plan to stop when Tohsaka and Fuji-nee come home.[lr]::
3816::$$$message_0040_0000_0003$$$::But our training is interrupted by the sound of the doorbell.::
3817::$$$message_0040_0001_0000$$$::"Shirou. It appears you have a visitor."[lr]::
3818::$$$message_0040_0001_0001$$$::"Yeah, I heard it. I'm going to go get the door, so you stay here, Saber."[lr]::
3819::$$$message_0040_0001_0002$$$::"No. It could potentially be an unwanted visitor, so I will accompany you, just in case."[lr]::
3820::$$$message_0040_0001_0003$$$::"...Hm."[lr]::
3821::$$$message_0040_0001_0004$$$::Saber has a point.::
3822::$$$message_0040_0002_0000$$$::But while she's right, if the visitor is just a neighbor, they might get suspicious of Saber.[lr]::
3823::$$$message_0040_0002_0001$$$::The neighbors do think I'm the only one living here.[lr]::
3824::$$$message_0040_0002_0002$$$::Then again...::
3825::$$$message_0040_0003_0000$$$::"Well, guess I'll deal with that if it happens."[lr]::
3826::$$$message_0040_0003_0001$$$::Sakura and Fuji-nee already come and go freely, so there's no point in me worrying about the neighbors.::
3827::$$$message_0040_0004_0000$$$::"All right. Come with me then, Saber. But if the visitor [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] just an ordinary person, keep quiet."[lr]::
3828::$$$message_0040_0004_0001$$$::"I know. I am supposed to be your distant relative, correct?"[lr]::
3829::$$$message_0040_0004_0002$$$::"Yep. That's our story."::
3830::$$$message_0040_0005_0000$$$::"Okay, coming!"[lr]::
3831::$$$message_0040_0005_0001$$$::I rush to the entrance amid the sounds of incessant ringing.::
3832::$$$message_0040_0006_0000$$$::"Pardon my intrusion. I heard you were not feeling well, so I came to visit, Emiya."[lr]::
3833::$$$message_0040_0006_0001$$$::Oh.[lr]::
3834::$$$message_0040_0006_0002$$$::It's not an enemy or a neighbor. It's a friend from school.::
3835::$$$message_0040_0007_0000$$$::"Oh it's just you, Issei."[lr]::
3836::$$$message_0040_0007_0001$$$::"That's a pretty rude greeting. Is that really how you should receive a friend visiting out of concern for you?"[lr]::
3837::$$$message_0040_0007_0002$$$::Even as Issei complains, he hands me a paper bag.::
3838::$$$message_0040_0008_0000$$$::"Hm? What's this? Apples?"[lr]::
3839::$$$message_0040_0008_0001$$$::"A get well soon gift. Considering you hardly ever catch a cold and skip school, I thought I should at least bring something to make you feel better."::
3840::$$$message_0040_0009_0000$$$::"...Hm."[lr]::
3841::$$$message_0040_0009_0001$$$::I'm grateful for his concern, but unfortunately I didn't take a day off because I'm sick.[lr]::
3842::$$$message_0040_0009_0002$$$::And besides, a bag full of apples doesn't seem appropriate for a young guy like him to bring as a get well soon gift.::
3843::$$$message_0040_0010_0000$$$::"What's wrong, Emiya? Did you not like fruit?"[lr]::
3844::$$$message_0040_0010_0001$$$::"No, I do. It's a little complicated, but I really appreciate the sentiment."[lr]::
3845::$$$message_0040_0010_0002$$$::I bow to him to show my appreciation.::
3846::$$$message_0040_0011_0000$$$::"Emiya. This may be a silly question, but who is the woman standing behind you?"[lr]::
3847::$$$message_0040_0011_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
3848::$$$message_0040_0011_0002$$$::Saber is standing just behind me.::
3849::$$$message_0040_0012_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
3850::$$$message_0040_0012_0001$$$::I get it. Issei must have locked eyes with Saber when I bowed to him.::
3851::$$$message_0040_0013_0000$$$::"I've not seen her before... Why is a woman like her at your house?"[lr]::
3852::$$$message_0040_0013_0001$$$::Issei gazes intently at Saber.[lr]::
3853::$$$message_0040_0013_0002$$$::He's extremely shy, and always cold to new people and people he doesn't like.::
3854::$$$message_0040_0014_0000$$$::"Uh, well, her name's Saber and..."[lr]::
3855::$$$message_0040_0014_0001$$$::"I am Shirou's distant relative. I got to know the former master of this house, Kiritsugu, when he was visiting overseas.[lr]::
3856::$$$message_0040_0014_0002$$$::I came here the other day to do some sightseeing, and I was allowed to stay here, given my connections with the family."::
3857::$$$message_0040_0015_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
3858::$$$message_0040_0015_0001$$$::Saber makes the story sound pretty convincing.::
3859::$$$message_0040_0016_0000$$$::"So you are an acquaintance of Emiya's father, I see. I hear he loved traveling, so it's no surprise he'd befriend someone like you in his travels."[lr]::
3860::$$$message_0040_0016_0001$$$::"...WHAT!?"[lr]::
3861::$$$message_0040_0016_0002$$$::Issei, who's supposed to be extremely bashful around strangers, accepts the story so easily.::
3862::$$$message_0040_0017_0000$$$::"I see. I understand the situation now, Emiya.[lr]::
3863::$$$message_0040_0017_0001$$$::Your 'sickness' was just an excuse. You've been showing her around, haven't you?"::
3864::$$$message_0040_0018_0000$$$::"OH. I, uh...yeah, let's say that."[lr]::
3865::$$$message_0040_0018_0001$$$::Well, in broad terms, nothing I've said is entirely untrue...I think.::
3866::$$$message_0040_0019_0000$$$::"Then you won't mind if I come on in. Go prepare some tea for me in appreciation for what I've done for you here. I'd also be happy to tell you about what has happened these past two days at school."[lr]::
3867::$$$message_0040_0019_0001$$$::Issei takes off his shoes and steps up into the house. ::
3868::$$$message_0040_0020_0000$$$::"What do you mean, in appreciation? I'm still kind of busy, you know.[lr]::
3869::$$$message_0040_0020_0001$$$::We can chat another time."[lr]::
3870::$$$message_0040_0020_0002$$$::"What are you talking about? You were the one who abandoned your bike outside our place."::
3871::$$$message_0040_0021_0000$$$::"Oh right...I did leave a bike up in Ryudou Temple."[lr]::
3872::$$$message_0040_0021_0001$$$::"Right? And I brought back your bike.[lr]::
3873::$$$message_0040_0021_0002$$$::I'm busy as well, and yet I didn't go to the student council room. Instead, I went straight home, then brought your bike back here. Are you saying you cannot even offer me some tea after that?"::
3874::$$$message_0040_0022_0000$$$::"...Ugh."[lr]::
3875::$$$message_0040_0022_0001$$$::He [font italic=true]did[font italic=false] do me a favor.[lr]::
3876::$$$message_0040_0022_0002$$$::I might have three bikes, but out of the three, the one I left at Ryudou Temple is the most expensive. And my favorite.::
3877::$$$message_0040_0023_0000$$$::"Sorry Saber, can we take a little break?"[lr]::
3878::$$$message_0040_0023_0001$$$::Saber nods silently.::
3879::$$$message_0040_0024_0000$$$::"Thanks. Then you and Issei can head to the living room. I'll prepare some tea. Japanese tea for Issei, black tea for Saber."::
3880::$$$message_0040_0025_0000$$$::"A-am I also joining? I do not think that is appropriate. Surely you would not be able to have a casual conversations with your friend from school if I am present."::
3881::$$$message_0040_0026_0000$$$::"That's not true. Right, Issei?"[lr]::
3882::$$$message_0040_0026_0001$$$::"Mhm. Girls may be chatty, but I do not mind you, Saber. A woman as humble as you is a precious asset, like cultural heritage."::
3883::$$$message_0040_0027_0000$$$::"Hear that? Okay, so go on ahead."[lr]::
3884::$$$message_0040_0027_0001$$$::"Uh...yes. I understand, but..."::
3885::$$$message_0040_0028_0000$$$::"What. Is something else bothering you?"[lr]::
3886::$$$message_0040_0028_0001$$$::"If you are to prepare tea, I would like Japanese tea as well. I do not mind green tea."[lr]::
3887::$$$message_0040_0028_0002$$$::Saber is fairly opinionated for some reason.[lr]::
3888::$$$message_0040_0028_0003$$$::It's odd, hearing her say that in her usual tone.::
3889::$$$message_0040_0029_0000$$$::After about an hour of meaningless chatter, Issei decides to head home.[lr]::
3890::$$$message_0040_0029_0001$$$::Most of the small talk in the living room was about school, and I asked a few sly questions to find out if anything unusual was going on, but it seems like business as usual.::
3891::$$$message_0040_0030_0000$$$::"I'll see you. Will you be absent tomorrow too, Emiya?"[lr]::
3892::$$$message_0040_0030_0001$$$::"Yeah. I'm not going to school this week. Saber needs to be with me tomorrow too."::
3893::$$$message_0040_0031_0000$$$::"Hm. Well, it shouldn't be much of an issue if you are with her. There are a few suspicious aspects to this, but I've elected not to ask about any of it."[lr]::
3894::$$$message_0040_0031_0001$$$::Issei nods as if satisfied.[lr]::
3895::$$$message_0040_0031_0002$$$::Now that I think about it, how could such a shy guy warm so quickly and easily to Saber?::
3896::$$$message_0040_0032_0000$$$::"Hey, Issei. For this being your first time meeting Saber, you seem to be in a good mood... What's up with that?"[lr]::
3897::$$$message_0040_0032_0001$$$::"What a strange thing to ask. I grew up in a temple, so is it really that odd for me to be able to see the good and bad in someone? I do not know her background, but I saw that her spirit and soul are pure. She cannot possibly be a bad person."::
3898::$$$message_0040_0033_0000$$$::"Huh. I didn't know you could tell that kinda thing. I'm a little impressed."[lr]::
3899::$$$message_0040_0033_0001$$$::"I normally can't, but even an amateur like me can tell when her spirit is on full display like that.[lr]::
3900::$$$message_0040_0033_0002$$$::Even a monk in training will notice the holy presence of a divinity standing right beside them. Simply put, Saber is just that beautiful and pure."::
3901::$$$message_0040_0034_0000$$$::Well that's rare.[lr]::
3902::$$$message_0040_0034_0001$$$::Issei's praising a girl.::
3903::$$$message_0040_0035_0000$$$::"Got it. So you have taken a liking to Saber too."[lr]::
3904::$$$message_0040_0035_0001$$$::That's good.[lr]::
3905::$$$message_0040_0035_0002$$$::I was worried Issei wouldn't like her because all she did was listen to us talking.::
3906::$$$message_0040_0036_0000$$$::"Of course. She's a good person. It would be hard to dislike her."[lr]::
3907::$$$message_0040_0036_0001$$$::"Yeah. And I know she's a good person, even if she might a bit aloof. Saber's always like that, so don't take that to mean she doesn't like you, Issei."::
3908::$$$message_0040_0037_0000$$$::"Eh? She's aloof?"[lr]::
3909::$$$message_0040_0037_0001$$$::"Yeah. I've never seen her laugh before, and even when you and I were laughing pretty hard, she just kept looking stern."[lr]::
3910::$$$message_0040_0037_0002$$$::"Actually, she was smiling pretty often."[lr]::
3911::$$$message_0040_0037_0003$$$::"...Eh?"::
3912::$$$message_0040_0038_0000$$$::That's ridiculous.[lr]::
3913::$$$message_0040_0038_0001$$$::Sure, I've seen the occasional warm expression on Saber's face.[lr]::
3914::$$$message_0040_0038_0002$$$::But I've never seen her actually smile or laugh before.::
3915::$$$message_0040_0039_0000$$$::"You're kidding me. I can't imagine seeing Saber laughing out loud."[lr]::
3916::$$$message_0040_0039_0001$$$::"No, it's not like that.[lr]::
3917::$$$message_0040_0039_0002$$$::She was smiling when she saw you smile. Didn't you notice?"[lr]::
3918::$$$message_0040_0039_0003$$$::    Huh?[lr]::
3919::$$$message_0040_0039_0004$$$::She was smiling when she saw me laugh?::
3920::$$$message_0040_0040_0000$$$::"Um...was she doing that to make fun of me?"[lr]::
3921::$$$message_0040_0040_0001$$$::"Interesting. That's a pretty strange interpretation.[lr]::
3922::$$$message_0040_0040_0002$$$::But you know what, you really shouldn't worry yourself over something like that. Everything begins with questioning yourself, KAH!"::
3923::$$$message_0040_0041_0000$$$::Issei, priest's son that he is, ends with his usual catchphrase, and leaves my house, laughing.[lr]::
3924::$$$message_0040_0041_0001$$$::"Mh...what's with him?"[lr]::
3925::$$$message_0040_0041_0002$$$::He leaves me with his cryptic comments.[lr]::
3926::$$$message_0040_0041_0003$$$::Idiot. At least he could've said goodbye.::
