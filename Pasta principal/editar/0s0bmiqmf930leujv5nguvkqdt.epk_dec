12557::$$$message_0127_0000_0000$$$::   A slash.[lr]::
12558::$$$message_0127_0000_0001$$$::Saber sinks into the ground, all the way to her ankles, as she parries a massive blow.[lr]::
12559::$$$message_0127_0000_0002$$$::The parrying blade is swift, but heavy.[lr]::
12560::$$$message_0127_0000_0003$$$::The axe-sword strikes down from overhead.[lr]::
12561::$$$message_0127_0000_0004$$$::The brutally powerful weapon grazes Saber's armor as she dodges, then tears up the earth itself.::
12562::$$$message_0127_0001_0000$$$::"Nnngggh!"[lr]::
12563::$$$message_0127_0001_0001$$$::My jaw is clenched so hard my teeth could well shatter.[lr]::
12564::$$$message_0127_0001_0002$$$::Is there really nothing I can do?[lr]::
12565::$$$message_0127_0001_0003$$$::I can't protect Saber. I can't fight alongside her.[lr]::
12566::$$$message_0127_0001_0004$$$::There's nothing I can do.[lr]::
12567::$$$message_0127_0001_0005$$$::All I can do is...::
12568::$$$message_0127_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"Then at least imagine it.[font italic=false][lr]::
12569::$$$message_0127_0002_0001$$$::[font italic=true]It's all you can really do."[font italic=false]::
12570::$$$message_0127_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
12571::$$$message_0127_0003_0001$$$::Archer said something like that...::
12572::$$$message_0127_0004_0000$$$::   You don't need an enemy. The only opponent you need to fight is your own mind.::
12573::$$$message_0127_0005_0000$$$::Yeah. What was he saying, again? It wasn't one of his typical snide remarks. What he said had weight and importance to it...and I needed to understand.[lr]::
12574::$$$message_0127_0005_0001$$$::   Then again...[lr]::
12575::$$$message_0127_0005_0002$$$::Probably everything he told me was a warning I shouldn't ignore.::
12576::$$$message_0127_0006_0000$$$::Saber goes flying.[lr]::
12577::$$$message_0127_0006_0001$$$::This time it's not because she leaped away to evade.[lr]::
12578::$$$message_0127_0006_0002$$$::Berserker hit her this time.[lr]::
12579::$$$message_0127_0006_0003$$$::That hurricane slash strikes Saber in the side.::
12580::$$$message_0127_0007_0000$$$::She stumbles.[lr]::
12581::$$$message_0127_0007_0001$$$::Coughing violently, she grips her weapon tighter and turns back toward Berserker.[lr]::
12582::$$$message_0127_0007_0002$$$::The giant doesn't miss the opening Saber finally provides.::
12583::$$$message_0127_0008_0000$$$::"S...top!"[lr]::
12584::$$$message_0127_0008_0001$$$::My voice doesn't reach them.[lr]::
12585::$$$message_0127_0008_0002$$$::Shouting is useless, and trying to use the bow like Archer would be pointless.::
12586::$$$message_0127_0009_0000$$$::Don't I understand yet?[lr]::
12587::$$$message_0127_0009_0001$$$::What can I do?[lr]::
12588::$$$message_0127_0009_0002$$$::What should these hands of mine be doing?[lr]::
12589::$$$message_0127_0009_0003$$$::That's right.[lr]::
12590::$$$message_0127_0009_0004$$$::What do I need to save Saber?::
12591::$$$message_0127_0010_0000$$$::I can't use a bow. A spear won't pierce him. Having a weapon just like the enemy's is no solution either.[lr]::
12592::$$$message_0127_0010_0001$$$::To go up against that giant...[lr]::
12593::$$$message_0127_0010_0002$$$::...a sword to cut through a mountain of stone.[lr]::
12594::$$$message_0127_0010_0003$$$::An opulent sword...sharper than sharp...that will never dull... A king's sword, able to cut down enemies in a single blow...[lr]::
12595::$$$message_0127_0010_0004$$$::Like...[lr]::
12596::$$$message_0127_0010_0005$$$::...that golden sword I saw in my dream... A sword fit for her.::
12597::$$$message_0127_0011_0000$$$::"Kngh...!"[lr]::
12598::$$$message_0127_0011_0001$$$::   My head hurts.[lr]::
12599::$$$message_0127_0011_0002$$$::I try to fight down my nausea, but I never take my eyes off Saber.[lr]::
12600::$$$message_0127_0011_0003$$$::Strangely, the longer I watch Saber fall, the more this indescribable pain assaults me.::
12601::$$$message_0127_0011_0004$$$::Saber and Berserker seem to be moving in slow motion.[lr]::
12602::$$$message_0127_0011_0005$$$::                                                                    I see a row of switches line up.[lr]::
12603::$$$message_0127_0011_0006$$$::Saber coughs, and for a brief second she arches in pain.[lr]::
12604::$$$message_0127_0011_0007$$$::Berserker smashes his axe-sword down toward her with all his might.[lr]::
12605::$$$message_0127_0011_0008$$$::                          It's as if there's a row of nails in need of hammering down.[lr]::
12606::$$$message_0127_0011_0009$$$::It's like he's knocking down dominoes.[lr]::
12607::$$$message_0127_0011_0010$$$::                                                                                           The switch flips.::
12608::$$$message_0127_0012_0000$$$::"Saber!"[lr]::
12609::$$$message_0127_0012_0001$$$::Berserker's axe-sword cuts Saber down.[lr]::
12610::$$$message_0127_0012_0002$$$::She's going to die.[lr]::
12611::$$$message_0127_0012_0003$$$::The strike splits Saber in half at the waist, and pieces of her flesh go flying.::
12612::$$$message_0127_0013_0000$$$::"No...that's not what's happening!"[lr]::
12613::$$$message_0127_0013_0001$$$::The only thing that's gone flying is pieces of armor.[lr]::
12614::$$$message_0127_0013_0002$$$::Berserker's only split Saber's armor.[lr]::
12615::$$$message_0127_0013_0003$$$::Saber left herself open to bait Berserker into a single, huge swing...and with every ounce of strength she has, she rushes at him.::
12616::$$$message_0127_0014_0000$$$::[wacky len=9]![lr]::
12617::$$$message_0127_0014_0001$$$::A black roar rips through the air.[lr]::
12618::$$$message_0127_0014_0002$$$::But he can't escape now. Saber's right in front of him.[lr]::
12619::$$$message_0127_0014_0003$$$::She shifts her grip on her sword and darts in closer, then swings with all her might!::
12620::$$$message_0127_0015_0000$$$::[wacky len=12][lr]::
12621::$$$message_0127_0015_0001$$$::   I don't believe this.[lr]::
12622::$$$message_0127_0015_0002$$$::Saber's attack hits home and the giant, who had seemed so immovable, flies back several meters.::
12623::$$$message_0127_0016_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
12624::$$$message_0127_0016_0001$$$::"Get back, Saber!"[lr]::
12625::$$$message_0127_0016_0002$$$::Then comes the true attack.::
12626::$$$message_0127_0017_0000$$$::   She must intend to release the attack from as close as possible.[lr]::
12627::$$$message_0127_0017_0001$$$::Tohsaka jumps down from the branch above and throws her jewels at Berserker as she falls...::
12628::$$$message_0127_0017_0002$$$::"Neun, acht, sieben...![lr]::
12629::$$$message_0127_0017_0003$$$::Stil, schießt ErschieSsung!::
12630::$$$message_0127_0017_0004$$$::Shards of ice rain on Berserker.[lr]::
12631::$$$message_0127_0017_0005$$$::Among those shards are three giant, spear-shaped icicles, each packed with enough magical energy to blow an entire mansion to smithereens!::
12632::$$$message_0127_0018_0000$$$::"No, dodge it, Berserker!"[lr]::
12633::$$$message_0127_0018_0001$$$::Illya, quiet until now, suddenly screams at her Servant.[lr]::
12634::$$$message_0127_0018_0002$$$::She must have sensed the danger, but too late.[lr]::
12635::$$$message_0127_0018_0003$$$::The ice spears aren't [font italic=true]falling[font italic=false].[lr]::
12636::$$$message_0127_0018_0004$$$::They're accelerating toward Berserker.::
12637::$$$message_0127_0019_0000$$$::He can't possibly dodge.[lr]::
12638::$$$message_0127_0019_0001$$$::A one-in-a-million opportunity... Saber's desperate attack perfectly coordinated with the ice bullet attacks.[lr]::
12639::$$$message_0127_0019_0002$$$::It has more than enough magical energy to kill Berserker.::
12640::$$$message_0127_0020_0000$$$::However...[lr]::
12641::$$$message_0127_0020_0001$$$::[wacky len=3] [wacky len=9]!!![lr]::
12642::$$$message_0127_0020_0002$$$::The axe-sword slices through the air.[lr]::
12643::$$$message_0127_0020_0003$$$::Even as Saber drives him back, he switches to a single-handed grip on his axe-sword and shatters all three ice spears.::
12644::$$$message_0127_0021_0000$$$::   Blood splatters the clearing.[lr]::
12645::$$$message_0127_0021_0001$$$::Maybe it's his one-armed swing, but he fails to completely destroy the ice, and when it strikes, it severs one of Berserker's arms.[lr]::
12646::$$$message_0127_0021_0002$$$::That's not all.[lr]::
12647::$$$message_0127_0021_0003$$$::The ice freezes over Berserker's arm, completely restraining it.::
12648::$$$message_0127_0022_0000$$$::But it only got one arm.[lr]::
12649::$$$message_0127_0022_0001$$$::"Wha...!"[lr]::
12650::$$$message_0127_0022_0002$$$::Saber cries out.[lr]::
12651::$$$message_0127_0022_0003$$$::   It's a reasonable response.[lr]::
12652::$$$message_0127_0022_0004$$$::Berserker catches Tohsaka with his good arm as she falls.::
12653::$$$message_0127_0023_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
12654::$$$message_0127_0023_0001$$$::Tohsaka's face twists in pain.[lr]::
12655::$$$message_0127_0023_0002$$$::Berserker will have no trouble crushing Tohsaka with his hand.::
12656::$$$message_0127_0024_0000$$$::"T-TOHSAKA!!!"[lr]::
12657::$$$message_0127_0024_0001$$$::I run.[lr]::
12658::$$$message_0127_0024_0002$$$::I don't care if I drag them down.[lr]::
12659::$$$message_0127_0024_0003$$$::It doesn't matter if I can't do anything.[lr]::
12660::$$$message_0127_0024_0004$$$::I'm not going to let Tohsaka die!::
12661::$$$message_0127_0025_0000$$$::"Rin!"[lr]::
12662::$$$message_0127_0025_0001$$$::Saber must be too weak to even stand, but somehow she gets to her feet.[lr]::
12663::$$$message_0127_0025_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
12664::$$$message_0127_0025_0003$$$::Tohsaka must be in agonizing pain, but she stretches a hand out as she hangs her head downward.[lr]::
12665::$$$message_0127_0025_0004$$$::    And then...::
12666::$$$message_0127_0026_0000$$$::"Heh. Just as I thought."[lr]::
12667::$$$message_0127_0026_0001$$$::She grins wickedly.::
12668::$$$message_0127_0027_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
12669::$$$message_0127_0027_0001$$$::Everyone gasps.[lr]::
12670::$$$message_0127_0027_0002$$$::Saber, me, and even Berserker must have all frozen in our tracks.[lr]::
12671::$$$message_0127_0027_0003$$$::   One person can only have so many tricks up their sleeve.[lr]::
12672::$$$message_0127_0027_0004$$$::She knew this might happen, and she hadn't even bothered to tell us!::
12673::$$$message_0127_0028_0000$$$::[wacky len=12]![lr]::
12674::$$$message_0127_0028_0001$$$::Berserker squeezes harder around her.[lr]::
12675::$$$message_0127_0028_0002$$$::He's a heartbeat too late.[lr]::
12676::$$$message_0127_0028_0003$$$::"Got you!"::
12677::$$$message_0127_0029_0000$$$::Four bullets of pure light streak toward Berserker.[lr]::
12678::$$$message_0127_0029_0001$$$::Four bullets. Four gems.[lr]::
12679::$$$message_0127_0029_0002$$$::Four rapid shots at the most extreme close range... That has to be enough to end the dark, mad warrior.::
12680::$$$message_0127_0030_0000$$$::Or rather...[lr]::
12681::$$$message_0127_0030_0001$$$::The attack perfectly, completely snuffs out his life.::
12682::$$$message_0127_0031_0000$$$::It must have blown Berserker's head clean off.[lr]::
12683::$$$message_0127_0031_0001$$$::The blood splatter even reaches me, ten meters from where Berserker stands.::
12684::$$$message_0127_0032_0000$$$::There's...kind of a lot more than blood in the mess, but I don't think she overdid it.[lr]::
12685::$$$message_0127_0032_0001$$$::Our opponent was a monster.[lr]::
12686::$$$message_0127_0032_0002$$$::Berserker would have crushed Tohsaka if she hadn't blown his head off.::
12687::$$$message_0127_0033_0000$$$::"Phew..."[lr]::
12688::$$$message_0127_0033_0001$$$::I slow my frantic run.[lr]::
12689::$$$message_0127_0033_0002$$$::Tohsaka is still in Berserker's grip, but the battle's over.[lr]::
12690::$$$message_0127_0033_0003$$$::Berserker's face is still hidden in a plume of smoke.[lr]::
12691::$$$message_0127_0033_0004$$$::From that singing sound, it must have been a hell of an explo[line2]::
12692::$$$message_0127_0034_0000$$$::"No way."[lr]::
12693::$$$message_0127_0034_0001$$$::I hear Tohsaka's voice.[lr]::
12694::$$$message_0127_0034_0002$$$::She's looking at the smoke in disbelief.::
12695::$$$message_0127_0035_0000$$$::    Hold on.[lr]::
12696::$$$message_0127_0035_0001$$$::Am I imagining things?[lr]::
12697::$$$message_0127_0035_0002$$$::Did Berserker's hand tighten on Tohsaka?::
12698::$$$message_0127_0036_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
12699::$$$message_0127_0036_0001$$$::Tohsaka's staring at the plume of smoke.[lr]::
12700::$$$message_0127_0036_0002$$$::It doesn't last long.[lr]::
12701::$$$message_0127_0036_0003$$$::The smoke starts to dissipate.[lr]::
12702::$$$message_0127_0036_0004$$$::And in the clearing air...[lr]::
12703::$$$message_0127_0036_0005$$$::...Berserker's face[line2]the face that should've been blown off his body[line2]appears.::
12704::$$$message_0127_0037_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
12705::$$$message_0127_0037_0001$$$::Tohsaka cowers under that evil demon's gaze, at a loss for words.[lr]::
12706::$$$message_0127_0037_0002$$$::"Fufu. Ufufu. Ahahahaha!"[lr]::
12707::$$$message_0127_0037_0003$$$::Laughter fills the air.[lr]::
12708::$$$message_0127_0037_0004$$$::Illya, who's remained at the far side of the clearing, laughs delightedly.::
12709::$$$message_0127_0038_0000$$$::"I see you in a new light, Rin. I didn't think you could have possibly killed Berserker, even once.[lr]::
12710::$$$message_0127_0038_0001$$$::But too bad. Berserker won't disappear that easily. You see, he can't die unless he's killed twelve times."::
12711::$$$message_0127_0039_0000$$$::"Killed...twelve times?"[lr]::
12712::$$$message_0127_0039_0001$$$::She must have figured something out from what Illya just told her.[lr]::
12713::$$$message_0127_0039_0002$$$::Tohsaka looks aghast, her face twisting in regret.::
12714::$$$message_0127_0040_0000$$$::"I...get it.[lr]::
12715::$$$message_0127_0040_0001$$$::I should've figured it out as soon as I learned his True Name. Heracles should have the bow of Hydra, but his only weapon was a rock.[lr]::
12716::$$$message_0127_0040_0002$$$::His Noble Phantasm isn't an object he's carrying. The symbol for the hero Heracles is[line2]"::
12717::$$$message_0127_0041_0000$$$::"That's right. His body itself is his Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
12718::$$$message_0127_0041_0001$$$::You should know about Heracles's twelve labors. The Greek hero Heracles overcame twelve monumental tasks to atone for his sins, and his reward was immortality.[lr]::
12719::$$$message_0127_0041_0002$$$::You know exactly what that means, don't you?"[lr]::
12720::$$$message_0127_0041_0003$$$::"A stockpile of lives...layers of resurrection magecraft."::
12721::$$$message_0127_0042_0000$$$::"Yep. That's why he can't die easily. He possesses the curse of immortality given by the gods so that he can endure the same number of trials, or deaths, he once overcame.[lr]::
12722::$$$message_0127_0042_0001$$$::That's my Berserker's Noble Phantasm: God Hand."::
12723::$$$message_0127_0043_0000$$$::"Understand? You killed Berserker there, but he still has five lives left.[lr]::
12724::$$$message_0127_0043_0001$$$::Fufu. You were so close, Rin. Berserker would have disappeared if you'd only used five times the jewels you just did."::
12725::$$$message_0127_0044_0000$$$::I can't hear Illya's voice clearly.[lr]::
12726::$$$message_0127_0044_0001$$$::From the corner of my eye, I see Saber charging Berserker.::
12727::$$$message_0127_0045_0000$$$::"Rin, run!"[lr]::
12728::$$$message_0127_0045_0001$$$::Saber dashes over.[lr]::
12729::$$$message_0127_0045_0002$$$::Tohsaka tries to pry open Berserker's fingers, but they won't budge.[lr]::
12730::$$$message_0127_0045_0003$$$::And then...::
12731::$$$message_0127_0046_0000$$$::"It's okay, Berserker. Crush her."::
12732::$$$message_0127_0047_0000$$$::The burning eyes glare at Tohsaka.[lr]::
12733::$$$message_0127_0047_0001$$$::"Ah...kyAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!"[lr]::
12734::$$$message_0127_0047_0002$$$::Tohsaka screams.[lr]::
12735::$$$message_0127_0047_0003$$$::Berserker's enormous fingers dig into Tohsaka, trying to rip out her insides.[lr]::
12736::$$$message_0127_0047_0004$$$::There's only one outcome...[lr]::
12737::$$$message_0127_0047_0005$$$::...Tohsaka's lifeless body being crushed to nothing.::

12743::$$$message_0127_0049_0001$$$::Saber cuts towards Berserker.[lr]::
12744::$$$message_0127_0049_0002$$$::Her invisible sword swings at Berserker's defenseless arm, as if slicing through a radish.[lr]::
12745::$$$message_0127_0049_0003$$$::But it's no use.::
12746::$$$message_0127_0050_0000$$$::Saber's attack pings harmlessly off of Berserker's arm. His grip on Tohsaka doesn't loosen.[lr]::
12747::$$$message_0127_0050_0001$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
12748::$$$message_0127_0050_0002$$$::Just moving must be agony for Saber.[lr]::
12749::$$$message_0127_0050_0003$$$::She swings her sword desperately, blood trickling from her mouth.::
12750::$$$message_0127_0051_0000$$$::"Wha...Shirou!?"[lr]::
12751::$$$message_0127_0051_0001$$$::She freezes the instant she sees me rushing at Berserker.::
12752::$$$message_0127_0052_0000$$$::"Let go of her, you bastard!"[lr]::
12753::$$$message_0127_0052_0001$$$::I slap mindlessly at his back with my bow.[lr]::
12754::$$$message_0127_0052_0002$$$::The giant is unfazed.[lr]::
12755::$$$message_0127_0052_0003$$$::He doesn't consider me a threat.::
12756::$$$message_0127_0053_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
12757::$$$message_0127_0053_0001$$$::My fingers are getting numb.[lr]::
12758::$$$message_0127_0053_0002$$$::What the hell is he, if I'm the one going numb from hitting him?::
12759::$$$message_0127_0054_0000$$$::"Run, Shirou!"[lr]::
12760::$$$message_0127_0054_0001$$$::Eh?[lr]::
12761::$$$message_0127_0054_0002$$$::I look up when I hear Saber.[lr]::
12762::$$$message_0127_0054_0003$$$::In that instant...[lr]::
12763::$$$message_0127_0054_0004$$$::I go flying through the air like a leaf.::
12764::$$$message_0127_0055_0000$$$::"...Gah."[lr]::
12765::$$$message_0127_0055_0001$$$::I hit the ground and tumble like a bit of stray garbage.[lr]::
12766::$$$message_0127_0055_0002$$$::   Berserker smacked me away with that frozen sword.[lr]::
12767::$$$message_0127_0055_0003$$$::I try to block the attack with my bow, but it shatters instantly and I'm thrown so...far...away...::
12768::$$$message_0127_0056_0000$$$::"Gah...ah...ha...!!!"[lr]::
12769::$$$message_0127_0056_0001$$$::I writhe in pain.[lr]::
12770::$$$message_0127_0056_0002$$$::That breaking sound hadn't come from the bow.[lr]::
12771::$$$message_0127_0056_0003$$$::One of my arms is bent at the wrong angle...in the wrong spot.[lr]::
12772::$$$message_0127_0056_0004$$$::When I breathe in, my lungs hurt so bad I want to puke them up.::
12773::$$$message_0127_0057_0000$$$::"Ha...ah...goh...!"[lr]::
12774::$$$message_0127_0057_0001$$$::I can't breathe properly with all the blood flooding my mouth.[lr]::
12775::$$$message_0127_0057_0002$$$::But that doesn't matter.[lr]::
12776::$$$message_0127_0057_0003$$$::Breathing will just make me pass out.[lr]::
12777::$$$message_0127_0057_0004$$$::Better that I not breathe.::
12778::$$$message_0127_0058_0000$$$::"Ha...hah...ha...!"[lr]::
12779::$$$message_0127_0058_0001$$$::I wake up.[lr]::
12780::$$$message_0127_0058_0002$$$::Right now, I need to get to him...him...!::
12781::$$$message_0127_0059_0000$$$::I run.[lr]::
12782::$$$message_0127_0059_0001$$$::It's my turn. I'm going to break his arm and save Tohsaka.[lr]::
12783::$$$message_0127_0059_0002$$$::He must have eyes in the back of his head. He swings his sword casually, like he's batting aside a fly.::
12784::$$$message_0127_0060_0000$$$::I can dodge it.[lr]::
12785::$$$message_0127_0060_0001$$$::I won't let an arm that's completely frozen hit me so easily!::
12786::$$$message_0127_0061_0000$$$::"Ha...!"[lr]::
12787::$$$message_0127_0061_0001$$$::Damn...my body's sinking...![lr]::
12788::$$$message_0127_0061_0002$$$::He must have grazed my leg. Damn him! He didn't even touch my leg, but he somehow managed to break it anyway!::
12789::$$$message_0127_0062_0000$$$::"Ridiculous! That is enough. Stay back, Master!"[lr]::
12790::$$$message_0127_0062_0001$$$::I can't do that.[lr]::
12791::$$$message_0127_0062_0002$$$::I can't let Tohsaka die.[lr]::
12792::$$$message_0127_0062_0003$$$::What do I need to do to save her?::
12793::$$$message_0127_0063_0000$$$::A weapon. A blade would be best. At my feet, broken pieces of the bow. Above me, Berserker's sword swinging right at me. There's no time to think. I let magical energy flow through me.[lr]::
12794::$$$message_0127_0063_0001$$$::The Strengthening succeeds easily, but down comes Berserker's sword. The fragments are completely, finally pulverized. I meant to dodge, but instead my body slams to the ground. Clearly there was no point Strengthening broken shards. I'll have to do this from scratch.[lr]::
12795::$$$message_0127_0063_0002$$$::It shouldn't be impossible. Anyone can imitate, as long as they have an example to follow. I just need to duplicate the foundation, structure, work, experience, time, and...::
12796::$$$message_0127_0064_0000$$$::[wacky len=12][lr]::
12797::$$$message_0127_0064_0001$$$::The giant turns around.[lr]::
12798::$$$message_0127_0064_0002$$$::It must have decided to kill the little nuisance before finishing Tohsaka off.::
12799::$$$message_0127_0065_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
12800::$$$message_0127_0065_0001$$$::I push up from the ground and glare at the giant.[lr]::
12801::$$$message_0127_0065_0002$$$::There's no fear. I'm too burned out for fear.[lr]::
12802::$$$message_0127_0065_0003$$$::But behind me...::
12803::$$$message_0127_0066_0000$$$::I see someone prepared to disappear.[lr]::
12804::$$$message_0127_0066_0001$$$::I see someone determined to use the sacred sword.::
