51806::$$$message_0447_0000_0000$$$::"Whew, I'm tired."[lr]::
51807::$$$message_0447_0000_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Thump[font italic=false].[lr]::
51808::$$$message_0447_0000_0002$$$::I set my travel bag overstuffed with gifts on the ground, and stretch for a few seconds.[lr]::
51809::$$$message_0447_0000_0003$$$::The sky today is crystal clear, and the spring sunshine feels great, no question.::
51810::$$$message_0447_0001_0000$$$::Eh, it's bright for my eyes that got used to the interior of the plane, but it's a small price to pay, considering I just got back from a long trip.::
51811::$$$message_0447_0002_0000$$$::"Oh, Verde's gone. They put a theater there instead... This place changed while I was gone."[lr]::
51812::$$$message_0447_0002_0001$$$::I look out at the town while loosening my shoulders.[lr]::
51813::$$$message_0447_0002_0002$$$::The trip from London to this provincial Japanese city took twenty-five hours.[lr]::
51814::$$$message_0447_0002_0003$$$::I feel cramped after being stuffed into an airplane seat for that long. My butt hurts, and I even bumped my head on the ceiling when we landed."::
51815::$$$message_0447_0003_0000$$$::"...Can't even call that economy class. I should've stuck with a reputable airline, at least."[lr]::
51816::$$$message_0447_0003_0001$$$::Moral of the story: don't cheap out on long-haul travel.::
51817::$$$message_0447_0004_0000$$$::Even if I'm strapped for cash and my rival for class leader, Luviagelita, goes: ::
51818::$$$message_0447_0005_0000$$$::"Oh dear, Miss Tohsaka. If you find yourself indigent, I can offer you a position as my personal maid. Why, I'll even guarantee you a monthly wage equivalent to the yearly pay of a waitress from that cheap, seedy cafe down on Fourth Street, ohoho! Ah, I'm quite serious. Do submit your application first thing tomorrow morning,"::
51819::$$$message_0447_0006_0000$$$::it wouldn't do to be a cheapskate when returning to my home country.::
51820::$$$message_0447_0007_0000$$$::Yeah, I'll make sure to do that next time.[lr]::
51821::$$$message_0447_0007_0001$$$::I have a round-trip ticket, so I'll put up with that run-down jet one last time on the way back.::
51822::$$$message_0447_0008_0000$$$::"Um, the bus is...twenty minutes away, huh.[lr]::
51823::$$$message_0447_0008_0001$$$::...Eh, I'll go for a walk. Beats waiting."[lr]::
51824::$$$message_0447_0008_0002$$$::I heave my backpack with both hands and start walking.[lr]::
51825::$$$message_0447_0008_0003$$$::It's an hour's walk to the house.[lr]::
51826::$$$message_0447_0008_0004$$$::It'll take a while, but I still have plenty of time until we're supposed to meet, so this is perfect.::
51827::$$$message_0447_0009_0000$$$::"...Mm. This sea breeze sure takes me back."[lr]::
51828::$$$message_0447_0009_0001$$$::I narrow my eyes against the wind, listening to cars go by.::
51829::$$$message_0447_0010_0000$$$::    Yeah. I'm home.[lr]::
51830::$$$message_0447_0010_0001$$$::In the year I've been gone, my hometown looks kinda different, but it hasn't changed at all.::
51831::$$$message_0447_0011_0000$$$::I react to the mundane, formerly familiar scenery of my town with alternating boredom and surprise while I walk the path home.[lr]::
51832::$$$message_0447_0011_0001$$$::This is my first annual visit home since I left to study in London.[lr]::
51833::$$$message_0447_0011_0002$$$::Just walking through the town after a year makes me happy, and it feels fun for no reason.[lr]::
51834::$$$message_0447_0011_0003$$$::Though the mood is slightly spoiled by my stupidly heavy bag.::
51835::$$$message_0447_0012_0000$$$::"...Alright. That should be okay, I think."[lr]::
51836::$$$message_0447_0012_0001$$$::I take a shower and check myself in the mirror to make sure nothing's wrong.[lr]::
51837::$$$message_0447_0012_0002$$$::...I'm not really doing it for anyone's benefit, but it just feels right to pay a little attention to my looks after being gone for a whole year.[lr]::
51838::$$$message_0447_0012_0003$$$::Ahh, okay, maybe there's one person who would side-eye me if I didn't, but I'll ignore it for today.::
51839::$$$message_0447_0013_0000$$$::The house is prettier than I remember, and I can't spot a single speck of dust.[lr]::
51840::$$$message_0447_0013_0001$$$::Sakura might still be cleaning it from time to time.[lr]::
51841::$$$message_0447_0013_0002$$$::I appreciate that, I do, but...::
51842::$$$message_0447_0014_0000$$$::"...I hope she didn't use this place for anything weird... I didn't recognize that bottle of shampoo."[lr]::
51843::$$$message_0447_0014_0001$$$::Shampoo belongs in the bath. Not in the library, not in the kitchen, not at the front door, and not in the garden.[lr]::
51844::$$$message_0447_0014_0002$$$::Well...[lr]::
51845::$$$message_0447_0014_0003$$$::It's nothing to worry about, really, but it's still pretty suggestive.::
51846::$$$message_0447_0015_0000$$$::"...Wait, it's already three! Ah, crud, what have I been doing for the last two hours!?"[lr]::
51847::$$$message_0447_0015_0001$$$::I dash to the front door, try on my pumps for a change, decide it's tacky, and run out the door in my normal shoes.::
51848::$$$message_0447_0016_0000$$$::We're supposed to meet at four o'clock.[lr]::
51849::$$$message_0447_0016_0001$$$::I was hoping to get there early and scout out the enemy, but now I'm at a disadvantage with my messed-up hair.[lr]::
51850::$$$message_0447_0016_0002$$$::It's regrettable, but I'll just have to challenge them head-on.::
51851::$$$message_0447_0017_0000$$$::"Now, then..."[lr]::
51852::$$$message_0447_0017_0001$$$::It's a sentimental moment in a lot of ways, but now that I'm here, I rid myself of distracting thoughts and want to head inside as soon as possible.::
51853::$$$message_0447_0018_0000$$$::I go through the front gate and walk up to the house door.[lr]::
51854::$$$message_0447_0018_0001$$$::Then I ring the doorbell.[lr]::
51855::$$$message_0447_0018_0002$$$::It makes a silly [font italic=true]ding-dong[font italic=false], and the door rattles open.::
51856::$$$message_0447_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51857::$$$message_0447_0019_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51858::$$$message_0447_0019_0002$$$::Wow.[lr]::
51859::$$$message_0447_0019_0003$$$::What's the surprise, you ask? Rider just answered the door in regular clothes.::
51860::$$$message_0447_0020_0000$$$::"I'm back. I'm a little early, but I'm here.[lr]::
51861::$$$message_0447_0020_0001$$$::Is Sakura here, Rider?"[lr]::
51862::$$$message_0447_0020_0002$$$::"...Yes. Sakura is in her room, and Taiga is waiting in the living room."::
51863::$$$message_0447_0021_0000$$$::"Oh, Ms. Fujimura's here, too... Right, she'd be on spring break now. Guess I'll make myself at home. Should I go to the living room for now?"[lr]::
51864::$$$message_0447_0021_0001$$$::"Yes. I will call Sakura."[lr]::
51865::$$$message_0447_0021_0002$$$::I go into the hallway.[lr]::
51866::$$$message_0447_0021_0003$$$::On the way to the living room, I steal a glance at Rider.::
51867::$$$message_0447_0022_0000$$$::...Should I call this a well-laid ambush?[lr]::
51868::$$$message_0447_0022_0001$$$::I know she was a beauty cursed by the gods, but it really stands out when she's dressed in normal clothes.::
51869::$$$message_0447_0023_0000$$$::To be frank, she's supermodel-tier.[lr]::
51870::$$$message_0447_0023_0001$$$::When a woman thinks another woman is beautiful, she really means it.[lr]::
51871::$$$message_0447_0023_0002$$$::I met a lot of pretty women overseas, but I haven't come across anyone on Rider's level yet.::
51872::$$$message_0447_0024_0000$$$::She's more than human though, so it makes sense, I guess.[lr]::
51873::$$$message_0447_0024_0001$$$::Anyway, she's a legitimate Servant.[lr]::
51874::$$$message_0447_0024_0002$$$::If a Eulyphis mage saw her, they'd have to take three days off from work, and if you told them she's a familiar, they'd lock themselves in their atelier for a whole month.::
51875::$$$message_0447_0025_0000$$$::"Rin? Did you want to speak to me?"[lr]::
51876::$$$message_0447_0025_0001$$$::"Mm, yeah. How's he doing? Is he getting used to the situation at all?"::
51877::$$$message_0447_0026_0000$$$::"...Yes, he's more stable than he was two years ago.[lr]::
51878::$$$message_0447_0026_0001$$$::He's been unstable since you left, but improved about a month ago. Sakura must have figured something out."::
51879::$$$message_0447_0027_0000$$$::"Cool. I wasn't really worried because you and Sakura have good chemistry. ...Um, you haven't been taking any blood without letting her know, have you?"[lr]::
51880::$$$message_0447_0027_0001$$$::I'm not really scolding her. She can drink if she wants to, but I worry about whether she's following up properly.::
51881::$$$message_0447_0028_0000$$$::"There is no need to worry. I would never be as careless as to let her know."[lr]::
51882::$$$message_0447_0028_0001$$$::"..."::
51883::$$$message_0447_0029_0000$$$::That's a weird way to answer it, but I'll let it slide if she isn't causing any trouble.[lr]::
51884::$$$message_0447_0029_0001$$$::It's just my bad habit as a mage.[lr]::
51885::$$$message_0447_0029_0002$$$::A familiar like Rider is way too valuable, so I pretend to overlook some mischief.::
51886::$$$message_0447_0030_0000$$$::"I will see you soon. I want to consult you about something, as well. Could you make some time for me tonight?"[lr]::
51887::$$$message_0447_0030_0001$$$::"Huh. If it's private, we should talk at my house, not here. I'm staying over tonight, so can we do it tomorrow?"[lr]::
51888::$$$message_0447_0030_0002$$$::Rider nods quietly and leaves for Sakura's room.::
51889::$$$message_0447_0031_0000$$$::...But then, she pauses.[lr]::
51890::$$$message_0447_0031_0001$$$::"Welcome home, Rin."[lr]::
51891::$$$message_0447_0031_0002$$$::"Thanks. I appreciate you taking care of things while I was gone, Rider."::
51892::$$$message_0447_0032_0000$$$::She smiles back at me and goes off to the tatami room.[lr]::
51893::$$$message_0447_0032_0001$$$::...[font italic=true]Wow[font italic=false].[lr]::
51894::$$$message_0447_0032_0002$$$::She really is beautiful.::
51895::$$$message_0447_0033_0000$$$::"Oh! Welcome, Miss Tohsaka. Glad to see you doing well."[lr]::
51896::$$$message_0447_0033_0001$$$::"Pardon the intrusion. I'm relieved to see you haven't changed either, Ms. Fujimura. Are you taking a break from morning practice today?"::
51897::$$$message_0447_0034_0000$$$::"Yeah, I took the whole day off when I heard you were coming. The captain this year is dependable, and today's a recruitment meeting, so it should be fine."[lr]::
51898::$$$message_0447_0034_0001$$$::"Recruitment meeting? Has the kyudo club been losing members?"::
51899::$$$message_0447_0035_0000$$$::"Mm, it's been growing, actually. Sakura became the captain last year, remember? So there are more boys now, but girls aren't staying on long-term.[lr]::
51900::$$$message_0447_0035_0001$$$::...Oh, you graduated, so you won't know.[lr]::
51901::$$$message_0447_0035_0002$$$::This year's captain is a cool boy, so we should pick up a lot more if he does his job well."::
51902::$$$message_0447_0036_0000$$$::"Huh. Which boy?"[lr]::
51903::$$$message_0447_0036_0001$$$::"Miss Mitsuzuri's little brother. He's a timid kid, the polar opposite of his sister. I'm sure he's going to freeze up on stage when he gives the club introduction."::
51904::$$$message_0447_0037_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
51905::$$$message_0447_0037_0001$$$::Doesn't that mean you picked the wrong person to lead?[lr]::
51906::$$$message_0447_0037_0002$$$::Well, kyudo has a pretty strict image, so girls might go for something with a softer appeal... But still, Ayako's brother, huh? I never even knew she had a brother.::
51907::$$$message_0447_0038_0000$$$::"How's life on the other side? Is anyone bullying you for being Japanese? You know, arts college students actually form friendships through their rivalries."::
51908::$$$message_0447_0039_0000$$$::"Ms. Fujimura, that's a stereotype. People who devote their lives to art aren't that narrow-minded."[lr]::
51909::$$$message_0447_0039_0001$$$::"Ah. Tee-hee. I made you mad."::
51910::$$$message_0447_0040_0000$$$::...I can't bring myself to tell her that they only care about themselves.[lr]::
51911::$$$message_0447_0040_0001$$$::On top of that, my department would crank her anxiety up to 100%, so I won't bring it up.::
51912::$$$message_0447_0041_0000$$$::...Then,[lr]::
51913::$$$message_0447_0041_0001$$$::I see Ms. Fujimura giving me a meaningful grin.::
51914::$$$message_0447_0042_0000$$$::"What is it, Ms. Fujimura?"[lr]::
51915::$$$message_0447_0042_0001$$$::"Hm? I was just thinking how pretty you are now, Miss Tohsaka. It's like you've shed your skin, or you've grown up. Did you meet anyone nice over there?"::
51916::$$$message_0447_0043_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51917::$$$message_0447_0043_0001$$$::...Anyone "nice"? Why do girls always end up talking about this stuff? And she's weirdly perceptive.::
51918::$$$message_0447_0044_0000$$$::"Ah. Sounds like I was right. How's London? It's a city of flowers, right? Y'know, you might have a chance encounter, get chased by a mysterious organization while holding hands, and with only ten minutes left, share a farewell kiss under the burning bridge, you know?"::
51919::$$$message_0447_0045_0000$$$::"No. Nothing like that."[lr]::
51920::$$$message_0447_0045_0001$$$::"Mrgh. Nothing to share at all, then?"[lr]::
51921::$$$message_0447_0045_0002$$$::"......Not exactly.[lr]::
51922::$$$message_0447_0045_0003$$$::I mean, maybe there is someone, and maybe there isn't."::
51923::$$$message_0447_0046_0000$$$::...I can't help but give a half-hearted answer.[lr]::
51924::$$$message_0447_0046_0001$$$::I've accepted some invitations of that kind, and I would like to have a research partner soon.::
51925::$$$message_0447_0047_0000$$$::...But I just can't get serious about any of them.[lr]::
51926::$$$message_0447_0047_0001$$$::When I try dating a guy, my thoughts always go to some other idiot and I can't concentrate.[lr]::
51927::$$$message_0447_0047_0002$$$::Every day, I've been wracking my brain about it. I hate to admit it, but I might actually be head over heels for him.[lr]::
51928::$$$message_0447_0047_0003$$$::...No.[lr]::
51929::$$$message_0447_0047_0004$$$::No way. Can't be. Nuh-uh[line2]::
51930::$$$message_0447_0048_0000$$$::"Oh, Sakura."[lr]::
51931::$$$message_0447_0048_0001$$$::"...!?"[lr]::
51932::$$$message_0447_0048_0002$$$::I jolt upright in my seat.[lr]::
51933::$$$message_0447_0048_0003$$$::Sakura looks confused.[lr]::
51934::$$$message_0447_0048_0004$$$::...Wow. She hasn't changed at all.::
51935::$$$message_0447_0049_0000$$$::"H-hi. Everything good, Sakura?"[lr]::
51936::$$$message_0447_0049_0001$$$::Sakura nods.[lr]::
51937::$$$message_0447_0049_0002$$$::Her face lights up...[lr]::
51938::$$$message_0447_0049_0003$$$::"Welcome home, Nee-san. I'm happy you look well."[lr]::
51939::$$$message_0447_0049_0004$$$::...and she celebrates my return with a radiant smile.::
51940::$$$message_0447_0050_0000$$$::We spend an hour together.[lr]::
51941::$$$message_0447_0050_0001$$$::We trade stories about things that happened in the year I've been gone and happily chitchat about silly things.::
51942::$$$message_0447_0051_0000$$$::"Huh. You already graduated, Sakura. What's next? I can get you in on my recommendation if you want to come over."::
51943::$$$message_0447_0052_0000$$$::"I appreciate it, but I think I'll decline.[lr]::
51944::$$$message_0447_0052_0001$$$::I have something to do here, and there's someone I can study under, too."::
51945::$$$message_0447_0053_0000$$$::"Mm. Kirei's replacement you wrote about, right? ...Well, he seems like a nice old man, and it's probably better than going to London.[lr]::
51946::$$$message_0447_0053_0001$$$::You should still get out and adventure sometime.[lr]::
51947::$$$message_0447_0053_0002$$$::I know you like to sit around at home, so you need a lively teacher."::
51948::$$$message_0447_0054_0000$$$::"Oh, I'm fine on that front. Rider's incredibly strict.[lr]::
51949::$$$message_0447_0054_0001$$$::If I slack off at all, she makes a super scary face."[lr]::
51950::$$$message_0447_0054_0002$$$::"Ahh... Yeah, that does sound scary."[lr]::
51951::$$$message_0447_0054_0003$$$::She's got Mystic Eyes of Petrification, after all.[lr]::
51952::$$$message_0447_0054_0004$$$::If she got seriously angry and used her power, it wouldn't stop at just her clothes.::
51953::$$$message_0447_0055_0000$$$::...Wait.[lr]::
51954::$$$message_0447_0055_0001$$$::Ms. Fujimura looks a little down.::
51955::$$$message_0447_0056_0000$$$::"Ms. Fujimura?"[lr]::
51956::$$$message_0447_0056_0001$$$::"Huh? Uh, what? Sorry, I wasn't listening."::
51957::$$$message_0447_0057_0000$$$::"No, it's not that, but... you suddenly went quiet, so we were curious."[lr]::
51958::$$$message_0447_0057_0001$$$::"Oh, yeah...[lr]::
51959::$$$message_0447_0057_0002$$$::When I watch you two, I'm reminded of Shirou. He'd be incredibly lucky if he were here right now, but that kid always screws up when it counts."::
51960::$$$message_0447_0058_0000$$$::"Aw, man. He sure is late today. I wonder when he'll be back."[lr]::
51961::$$$message_0447_0058_0001$$$::Ms. Fujimura holds her cup of tea, staring out the window.[lr]::
51962::$$$message_0447_0058_0002$$$::Her eyes look distant.[lr]::
51963::$$$message_0447_0058_0003$$$::She gazes out at the pleasantly cloudless, blue sky.::
51964::$$$message_0447_0059_0000$$$::"Ah... Oh, I just made things awkward.[lr]::
51965::$$$message_0447_0059_0001$$$::...Um, I guess that's my fault."[lr]::
51966::$$$message_0447_0059_0002$$$::"You didn't do anything wrong. I'm happy to hear you talk about Senpai."::
51967::$$$message_0447_0060_0000$$$::"Ahaha, come on, Sakura. He isn't your upperclassman anymore.[lr]::
51968::$$$message_0447_0060_0001$$$::...Anyway, I suddenly wanna move my body, so I'm going to go do some drills in the dojo."[lr]::
51969::$$$message_0447_0060_0002$$$::Ms. Fujimura excuses herself. Maybe she's trying to be polite.::
51970::$$$message_0447_0061_0000$$$::   Now, then...[lr]::
51971::$$$message_0447_0061_0001$$$::I'm happy she's being considerate, but it's going to be hard to make small talk now.::
51972::$$$message_0447_0062_0000$$$::"...Well, fine. She doesn't need to worry about us, though.[lr]::
51973::$$$message_0447_0062_0001$$$::I might as well ask what I need to.[lr]::
51974::$$$message_0447_0062_0002$$$::So, Sakura[line2]how are you? It's been two years. Are you getting along all right?"::
51975::$$$message_0447_0063_0000$$$::"...Yes. It's taken some time, but I'm coming to terms with a lot of things. I know that letting my guilt crush me is the same as running away from it.[lr]::
51976::$$$message_0447_0063_0001$$$::I'm going to do what I can and try my best, bit by bit."::
51977::$$$message_0447_0064_0000$$$::"All right. I looked around earlier, and the town looks completely back to normal. The scars from two years ago are gone, and strange events don't happen anymore.[lr]::
51978::$$$message_0447_0064_0001$$$::...I pushed my responsibilities on you and left for the Association, but maybe it was for the best."::
51979::$$$message_0447_0065_0000$$$::"Yes. It's been difficult filling in for you. But I think it's made me a lot stronger this past year."[lr]::
51980::$$$message_0447_0065_0001$$$::She must mean mentally, not magically.[lr]::
51981::$$$message_0447_0065_0002$$$::Yeah, it's better for people to act than to sit on their worries.::
51982::$$$message_0447_0066_0000$$$::"What about you, Nee-san? It sounds like you've been having some trouble."[lr]::
51983::$$$message_0447_0066_0001$$$::"Me? Uh... Yeah, I guess I am, when you put it that way."::
51984::$$$message_0447_0067_0000$$$::...Where do I even begin?[lr]::
51985::$$$message_0447_0067_0001$$$::Looking back, it all started two years ago.::
51986::$$$message_0447_0068_0000$$$::    The Holy Grail War.[lr]::
51987::$$$message_0447_0068_0001$$$::Two years have passed since he, Sakura, and I got involved in the war.[lr]::
51988::$$$message_0447_0068_0002$$$::The Greater Grail collapsed and the foundation of the Holy Grail War disappeared.[lr]::
51989::$$$message_0447_0068_0003$$$::The quest for the Holy Grail in this land was sealed off, and Fuyuki finally returned to peace.::
51990::$$$message_0447_0069_0000$$$::It did, but not for me.[lr]::
51991::$$$message_0447_0069_0001$$$::The string of incidents happened on mage territory.[lr]::
51992::$$$message_0447_0069_0002$$$::The land of Fuyuki belongs to the Tohsakas, but that's only with the approval of the Association, so it doesn't completely belong to us.[lr]::
51993::$$$message_0447_0069_0003$$$::It's a cardinal rule of the Mage's Association to keep all Mystics hidden, and we shattered it.::
51994::$$$message_0447_0070_0000$$$::First, the collateral damage of the Holy Grail War was enormous.[lr]::
51995::$$$message_0447_0070_0001$$$::Second, the Master sent by the Association was assassinated.[lr]::
51996::$$$message_0447_0070_0002$$$::And to top it off, the Association detected a Swirl of the Root.[lr]::
51997::$$$message_0447_0070_0003$$$::...Well, the first two were Kirei's responsibility, and he was the overseer sent by the Association, so we had that excuse.::
51998::$$$message_0447_0071_0000$$$::But we couldn't do anything about the third problem.[lr]::
51999::$$$message_0447_0071_0001$$$::The Holy Grail caused a gate to appear. Rituals concerning the Root are under the purview of the Mage's Association.::
52000::$$$message_0447_0072_0000$$$::From their point of view, we basically committed a war crime.[lr]::
52001::$$$message_0447_0072_0001$$$::One day, something resembling a Swirl of the Root was suddenly detected in the Far East, and while they were being happy and surprised, it vanished just as suddenly.[lr]::
52002::$$$message_0447_0072_0002$$$::The people in charge were plenty pissed that a gate was opened, but they [font italic=true]really[font italic=false] wanted to tear us a new one for letting it close after it succeeded.::
52003::$$$message_0447_0073_0000$$$::And so, while I was struggling with the mop-up, they brought me to the heart of the Association in London, England.::
52004::$$$message_0447_0074_0000$$$::That's how I stood trial in a meeting room housing about three hundred people.[lr]::
52005::$$$message_0447_0074_0001$$$::They told me how the Lords of each department would come, how stray mages would come to pick up the pieces of the Tohsaka after my sentencing, and so on. Bit of a dog-and-pony show, if you ask me.::
52006::$$$message_0447_0075_0000$$$::"Guess that's it for me. At this rate, my only options are to be a fugitive in the Middle East where they're hostile to the Association, or fight to the bitter end in Japan."::
52007::$$$message_0447_0076_0000$$$::That's what I was ready to do, and when I was readying my escape, I learned that God giveth, just as He taketh away.[lr]::
52008::$$$message_0447_0076_0001$$$::At Rin Tohsaka's indictment hearing...::
52009::$$$message_0447_0077_0000$$$::"...No. I bear responsibility for my disciple's misconduct as well."::
52010::$$$message_0447_0078_0000$$$::An old man just a little more senior than the people in charge showed up for the first time in centuries and cleared me of all charges.::
52011::$$$message_0447_0079_0000$$$::Of course, he didn't take any punishment on my behalf.[lr]::
52012::$$$message_0447_0079_0001$$$::The world of mages operates on equivalent exchange. Give and take.[lr]::
52013::$$$message_0447_0079_0002$$$::And the old man said, of all things...::
52014::$$$message_0447_0080_0000$$$::"Very well. Then I will take apprentices. I can teach up to three students. All departments are to present their candidates after this conference."[lr]::
52015::$$$message_0447_0080_0001$$$::He dropped an utter bombshell.::
52016::$$$message_0447_0081_0000$$$::I mean, a missing Magician appeared and said he would take apprentices![lr]::
52017::$$$message_0447_0081_0001$$$::The conference was in chaos.[lr]::
52018::$$$message_0447_0081_0002$$$::They stopped caring about an insignificant bug like me and went scrambling for days and nights to select candidates. It was a huge commotion.::
52019::$$$message_0447_0082_0000$$$::Then, the old man turned to me while I was standing there awestruck, and...::
52020::$$$message_0447_0082_0001$$$::"I believe 'a kite has given birth to a hawk' is an expression from your country. Tohsaka was my least talented student, but to think you would reach it in a mere six generations..."[lr]::
52021::$$$message_0447_0082_0002$$$::...graced me with that remark.::
52022::$$$message_0447_0083_0000$$$::"W-what do you mean, Grandmaster?"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
52023::$$$message_0447_0083_0001$$$::I asked, timidly.[lr]::
52024::$$$message_0447_0083_0002$$$::After all, I thought he would kill me if he noticed me.[lr]::
52025::$$$message_0447_0083_0003$$$::Magicians don't leak their Magic to other people.[lr]::
52026::$$$message_0447_0083_0004$$$::My instincts told me that they would ruthlessly eliminate those who approach their miracles.::
52027::$$$message_0447_0084_0000$$$::But you should never underestimate your enemy.[lr]::
52028::$$$message_0447_0084_0001$$$::The Gemstone Grandpa patted me on the head and complimented me.::
52029::$$$message_0447_0085_0000$$$::"Take advantage of them. This place is stiff and constrained, but it is well-equipped."[lr]::
52030::$$$message_0447_0085_0001$$$::As expected of the Grandmaster.[lr]::
52031::$$$message_0447_0085_0002$$$::Being someone who travels to all kinds of parallel worlds, he's open-minded.::
52032::$$$message_0447_0086_0000$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
52033::$$$message_0447_0086_0001$$$::To tell the truth, I can recreate the Jeweled Sword.[lr]::
52034::$$$message_0447_0086_0002$$$::I understood the blueprints and the theory during that battle, so if I have enough time and resources, I can make an imitation of Magic.[lr]::
52035::$$$message_0447_0086_0003$$$::Still, I'd need serious funds to pull it off. It's more than I could gather in a year or two[line2]no, a decade or two.::
52036::$$$message_0447_0087_0000$$$::...And that's how I got off scot-free.[lr]::
52037::$$$message_0447_0087_0001$$$::I even got a free ride to the Clock Tower to top it off. After I graduated high school, I made Sakura the administrator of Fuyuki and promptly left for London.::
52038::$$$message_0447_0088_0000$$$::It's been a year since then.[lr]::
52039::$$$message_0447_0088_0001$$$::Life at the Clock Tower has been an ordeal, but like Sakura, I'm [font italic=true]very[font italic=false] slowly expanding my own territory.::
52040::$$$message_0447_0089_0000$$$::"...I see. So, Nee-san. The Emiya house[line2]the matter with Senpai is..."::
52041::$$$message_0447_0090_0000$$$::"...It won't be a problem.[lr]::
52042::$$$message_0447_0090_0001$$$::I haven't reported it, and Kirei only marked him down as a regular civilian casualty. For better or worse, we're the only ones who know about him."::
52043::$$$message_0447_0091_0000$$$::"........."::
52044::$$$message_0447_0092_0000$$$::The mood's a little heavy.[lr]::
52045::$$$message_0447_0092_0001$$$::After the battle...[lr]::
52046::$$$message_0447_0092_0002$$$::I survived, thanks to Rider carrying me and Sakura to the surface.::
52047::$$$message_0447_0093_0000$$$::Rider took me back to the Tohsaka house, where I replenished my magical energy.[lr]::
52048::$$$message_0447_0093_0001$$$::As long as I have magical energy, the Tohsaka Magic Crest will keep me alive whether I like it or not.[lr]::
52049::$$$message_0447_0093_0002$$$::I couldn't eat for a while, but I recovered quickly.::
52050::$$$message_0447_0094_0000$$$::Sakura had to deal with after-effects of being connected to AÅ‹ra Mainiiu. And, well, she was hopeless for a while once he was gone.[lr]::
52051::$$$message_0447_0094_0001$$$::She didn't panic, nor did she brood.[lr]::
52052::$$$message_0447_0094_0002$$$::She kept pretending everything was fine, like he would come home someday.[lr]::
52053::$$$message_0447_0094_0003$$$::To be honest, it would have been easier for me to treat her if she'd snapped instead.::
52054::$$$message_0447_0095_0000$$$::...But it's all in the past now.[lr]::
52055::$$$message_0447_0095_0001$$$::Life has slowly changed over the days and months.[lr]::
52056::$$$message_0447_0095_0002$$$::Sakura graduated and said she'd stay in Fuyuki for a while.[lr]::
52057::$$$message_0447_0095_0003$$$::I'm going to use up all of my vacation time here. I'll have to go back to London in a week.::
52058::$$$message_0447_0096_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
52059::$$$message_0447_0096_0001$$$::...What did I expect when I came back to this house?::
52060::$$$message_0447_0097_0000$$$::For a year...[lr]::
52061::$$$message_0447_0097_0001$$$::No, for two years, so much has happened here.[lr]::
52062::$$$message_0447_0097_0002$$$::My memory goes back a year, but I actually spent a lot of time here before I graduated.[lr]::
52063::$$$message_0447_0097_0003$$$::Is that why?[lr]::
52064::$$$message_0447_0097_0004$$$::Did I think that if I turned to look at the kitchen, he'd be standing there holding a kitchen knife with a bored expression?::
52065::$$$message_0447_0098_0000$$$::...The rookie mage who got caught up in the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
52066::$$$message_0447_0098_0001$$$::He fought to the very end and won. And for his trouble...::
52067::$$$message_0447_0099_0000$$$::"I'm home! Sorry, everyone. Issei asked me to drop some offerings off at a worshipper's house, so I got sidetracked."::
52068::$$$message_0447_0100_0000$$$::...he ended up looking totally fine.::
52069::$$$message_0447_0101_0000$$$::Shirou comes into the living room carrying a veritable mountain of shopping bags.[lr]::
52070::$$$message_0447_0101_0001$$$::Of course...[lr]::
52071::$$$message_0447_0101_0002$$$::...our eyes meet.::
52072::$$$message_0447_0102_0000$$$::"...Hey. Y-you're looking pretty swell."[lr]::
52073::$$$message_0447_0102_0001$$$::Oh no. I'm gonna laugh.[lr]::
52074::$$$message_0447_0102_0002$$$::It's obvious that he took a deep breath in the hallway and is trying his best to play it cool.::
52075::$$$message_0447_0103_0000$$$::"L-long time no see. And you're looking pretty out of it, as always."[lr]::
52076::$$$message_0447_0103_0001$$$::Wait, why am I saying the same thing back to him!?[lr]::
52077::$$$message_0447_0103_0002$$$::Now Sakura's giggling at both of us!::
52078::$$$message_0447_0104_0000$$$::"Senpai, you'll just make Nee-san laugh more if you force yourself to act tough. But she's being just as stubborn, so it's only fair."[lr]::
52079::$$$message_0447_0104_0001$$$::Now she's saying something scary.::
52080::$$$message_0447_0105_0000$$$::"...I'm not forcing anything. Tohsaka's family, so it's perfectly normal for her to be here. It's nothing special."::
52081::$$$message_0447_0106_0000$$$::Still, he came in holding a massive amount of groceries.[lr]::
52082::$$$message_0447_0106_0001$$$::Good grief.[lr]::
52083::$$$message_0447_0106_0002$$$::Why'd you buy so much? We can't finish it all, dummy.::
52084::$$$message_0447_0107_0000$$$::"Yeah, I don't know what I was nervous for. This guy hasn't changed one bit."[lr]::
52085::$$$message_0447_0107_0001$$$::"Yes. Senpai hasn't changed [font italic=true]at all[font italic=false]."::
52086::$$$message_0447_0108_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
52087::$$$message_0447_0108_0001$$$::Oh. He's making that face that says he's got something to say, but decides not to bother.::
52088::$$$message_0447_0109_0000$$$::"Hmph. Sure, whatever... Tohsaka, you're staying over for dinner tonight, right?"[lr]::
52089::$$$message_0447_0109_0001$$$::"Yeah. I'm sleeping over, actually."::
52090::$$$message_0447_0110_0000$$$::"Okay. Then take it easy. You must be tired from your flight. I'll clean up after dinner, so just enjoy tea with Sakura.[lr]::
52091::$$$message_0447_0110_0001$$$::I bet you have a lot to catch up on."::
52092::$$$message_0447_0111_0000$$$::He goes to the kitchen and puts on an apron.[lr]::
52093::$$$message_0447_0111_0001$$$::It's the place he's always been for the last year[line2]no, half year, to be exact. A sight burned into my memory.::
52094::$$$message_0447_0112_0000$$$::"Thanks. I'll take you up on that."[lr]::
52095::$$$message_0447_0112_0001$$$::"Good, good.[lr]::
52096::$$$message_0447_0112_0002$$$::...Oh, and welcome home, Tohsaka. I wasn't worried one bit about you, but I'm glad you haven't changed."[lr]::
52097::$$$message_0447_0112_0003$$$::"It's good to be home, Emiya. I'm happy to see you're the same, too."::
52098::$$$message_0447_0113_0000$$$::Then, the master of the house briskly prepares dinner for a freeloader.[lr]::
52099::$$$message_0447_0113_0001$$$::...Well, then.[lr]::
52100::$$$message_0447_0113_0002$$$::I guess I'll look forward to seeing how much he's recovered in the last year.::
52101::$$$message_0447_0114_0000$$$::"Huh. He looks like he's doing well. For a while, I wasn't sure what would happen, but nobody would be any wiser now. Did everything go okay at school?"[lr]::
52102::$$$message_0447_0114_0001$$$::"Yes. We graduated together, thanks to you."::
52103::$$$message_0447_0115_0000$$$::All right.[lr]::
52104::$$$message_0447_0115_0001$$$::Then I probably don't need to step in anymore.[lr]::
52105::$$$message_0447_0115_0002$$$::...Sakura never needed my help to begin with, but hopefully I was helpful in filing a leave of absence with school and smoothing things over with Ms. Fujimura.::
52106::$$$message_0447_0116_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
52107::$$$message_0447_0116_0001$$$::If you want to know why he's alive, it was only possible through Magic.::
52108::$$$message_0447_0117_0000$$$::Shirou Emiya's body was completely destroyed.[lr]::
52109::$$$message_0447_0117_0001$$$::His Magic Circuits were thoroughly wrecked by Archer's arm invading his body, and Projecting past his limits.[lr]::
52110::$$$message_0447_0117_0002$$$::It was a [font italic=true]death[font italic=false] beyond even the power of the Holy Grail to heal.[lr]::
52111::$$$message_0447_0117_0003$$$::The reason he's so hale and hearty now is because the Shirou standing there is a copy.::
52112::$$$message_0447_0118_0000$$$::Ah, no, that's not accurate, either.[lr]::
52113::$$$message_0447_0118_0001$$$::Shirou's body died.[lr]::
52114::$$$message_0447_0118_0002$$$::That Holy Grail couldn't have resurrected his dead body.[lr]::
52115::$$$message_0447_0118_0003$$$::All the Lesser Grail[line2]all Illya could do was a Mystic called the Third Magic.[lr]::
52116::$$$message_0447_0118_0004$$$::She used that to revive his soul, somehow.[lr]::
52117::$$$message_0447_0118_0005$$$::She brought him back and gave him an undamaged vessel.::
52118::$$$message_0447_0119_0000$$$::You might think that sounds crazy, but that's the Third Magic for you.[lr]::
52119::$$$message_0447_0119_0001$$$::I'm not talking about transferring a spiritual body or a mind alone into someone else's brain and controlling it.[lr]::
52120::$$$message_0447_0119_0002$$$::When a soul materialized by the Third Magic gains a body with human functions, it can completely remake it [font italic=true]in the soul's image[font italic=false].[lr]::
52121::$$$message_0447_0119_0003$$$::Not the DNA of the flesh, but of the soul, apparently.[lr]::
52122::$$$message_0447_0119_0004$$$::Illya resurrected Shirou Emiya by reviving his soul and placing it in a raw body that hadn't become anything yet.::
52123::$$$message_0447_0120_0000$$$::...But it was an incomplete body, so Illya's Third Magic wasn't on the same level as the original, I think.[lr]::
52124::$$$message_0447_0120_0001$$$::A few days after the cavern collapsed, Rider found Shirou looking a [font italic=true]liiiittle[font italic=false] bit different than he used to.[lr]::
52125::$$$message_0447_0120_0002$$$::...Okay, she didn't find him so much as she plucked or maybe pinched him from the rubble.::
52126::$$$message_0447_0121_0000$$$::It was a shock at first, to be sure, and it left me wondering how it was even possible.[lr]::
52127::$$$message_0447_0121_0001$$$::But when I think about it, when Shirou's cooking in the kitchen, he's being remote-controlled by his [font italic=true]living soul[font italic=false], allowing him to interact with our world.::
52128::$$$message_0447_0122_0000$$$::Things like memories, the brain, and Magic Circuits actually aren't located in the body, but the soul.[lr]::
52129::$$$message_0447_0122_0001$$$::Meaning that the vessel is no more than a motor function terminal, while the control system sits safely untouchable on the other side.::
52130::$$$message_0447_0123_0000$$$::...Still, the first six months were repeated trial and error.[lr]::
52131::$$$message_0447_0123_0001$$$::He isn't a plant that'll grow if you water it, nor are there any blueprints for him like a homunculus would have.[lr]::
52132::$$$message_0447_0123_0002$$$::In the end, we sold the entire Matou library to the Association and bought a body that a renowned puppet master had left behind, getting him to where he is now.::
52133::$$$message_0447_0124_0000$$$::...I hope this doesn't give you the wrong idea. Shirou's just as human as we are.[lr]::
52134::$$$message_0447_0124_0001$$$::He can get surgery at the hospital, medication works on him, and he'll die if he's killed.[lr]::
52135::$$$message_0447_0124_0002$$$::When a body is imbued with a soul, it enters a fixed state in exchange for recreating that soul.::
52136::$$$message_0447_0125_0000$$$::In other words, he's like a Servant that can operate without a Master.[lr]::
52137::$$$message_0447_0125_0001$$$::The only difference is that he's living in this era.[lr]::
52138::$$$message_0447_0125_0002$$$::He'll grow, he'll go to Heaven when he dies, and he'll make us delicious food. he's the same Shirou Emiya I've always known.::
52139::$$$message_0447_0126_0000$$$::"Still, it was used goods. I hit up some other skilled puppeteers, but none of them had any bodies as good as this one.[lr]::
52140::$$$message_0447_0126_0001$$$::I wanted to commission the creator directly, but she's on the run from the Association after getting a Seal Designation. It'll be a pain to track her down."::
52141::$$$message_0447_0127_0000$$$::"Really? Senpai says he's fine as he is, though. His magical energy circulation isn't good, but everything else is better than before.[lr]::
52142::$$$message_0447_0127_0001$$$::...Um, I think so, too."::
52143::$$$message_0447_0128_0000$$$::Mm-hm...[lr]::
52144::$$$message_0447_0128_0001$$$::No matter how good the body is, it'll be overwritten by its soul, so there might be parts that don't work as well. I don't think it would [font italic=true]exceed[font italic=false] the original's performance, though...[lr]::
52145::$$$message_0447_0128_0002$$$::"Hey, wait."[lr]::
52146::$$$message_0447_0128_0003$$$::What's Sakura blushing for?::
52147::$$$message_0447_0129_0000$$$::"Sakura?"[lr]::
52148::$$$message_0447_0129_0001$$$::"U-um...you see... I thought that maybe I was overdoing it, but my body is still, um..."[lr]::
52149::$$$message_0447_0129_0002$$$::"Oh..."::
52150::$$$message_0447_0130_0000$$$::...[font italic=true]That's[font italic=false] what she meant.[lr]::
52151::$$$message_0447_0130_0001$$$::I heard that Sakura's body is still feeling the after-effects of AÅ‹ra Mainiiu.[lr]::
52152::$$$message_0447_0130_0002$$$::She may have severed her contract with AÅ‹ra Mainiiu, but she's still a Holy Grail.[lr]::
52153::$$$message_0447_0130_0003$$$::In fact, she's still connected to the other side.[lr]::
52154::$$$message_0447_0130_0004$$$::That enormous magical energy floods Sakura's body, so she needs to vent it every once in a while to maintain her body.::
52155::$$$message_0447_0131_0000$$$::Without the Greater Grail, Rider can remain in the world thanks to Sakura's magical energy.[lr]::
52156::$$$message_0447_0131_0001$$$::But that still isn't enough to use it up, so she must be giving the excess to Shirou.[lr]::
52157::$$$message_0447_0131_0002$$$::Shirou's current body has few Magic Circuits. It's true that without Sakura's help, it might start to revert.::
52158::$$$message_0447_0132_0000$$$::"...Haaah. You two are really going at it, huh?"[lr]::
52159::$$$message_0447_0132_0001$$$::"Yes. It's been challenging."[lr]::
52160::$$$message_0447_0132_0002$$$::   Although I'm sure it poses a lot of problems to living a normal life, Sakura's constitution gives her a huge advantage as a mage.::
52161::$$$message_0447_0133_0000$$$::"...Wait. If you think about it, we're a pretty impressive party."[lr]::
52162::$$$message_0447_0133_0001$$$::Shirou is a successful case of the Third Magic who will be able to master his Reality Marble with the proper training.[lr]::
52163::$$$message_0447_0133_0002$$$::Sakura can use a portion of the Holy Grail's powers.[lr]::
52164::$$$message_0447_0133_0003$$$::Rider's just plain cheating.[lr]::
52165::$$$message_0447_0133_0004$$$::And I can more or less imitate the Second Magic.::
52166::$$$message_0447_0134_0000$$$::"............"[lr]::
52167::$$$message_0447_0134_0001$$$::To be blunt, we're invincible.[lr]::
52168::$$$message_0447_0134_0002$$$::I want someone to start a Mage's Association Tournament.[lr]::
52169::$$$message_0447_0134_0003$$$::Do you think there would be prize money if we swooped in and took first place? An easy five hundred thousand. Pounds, of course. I'm Japanese, so no tax, please.::
52170::$$$message_0447_0135_0000$$$::"Mrgh."[lr]::
52171::$$$message_0447_0135_0001$$$::Crap. I'm actually considering it.[lr]::
52172::$$$message_0447_0135_0002$$$::Then I'll be truly free and all of my dreams will come true.[lr]::
52173::$$$message_0447_0135_0003$$$::I'll use the funds to reforge the Jeweled Sword, say goodbye to that dreary place, and come back to this town.[lr]::
52174::$$$message_0447_0135_0004$$$::Then, I'll be able to do this again...::
52175::$$$message_0447_0136_0000$$$::"...Guess not. It's best to earn an honest living."[lr]::
52176::$$$message_0447_0136_0001$$$::I give up on the idea completely.[lr]::
52177::$$$message_0447_0136_0002$$$::It sounds too easy, to be honest.[lr]::
52178::$$$message_0447_0136_0003$$$::I like my current life, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it changes.[lr]::
52179::$$$message_0447_0136_0004$$$::Besides, I can't stay away forever.[lr]::
52180::$$$message_0447_0136_0005$$$::I couldn't possibly live a peaceful life in this small, peaceful town with all these potential troublemakers around.::
52181::$$$message_0447_0137_0000$$$::"Nee-san? You're making a rather wicked smile..."[lr]::
52182::$$$message_0447_0137_0001$$$::"Oh, am I? You've got sharp senses, Sakura."::
52183::$$$message_0447_0138_0000$$$::I stand up from my seat cushion.[lr]::
52184::$$$message_0447_0138_0001$$$::This is no time to laze around.[lr]::
52185::$$$message_0447_0138_0002$$$::I'm only here for seven days. I'm not going to waste an important meal.::
52186::$$$message_0447_0139_0000$$$::"Shirou, I'm going to help, so let me use the stove. I'll show you the skills I picked up in England."[lr]::
52187::$$$message_0447_0139_0001$$$::I shoot down his objections.[lr]::
52188::$$$message_0447_0139_0002$$$::I start to grin, fantasizing about stealing the show entirely, and put on the apron they keep ready for me.::
52189::$$$message_0447_0140_0000$$$::"Let's see..."[lr]::
52190::$$$message_0447_0140_0001$$$::I roll my sleeves and go to the kitchen.[lr]::
52191::$$$message_0447_0140_0002$$$::But before that...[lr]::
52192::$$$message_0447_0140_0003$$$::I remember what I wanted to confirm the most when I came back home.::
52193::$$$message_0447_0141_0000$$$::It's been two years.[lr]::
52194::$$$message_0447_0141_0001$$$::I turn to my gentle, grown-up sister.[lr]::
52195::$$$message_0447_0141_0002$$$::"Are you happy, Sakura?"[lr]::
52196::$$$message_0447_0141_0003$$$::"...Yes."[lr]::
52197::$$$message_0447_0141_0004$$$::Her full-faced smile is perfect in every way.[lr]::
52198::$$$message_0447_0141_0005$$$::That alone makes coming home worth it.::
52199::$$$message_0447_0142_0000$$$::And so, I share in some of her happiness and look up at the blue sky.::
52200::$$$message_0447_0143_0000$$$::One day, winter ended, and spring came.[lr]::
52201::$$$message_0447_0143_0001$$$::I notice that cherry blossoms cover everything outside, leaving no vestiges of those cold days.[lr]::
52202::$$$message_0447_0143_0002$$$::We've gained enough to balance out what we lost, and settled our accounts.::
52203::$$$message_0447_0144_0000$$$::So...[lr]::
52204::$$$message_0447_0144_0001$$$::Our story in this town is over, but our story is just beginning.[lr]::
52205::$$$message_0447_0144_0002$$$::The credits will roll in the far, far future.[lr]::
52206::$$$message_0447_0144_0003$$$::For now, tomorrow's weather looks good, and my break has just begun.[lr]::
52207::$$$message_0447_0144_0004$$$::Let's embrace a new day, and a new future.::
52208::$$$message_0447_0145_0000$$$::In my mind, I see a vision of ourselves leisurely walking down the hill.::
52209::$$$message_0447_0146_0000$$$::Now...[lr]::
52210::$$$message_0447_0146_0001$$$::Let's go see the flowers this year, just like we promised.::
