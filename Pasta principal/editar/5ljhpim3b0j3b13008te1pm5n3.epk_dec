35581::$$$message_0290_0000_0001$$$::Then, with my free left arm, I should call for the one who can beat her.[lr]::
35582::$$$message_0290_0000_0002$$$::I don't even know how to consciously use it.[lr]::
35583::$$$message_0290_0000_0003$$$::But it responded once before, so if I really put my mind to it...!::
35584::$$$message_0290_0001_0000$$$::"Ungh... PLEASE COME, SABER...!"[lr]::
35585::$$$message_0290_0001_0001$$$::My field of vision is covered in light.[lr]::
35586::$$$message_0290_0001_0002$$$::It might be because I used the Command Spell, but I feel an intense pain in my left hand.[lr]::

35588::$$$message_0290_0001_0004$$$::I hear a fleshy noise followed by the sound of blood splattering. Pain again shoots through my hand.::
35589::$$$message_0290_0002_0000$$$::"...Haah..."[lr]::
35590::$$$message_0290_0002_0001$$$::When I open my eyes...[lr]::
35591::$$$message_0290_0002_0002$$$::"Aaaaaaahhhhhh....!!!???"[lr]::
35592::$$$message_0290_0002_0003$$$::The Command Spell fades from...my...hand...::

35594::$$$message_0290_0003_0001$$$::An involuntary howl escapes my throat.[lr]::
35595::$$$message_0290_0003_0002$$$::Just as I lose command of my voice, the pain in my limb spikes beyond my control.::
35596::$$$message_0290_0004_0000$$$::"...Ah, yes, congratulations. You were bound to use your Command Spell if I kept your left hand free.[lr]::
35597::$$$message_0290_0004_0001$$$::You were babbling nonsense earlier, but you are no different from other Masters when cornered. You're just a human who binds a Servant with that curse."::
35598::$$$message_0290_0005_0000$$$::"Ungh... Hnng, ah, hah...!"[lr]::
35599::$$$message_0290_0005_0001$$$::...It won't stop.[lr]::
35600::$$$message_0290_0005_0002$$$::The blood gushing from my left arm won't stop.[lr]::
35601::$$$message_0290_0005_0003$$$::With a wound this big, it'll never stop...!::
35602::$$$message_0290_0006_0000$$$::"To make you use your Command Spell... In this hunt, I have fulfilled the condition that I set for myself.[lr]::
35603::$$$message_0290_0006_0001$$$::And the other would be to gouge your eyes out... But I shall spare you from that. I am more than satisfied just from hearing your cries of anguish. I will surely find the peak of my delight if I gouge your eyes out as well."::
35604::$$$message_0290_0007_0000$$$::"Ha... Ah, ah, ha..."[lr]::
35605::$$$message_0290_0007_0001$$$::    The bleeding...won't stop.[lr]::
35606::$$$message_0290_0007_0002$$$::My consciousness fades.[lr]::
35607::$$$message_0290_0007_0003$$$::Before that, before I really die... I have to call for Saber... With my Command Spell...::
35608::$$$message_0290_0008_0000$$$::"That is enough bleeding. Originally, I was going to gouge your chest out and end your life, but I shall hold back in honor of the fact that you put up a good fight.[lr]::
35609::$$$message_0290_0008_0001$$$::Archer's Master should arrive soon. You may survive if you are lucky... But your brain will likely not be able to function normally even if you do."::

35611::$$$message_0290_0010_0000$$$::I don't feel any pain.[lr]::
