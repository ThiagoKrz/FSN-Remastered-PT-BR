52211::$$$message_0448_0000_0000$$$::And then, I wake up.[lr]::
52212::$$$message_0448_0000_0001$$$::I don't feel tired. My mind and body are refreshed, like they belong to someone else.::
52213::$$$message_0448_0001_0000$$$::"...Huh, Senpai?"[lr]::
52214::$$$message_0448_0001_0001$$$::He was supposed to be sleeping next to me, but nobody else is in my futon.[lr]::
52215::$$$message_0448_0001_0002$$$::I look at the clock and see that it's already ten o'clock in the morning.[lr]::
52216::$$$message_0448_0001_0003$$$::"Oh, he went to make breakfast."[lr]::
52217::$$$message_0448_0001_0004$$$::I pretend to accept that and get up.::
52218::$$$message_0448_0002_0000$$$::I'm surprised by my lightness.[lr]::
52219::$$$message_0448_0002_0001$$$::What's going on, I wonder.[lr]::
52220::$$$message_0448_0002_0002$$$::It's as if my arms and legs have been freed from a lifetime of chains.::
52221::$$$message_0448_0003_0000$$$::"Ah... Um, right."[lr]::
52222::$$$message_0448_0003_0001$$$::I remember, and my body heats up.[lr]::
52223::$$$message_0448_0003_0002$$$::Last night, Senpai shared his blood with me, and we slept together.[lr]::
52224::$$$message_0448_0003_0003$$$::...When we came back from the forest, Senpai only had one arm, but we were sure things would work out.[lr]::
52225::$$$message_0448_0003_0004$$$::I'm feeling fine, so I can ask Rider to help out.::
52226::$$$message_0448_0004_0000$$$::Nothing bad will happen aymore.[lr]::
52227::$$$message_0448_0004_0001$$$::I have Senpai and Nee-san. We'll all do great, and...::
52228::$$$message_0448_0005_0000$$$::"Ah...ngh."[lr]::
52229::$$$message_0448_0005_0001$$$::...A nightmare.[lr]::
52230::$$$message_0448_0005_0002$$$::Why do I dream about the worst events?::
52231::$$$message_0448_0006_0000$$$::"Senpai?"[lr]::
52232::$$$message_0448_0006_0001$$$::The breeze coming in feels nice.[lr]::
52233::$$$message_0448_0006_0002$$$::The corridor is bathed in light, and walking through it lifts my spirits.[lr]::
52234::$$$message_0448_0006_0003$$$::My body feels so light.[lr]::
52235::$$$message_0448_0006_0004$$$::Maybe I even lost weight while I was asleep.::
52236::$$$message_0448_0007_0000$$$::...To be honest, I'm a little on the heavy side, and I do battle with the bathroom scale every night.[lr]::
52237::$$$message_0448_0007_0001$$$::It hasn't really been working, but if Senpai says something like,[lr]::
52238::$$$message_0448_0007_0002$$$::"Sakura, you look slender in everything, huh?"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
52239::$$$message_0448_0007_0003$$$::It'll make me swoon, so I'm certainly in favor of this newfound weight loss.::
52240::$$$message_0448_0008_0000$$$::"Senpai...?"[lr]::
52241::$$$message_0448_0008_0001$$$::My body really feels so light and relaxed, it feels like the world is changing with each step I take.::
52242::$$$message_0448_0009_0000$$$::    My body is so light.[lr]::
52243::$$$message_0448_0009_0001$$$::    The air is so beautiful.[lr]::
52244::$$$message_0448_0009_0002$$$::    The pulsing is so warm.::
52245::$$$message_0448_0010_0000$$$::It's like I've been freed from a poison permeating my body.[lr]::
52246::$$$message_0448_0010_0001$$$::Like the worms Grandfather implanted in me,[lr]::
52247::$$$message_0448_0010_0002$$$::like the black mud sticking to my heart,[lr]::
52248::$$$message_0448_0010_0003$$$::like the awful dreams lingering in the back of my mind never happened at all...::
52249::$$$message_0448_0011_0000$$$::"Hey, Senpai?"[lr]::
52250::$$$message_0448_0011_0001$$$::Nobody's here.[lr]::
52251::$$$message_0448_0011_0002$$$::The hallway is very quiet.::
52252::$$$message_0448_0012_0000$$$::"Senpai... Senpai...?"[lr]::
52253::$$$message_0448_0012_0001$$$::Nobody's here.[lr]::
52254::$$$message_0448_0012_0002$$$::The sunshine is warm.::
52255::$$$message_0448_0013_0000$$$::"Senpai... Sen...pai...? Oh, are we playing hide and seek?"[lr]::
52256::$$$message_0448_0013_0001$$$::Nobody's here.[lr]::
52257::$$$message_0448_0013_0002$$$::The air is crisp.::
52258::$$$message_0448_0014_0000$$$::"Huh... That's...weird. Wha... Senpai is just hiding...but..."[lr]::
52259::$$$message_0448_0014_0001$$$::That can't be right.[lr]::
52260::$$$message_0448_0014_0002$$$::Somebody has to be here.[lr]::
52261::$$$message_0448_0014_0003$$$::It was just a bad dream,::
52262::$$$message_0448_0015_0000$$$::    but I saw someone at the end.[lr]::
52263::$$$message_0448_0015_0001$$$::    His body was totally broken, and they would never meet again[line2]::
52264::$$$message_0448_0016_0000$$$::"No... It, it isn't true, right, Senpai?"[lr]::
52265::$$$message_0448_0016_0001$$$::Of course it isn't true.[lr]::
52266::$$$message_0448_0016_0002$$$::His body wasn't human anymore.[lr]::
52267::$$$message_0448_0016_0003$$$::He couldn't possibly move in that body, so he should be staying here, waiting somewhere for me to come[line2]::
52268::$$$message_0448_0017_0000$$$::"Senpai... Sen...pai."[lr]::
52269::$$$message_0448_0017_0001$$$::But...[lr]::
52270::$$$message_0448_0017_0002$$$::The calendar in the living room shows that it's already been over ten days. It's the end of February.::
52271::$$$message_0448_0018_0000$$$::"Ah... No..."[lr]::
52272::$$$message_0448_0018_0001$$$::I collapse to my knees.[lr]::
52273::$$$message_0448_0018_0002$$$::I understand everything now.[lr]::
52274::$$$message_0448_0018_0003$$$::No, I knew as soon I woke up, but I pretended not to.::
52275::$$$message_0448_0019_0000$$$::"No... Come out, please come out, Senpai...![lr]::
52276::$$$message_0448_0019_0001$$$::I... I can't... I can't do this by myself, Senpai. I can't go on without you, Senpai. Senpai, Senpai, Senpaiii...!!!"::
52277::$$$message_0448_0020_0000$$$::My personality goes blank.[lr]::
52278::$$$message_0448_0020_0001$$$::Even now, I'm about to collapse but can't collapse. I can only weep.[lr]::
52279::$$$message_0448_0020_0002$$$::That's really all it is.[lr]::
52280::$$$message_0448_0020_0003$$$::I'm a weakling, a crybaby, I don't know any other way to atone, and I can't even be grateful for being alive.::
52281::$$$message_0448_0021_0000$$$::It's the end of a long winter.[lr]::
52282::$$$message_0448_0021_0001$$$::I've been freed from the chains binding me for the last eleven years, but I lost my only guidepost.::
52283::$$$message_0448_0022_0000$$$::"...Haah. You're so stubborn, Sakura. I underestimated you."[lr]::
52284::$$$message_0448_0022_0001$$$::The boy speaks sullenly.[lr]::
52285::$$$message_0448_0022_0002$$$::He sighs with a frustrated expression.[lr]::
52286::$$$message_0448_0022_0003$$$::...She was prepared for that.[lr]::
52287::$$$message_0448_0022_0004$$$::She made contact with him, assuming that he would dislike her and that she would cause him trouble.::
52288::$$$message_0448_0023_0000$$$::It was but a slight touch.[lr]::
52289::$$$message_0448_0023_0001$$$::A part of her thought it would hurt if the boy disliked her, while...[lr]::
52290::$$$message_0448_0023_0002$$$::"Oh, start over from this part. I'm going to be counting on you, so you can't ask me for help.[lr]::
52291::$$$message_0448_0023_0003$$$::[line3]Thanks, Sakura. I'll have you help me until my injury gets better.[lr]::
52292::$$$message_0448_0023_0004$$$::She saw how the boy muttered it to hide his embarrassment, and she cherished his generosity of spirit.::
52293::$$$message_0448_0024_0000$$$::Spring comes.::
52294::$$$message_0448_0025_0000$$$::"...Whew. That settles one thing, Sakura.[lr]::
52295::$$$message_0448_0025_0001$$$::The Association's investigation is over, and Kirei's replacement seems decent. They're not going to punish us.[lr]::
52296::$$$message_0448_0025_0002$$$::This is a happy ending, right?"::
52297::$$$message_0448_0026_0000$$$::Nee-san is strong.[lr]::
52298::$$$message_0448_0026_0001$$$::She wasn't any more energetic than I was, but her spirits lifted when spring came, and she's working her brain.::
52299::$$$message_0448_0027_0000$$$::"By the way, Sakura, want to come live at my house? If you're moving out of the Matou house, it'd be easier for you to come over, right?"::
52300::$$$message_0448_0028_0000$$$::Nee-san's consideration is so kind.[lr]::
52301::$$$message_0448_0028_0001$$$::I've dreamed for years about living in the Tohsaka house with my sister.[lr]::
52302::$$$message_0448_0028_0002$$$::I can't stand being alone at night, and even today, I'm not sure what will happen if she comes home.[lr]::
52303::$$$message_0448_0028_0003$$$::But...[lr]::
52304::$$$message_0448_0028_0004$$$::That's why I need to grow up.::
52305::$$$message_0448_0029_0000$$$::"...I see. You're going to strike out on your own. Then I won't pressure you. I'll be around until I graduate, so feel free to come hang out on your days off."::
52306::$$$message_0448_0030_0000$$$::She tells me she'll be waiting, and leaves.[lr]::
52307::$$$message_0448_0030_0001$$$::...It must have been stuck in her hair when she came here.[lr]::
52308::$$$message_0448_0030_0002$$$::A pink flower petal flutters through the air.::
52309::$$$message_0448_0031_0000$$$::"Hm? Is this your first time cooking, Sakura?"[lr]::
52310::$$$message_0448_0031_0001$$$::It wasn't, but I can't say I was familiar with it yet.[lr]::
52311::$$$message_0448_0031_0002$$$::I did my best to read a lot of books before I came, and I was about average in cooking class.[lr]::
52312::$$$message_0448_0031_0003$$$::To tell the truth, though, I was very, very afraid to have anyone eat something I cooked.::
52313::$$$message_0448_0032_0000$$$::"...No. I can make simple things."[lr]::
52314::$$$message_0448_0032_0001$$$::"That's not what I meant, um... well, you'll just learn as you go.[lr]::
52315::$$$message_0448_0032_0002$$$::Okay, I'll start from the basics. Here. Careful, it's hot."::
52316::$$$message_0448_0033_0000$$$::The basic dish was rice balls.[lr]::
52317::$$$message_0448_0033_0001$$$::We took steaming hot rice and squeezed it together.[lr]::
52318::$$$message_0448_0033_0002$$$::I thought he was making fun of me.[lr]::
52319::$$$message_0448_0033_0003$$$::I sulked a little, thinking that it was beneath me.[lr]::
52320::$$$message_0448_0033_0004$$$::But when I looked up, I saw that his face was deadly serious, and I couldn't feel upset.[lr]::
52321::$$$message_0448_0033_0005$$$::And then...::
52322::$$$message_0448_0034_0000$$$::"Okay, let's trade. I'll give you my rice ball, and I'll eat yours."[lr]::
52323::$$$message_0448_0034_0001$$$::He took the rice ball I just made and stuffed his cheeks with it, right in front of me.[lr]::
52324::$$$message_0448_0034_0002$$$::He gobbled up something [font italic=true]I[font italic=false] made and put his hands together in thanks.::
52325::$$$message_0448_0035_0000$$$::I don't know what he was trying to tell me.[lr]::
52326::$$$message_0448_0035_0001$$$::But the next day, I didn't feel as self-conscious about my cooking, and I wanted him to eat it and thank me again.::
52327::$$$message_0448_0036_0000$$$::Spring comes.::
52328::$$$message_0448_0037_0000$$$::"...Are you sure, Sakura? It would help us out a lot if you took over, but..."::
52329::$$$message_0448_0038_0000$$$::I earned a surprising amount of money from selling the Matou house.[lr]::
52330::$$$message_0448_0038_0001$$$::It's more than enough to maintain this one.[lr]::
52331::$$$message_0448_0038_0002$$$::I asked Ms. Fujimura's grandfather to give me the deed to the property, and decided to keep this place the way it is, no matter what happens from now on.::
52332::$$$message_0448_0039_0000$$$::"...I'm happy you care so much.[lr]::
52333::$$$message_0448_0039_0001$$$::Look, Sakura. Shirou isn't coming[line2]"::
52334::$$$message_0448_0040_0000$$$::I shake my head.[lr]::
52335::$$$message_0448_0040_0001$$$::Ms. Fujimura's shoulders droop in resignation.[lr]::
52336::$$$message_0448_0040_0002$$$::"All right. I'll leave this house to you."[lr]::
52337::$$$message_0448_0040_0003$$$::She smiled like a mother, and left the Emiya house.::
52338::$$$message_0448_0041_0000$$$::This...is kind of a tough memory for me.::
52339::$$$message_0448_0042_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"...Sakura. Once this commotion is over, let's go someplace far away.[font italic=false][lr]::
52340::$$$message_0448_0042_0001$$$::[font italic=true]You've never taken a vacation anywhere, have you? It could be fun to go on a trip."[font italic=false]::
52341::$$$message_0448_0043_0000$$$::He said that there was nowhere we couldn't go if we put our minds to it.[lr]::
52342::$$$message_0448_0043_0001$$$::It was so pure that I laughed.::
52343::$$$message_0448_0044_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"...Okay, it's a promise. Once you get better and this is all over..."[font italic=false]::
52344::$$$message_0448_0045_0000$$$::Oh... That...promise.::
52345::$$$message_0448_0046_0000$$$::Spring comes.[lr]::
52346::$$$message_0448_0046_0001$$$::I think I haven't met anyone for a while.::
52347::$$$message_0448_0047_0000$$$::It's difficult being alone.[lr]::
52348::$$$message_0448_0047_0001$$$::I keep repeating my memories. I want to turn them off like a light switch.[lr]::
52349::$$$message_0448_0047_0002$$$::It helps that I don't long for company, but then why did I...::
52350::$$$message_0448_0048_0000$$$::[line3][font italic=true]...Of course I am. You need to take responsibility for what you've done, Sakura.[font italic=false][line3]::
52351::$$$message_0448_0049_0000$$$::...Ahh, I need to do something.[lr]::
52352::$$$message_0448_0049_0001$$$::It's hard being alone and with other people, but I... I need to do what I can...::
52353::$$$message_0448_0050_0000$$$::But I don't know how to atone.[lr]::
52354::$$$message_0448_0050_0001$$$::After all this time, I can't think of a way to help anyone else.[lr]::
52355::$$$message_0448_0050_0002$$$::Because this is for myself.[lr]::
52356::$$$message_0448_0050_0003$$$::I've been growing one flower every year, for that promised day.::
52357::$$$message_0448_0051_0000$$$::Spring comes.::
52358::$$$message_0448_0052_0000$$$::I'm used to being alone. I can enjoy myself a little when people are around.[lr]::
52359::$$$message_0448_0052_0001$$$::But the fear is still there.[lr]::
52360::$$$message_0448_0052_0002$$$::I talk to people, but I feel like the world is demanding that I atone.::
52361::$$$message_0448_0053_0000$$$::[line3][font italic=true]But I'll protect you. I'll protect you from everything people will ask you. Even if it's hypocritical, I've always tried to live up to the ideal of protecting the people I love.[font italic=false][line3]::
52362::$$$message_0448_0054_0000$$$::He was so selfish.[lr]::
52363::$$$message_0448_0054_0001$$$::It was so nasty of him to say all that and then not protect me.[lr]::
52364::$$$message_0448_0054_0002$$$::So I can't forgive him so easily.[lr]::
52365::$$$message_0448_0054_0003$$$::I'm going to be really selfish and make him go through the trouble I had to many times over.::
52366::$$$message_0448_0055_0000$$$::Mm... But I think I'll forgive him anyway.[lr]::
52367::$$$message_0448_0055_0001$$$::It might be hypocritical, but his words calm my heart so much.[lr]::
52368::$$$message_0448_0055_0002$$$::It might be irresponsible, but I love the boy who said that to me, and he loves me, too.::
52369::$$$message_0448_0056_0000$$$::Spring comes.::
52370::$$$message_0448_0057_0000$$$::Spring comes.::
52371::$$$message_0448_0058_0000$$$::Spring comes.::
52372::$$$message_0448_0059_0000$$$::Spring comes.::
52373::$$$message_0448_0060_0000$$$::No one comes to visit.::
52374::$$$message_0448_0061_0000$$$::I'm not sad about it.[lr]::
52375::$$$message_0448_0061_0001$$$::But sometimes, I feel so calm waiting for spring to come that I wonder if I'm still sane.::
52376::$$$message_0448_0062_0000$$$::I'm not sad because something is absolute.[lr]::
52377::$$$message_0448_0062_0001$$$::Because I believe that something will happen that makes up for the suffering.[lr]::
52378::$$$message_0448_0062_0002$$$::I only have one worry.::
52379::$$$message_0448_0063_0000$$$::"...Senpai sure is taking a while. I'm going to be an old woman, at this rate."::
52380::$$$message_0448_0064_0000$$$::I pray that I can stay healthy until that day comes.::
52381::$$$message_0448_0065_0000$$$::Spring comes.[lr]::
52382::$$$message_0448_0065_0001$$$::Lately, I haven't been able to move my body as well as I'd like.[lr]::
52383::$$$message_0448_0065_0002$$$::I go out to water the garden as usual.::
52384::$$$message_0448_0066_0000$$$::"Sensei! I'm here to help!"[lr]::
52385::$$$message_0448_0066_0001$$$::My student is here.[lr]::
52386::$$$message_0448_0066_0002$$$::I'm self-taught and not very skilled, but I found a student willing to learn from me.[lr]::
52387::$$$message_0448_0066_0003$$$::The new Tohsaka heir is a good girl. She's very similar to my sister.::
52388::$$$message_0448_0067_0000$$$::Light scatters.[lr]::
52389::$$$message_0448_0067_0001$$$::I sit in my rocking chair in its usual place, and gaze out at the yard.::
52390::$$$message_0448_0068_0000$$$::"Oh, Sensei. Please don't sleep, okay? I want to hear more stories when I finish."::
52391::$$$message_0448_0069_0000$$$::That brings me great joy.[lr]::
