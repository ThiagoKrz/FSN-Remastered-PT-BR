43715::$$$message_0389_0000_0000$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
43716::$$$message_0389_0000_0001$$$::Caster's regained her consciousness.[lr]::
43717::$$$message_0389_0000_0002$$$::With Kuzuki by her side, she extends her awareness to the entire church.::
43718::$$$message_0389_0001_0000$$$::...It was all for naught.[lr]::
43719::$$$message_0389_0001_0001$$$::Ambushes won't work on Caster anymore.[lr]::
43720::$$$message_0389_0001_0002$$$::Tohsaka barely has any strength left, and I only have two swords left.[lr]::
43721::$$$message_0389_0001_0003$$$::...This is bad.[lr]::
43722::$$$message_0389_0001_0004$$$::If they use "her" to attack us in this state, we won't able to see the light of day ever again...::
43723::$$$message_0389_0002_0000$$$::"...That was close. I have to offer you my thanks, Master. If it wasn't for you, I would've been defeated right there and then."[lr]::
43724::$$$message_0389_0002_0001$$$::"Save it. Wake Saber up now. It seems they're not ones who should be underestimated."[lr]::
43725::$$$message_0389_0002_0002$$$::"Quite the keen observation, Master."[lr]::
43726::$$$message_0389_0002_0003$$$::Caster raises her hand and points at "her" on the altar.::
43727::$$$message_0389_0003_0000$$$::"She" is visibly bound by magical curses.[lr]::
43728::$$$message_0389_0003_0001$$$::Just as Caster is about to set "her" free...::
43729::$$$message_0389_0004_0000$$$::"...Right. You know, had you done that just a few seconds faster."::
43730::$$$message_0389_0005_0000$$$::The sound came from above.[lr]::
43731::$$$message_0389_0005_0001$$$::I can hear the whisper coming from the stairs above me.::
43732::$$$message_0389_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43733::$$$message_0389_0006_0001$$$::Caster was the first one that noticed something was wrong.[lr]::
43734::$$$message_0389_0006_0002$$$::Kuzuki can't tell.[lr]::
43735::$$$message_0389_0006_0003$$$::Why? Because Kuzuki can't detect traces of magical energy.::
43736::$$$message_0389_0007_0000$$$::Caster is on the move.[lr]::
43737::$$$message_0389_0007_0001$$$::Countless amount of swords can be seen...[lr]::
43738::$$$message_0389_0007_0002$$$::Floating above Caster's Master...[lr]::
43739::$$$message_0389_0007_0003$$$::Above Souichirou Kuzuki.::
43740::$$$message_0389_0007_0004$$$::"Souichirou!"[lr]::
43741::$$$message_0389_0007_0005$$$::Perhaps Caster understood that she wouldn't be able to block the attack.[lr]::
43742::$$$message_0389_0007_0006$$$::She now stands in front of her Master trying to shield him from the assault.::
43743::$$$message_0389_0008_0000$$$::                                                  "...Trace, on."::
43744::$$$message_0389_0009_0000$$$::I was certain...that the voice above me uttered such words.::
43745::$$$message_0389_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43746::$$$message_0389_0010_0001$$$::The room is now silent.[lr]::
43747::$$$message_0389_0010_0002$$$::The floating swords turned their gaze upon a single target on the floor and rained down upon them, piercing them.[lr]::
43748::$$$message_0389_0010_0003$$$::The swords vanish after they have cut through flesh and bone,::
43749::$$$message_0389_0011_0000$$$::leaving behind only traces of crimson.[lr]::
43750::$$$message_0389_0011_0001$$$::"Hah...ugh...ah..."[lr]::
43751::$$$message_0389_0011_0002$$$::She chose to be a shield.[lr]::
43752::$$$message_0389_0011_0003$$$::Dragging her bloodied body, the woman looks back to the man she tried to protect.::
43753::$$$message_0389_0012_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
43754::$$$message_0389_0012_0001$$$::Kuzuki says nothing.[lr]::
43755::$$$message_0389_0012_0002$$$::While his Servant stands in front of him with countless piercing wounds.[lr]::
43756::$$$message_0389_0012_0003$$$::...Maybe she feels she doesn't have to hide it anymore.[lr]::
43757::$$$message_0389_0012_0004$$$::Taking down her hood, the woman shows her real face and slowly approaches her Master.::
43758::$$$message_0389_0013_0000$$$::"Hah...ah...ah..."[lr]::
43759::$$$message_0389_0013_0001$$$::...Her body is crumbling.[lr]::
43760::$$$message_0389_0013_0002$$$::At the brink of her death, the woman looks upon her emotionless Master.[lr]::
43761::$$$message_0389_0013_0003$$$::She gently caresses the man's face with her hand.::
43762::$$$message_0389_0014_0000$$$::"Master, a-are you alright?"[lr]::
43763::$$$message_0389_0014_0001$$$::Her breath getting shallower with each fading second.[lr]::
43764::$$$message_0389_0014_0002$$$::Kuzuki shows no changes.[lr]::
43765::$$$message_0389_0014_0003$$$::He simply utters a short confirmation, and he does not even bother to turn his gaze on Caster.::
43766::$$$message_0389_0015_0000$$$::"I'm glad. I just can't...afford to see you die..."[lr]::
43767::$$$message_0389_0015_0001$$$::This is fine... Wait.[lr]::
43768::$$$message_0389_0015_0002$$$::...The woman lets out a smile realizing that perhaps she's content because of this man.::
43769::$$$message_0389_0016_0000$$$::"Truly unfortunate. Just when I had...finally found my wish."[lr]::
43770::$$$message_0389_0016_0001$$$::The woman's hand drops down from the man's face.[lr]::
43771::$$$message_0389_0016_0002$$$::Caster's body starts to disintegrate from her feet.::
43772::$$$message_0389_0017_0000$$$::"No need for you to weep. It simply means I will fulfill your wishes in your stead."[lr]::
43773::$$$message_0389_0017_0001$$$::His simple and straight answer makes her smile.[lr]::
43774::$$$message_0389_0017_0002$$$::She smiles, and looks at him like she's staring into a fading dream,[lr]::
43775::$$$message_0389_0017_0003$$$::"I don't think that will be possible. Because my wish..."::
43776::$$$message_0389_0018_0000$$$::                                        ...had already been fulfilled.::
43777::$$$message_0389_0018_0001$$$::The great witch fades away as she falls to her eternal slumber.::
43778::$$$message_0389_0019_0000$$$::...Her purple robe falls to the ground.[lr]::
43779::$$$message_0389_0019_0001$$$::Without its owner, the robe also follows its master and fades into the wind.::
43780::$$$message_0389_0020_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
43781::$$$message_0389_0020_0001$$$::Not spending a moment looking at Caster, Kuzuki had turned his attention to that guy.[lr]::
43782::$$$message_0389_0020_0002$$$::To the guy probably standing above me, to the knight wearing a red cloak.::
43783::$$$message_0389_0021_0000$$$::...My head hurts.[lr]::
43784::$$$message_0389_0021_0001$$$::It's not from the burden of Projecting too many weapons.[lr]::
43785::$$$message_0389_0021_0002$$$::It's that chant.[lr]::
43786::$$$message_0389_0021_0003$$$::The chant that came out of that guy's mouth is attacking my brain with a constant feeling of nausea.::
43787::$$$message_0389_0022_0000$$$::...Trace on.[lr]::
43788::$$$message_0389_0022_0001$$$::I'm certain that's what he said.[lr]::
43789::$$$message_0389_0022_0002$$$::I keep telling myself it's not possible for him to whisper those words, but without a doubt he uttered those exact words.::
43790::$$$message_0389_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43791::$$$message_0389_0023_0001$$$::Archer walks down into the church.[lr]::
43792::$$$message_0389_0023_0002$$$::Tohsaka stares at Archer and is probably still doubting her own eyes.::
43793::$$$message_0389_0024_0000$$$::"...A-Archer... I had thought of the possibility but...did you really?"[lr]::
43794::$$$message_0389_0024_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43795::$$$message_0389_0024_0002$$$::Archer is not saying a word.[lr]::
43796::$$$message_0389_0024_0003$$$::He focuses his sight solely on his enemy, Kuzuki.::
43797::$$$message_0389_0025_0000$$$::"...A viper in one's bosom. I see. That was your plan from the very beginning, Archer."[lr]::
43798::$$$message_0389_0025_0001$$$::"Right. But considering she was one of the many legends uttered in Greek mythology,[lr]::
43799::$$$message_0389_0025_0002$$$::I would say a Trojan Horse would be the more fitting description here."[lr]::
43800::$$$message_0389_0025_0003$$$::Archer betrayed Caster right in front of her Master, yet he shows no traces of regret facing the same man.::
43801::$$$message_0389_0026_0000$$$::"I see. It's Caster's fault for bringing someone like you into our fold."[lr]::
43802::$$$message_0389_0026_0001$$$::Even with the traitor standing in front of him, Kuzuki shows no changes in his tone.[lr]::
43803::$$$message_0389_0026_0002$$$::He still has fight left in him.[lr]::
43804::$$$message_0389_0026_0003$$$::He's not a mage, and he's lost Caster, but Kuzuki still has the will to keep this fight going‚Ä¶::
43805::$$$message_0389_0027_0000$$$::...He resumes his combat stance.[lr]::
43806::$$$message_0389_0027_0001$$$::Without Caster, Kuzuki's combat ability should have decreased drastically.[lr]::
43807::$$$message_0389_0027_0002$$$::Even if he's still the same dangerous viper, Caster's boon that turned his fists to steel should've been gone by now.[lr]::
43808::$$$message_0389_0027_0003$$$::Despite that, Kuzuki still decides to face Archer.::
43809::$$$message_0389_0028_0000$$$::"I see. I won't stop you if you wish to continue."[lr]::
43810::$$$message_0389_0028_0001$$$::Archer takes up his swords.[lr]::
43811::$$$message_0389_0028_0002$$$::There are unseen sparks between them. The battle is set to begin.::
43812::$$$message_0389_0029_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
43813::$$$message_0389_0029_0001$$$::Is that really for the best?[lr]::
43814::$$$message_0389_0029_0002$$$::Kuzuki said he's not interested in the Holy Grail.[lr]::
43815::$$$message_0389_0029_0003$$$::He was simply here to accompany Caster. Truly a Master in name only.[lr]::
43816::$$$message_0389_0029_0004$$$::If that's the case, there shouldn't be any more reasons for Kuzuki to keep fighting now that Caster is gone.::
43817::$$$message_0389_0030_0000$$$:: "...Wait. Why are you doing this, Kuzuki? You were just following what Caster told you to do, right? Caster is not here anymore, you shouldn't have any more reasons to fight."[lr]::
43818::$$$message_0389_0030_0001$$$::My head hurts so much that my consciousness is fading, but I'm fixing my sights on the both of them.::
43819::$$$message_0389_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43820::$$$message_0389_0031_0001$$$::Kuzuki closes his eyes for but a brief moment and answers‚Ä¶::
43821::$$$message_0389_0032_0000$$$::"You're right, I have no reason to fight. Because you see, like you, I'm not interested in this thing you call the Holy Grail."::
43822::$$$message_0389_0033_0000$$$::"Then..."[lr]::
43823::$$$message_0389_0033_0001$$$::"However, this is something I've started. It means I can't just walk away and not finish what I've started."[lr]::
43824::$$$message_0389_0033_0002$$$::It's simple.[lr]::
43825::$$$message_0389_0033_0003$$$::His answer is plain and simple.::
43826::$$$message_0389_0034_0000$$$::...The fight begins.[lr]::
43827::$$$message_0389_0034_0001$$$::This battle between them will probably end in a single encounter.[lr]::
43828::$$$message_0389_0034_0002$$$::Even if Kuzuki possesses martial arts and skills beyond that of a simple human, his opponent is a Servant.[lr]::
43829::$$$message_0389_0034_0003$$$::Simply being better than normal humans is not enough.::
43830::$$$message_0389_0035_0000$$$::This fight is just an excuse to tighten up a loose end.[lr]::
43831::$$$message_0389_0035_0001$$$::This is the fate of the loser.[lr]::
43832::$$$message_0389_0035_0002$$$::A fight between the two Masters is always going to be kill or be killed, so what's going happen to Kuzuki is to be expected. If one is going to have a problem with this then don't ever step into this war.[lr]::
43833::$$$message_0389_0035_0003$$$::Even so...[lr]::Î…
