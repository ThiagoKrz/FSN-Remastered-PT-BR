40232::$$$message_0347_0000_0000$$$::The sun sets.[lr]::
40233::$$$message_0347_0000_0001$$$::The sun that wasn't even visible sets, and the sky that was already gloomy gets even darker.::
40234::$$$message_0347_0001_0000$$$::"...I see. So Saber got taken away."[lr]::
40235::$$$message_0347_0001_0001$$$::That was Archer's only response.[lr]::
40236::$$$message_0347_0001_0002$$$::His Master, Rin Tohsaka, stated the truth simply, but his brevity surpasses hers.::
40237::$$$message_0347_0002_0000$$$::"...That's it? There's two Servants under Caster now. Don't you have anything else to say?"[lr]::
40238::$$$message_0347_0002_0001$$$::"Yeah, I cannot think of any way to get out of this. But we should consider it fortunate that we found out her Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
40239::$$$message_0347_0002_0002$$$::   Break the contract between Servant and Master, huh? We should be able to do better if we know that ahead of time."[lr]::
40240::$$$message_0347_0002_0003$$$::"That is true.[lr]::
40241::$$$message_0347_0002_0004$$$::...You sound rather uninterested, Archer. Weren't you supporting Saber?"::
40242::$$$message_0347_0003_0000$$$::"...I do not think I ever displayed such behavior. What makes you think that, Rin?"[lr]::
40243::$$$message_0347_0003_0001$$$::"Let's see. Would a woman's intuition be a good enough reason?"[lr]::
40244::$$$message_0347_0003_0002$$$::"No. You are not of an age to be called a woman. First of all, you do not have enough charm.[lr]::
40245::$$$message_0347_0003_0003$$$::You also lack elegance.[lr]::
40246::$$$message_0347_0003_0004$$$::On top of that... Yeah, this is fatal, but your cuteness is hard to understand."::
40247::$$$message_0347_0004_0000$$$::"...Heh. I see. You're finally back to par, now."[lr]::
40248::$$$message_0347_0004_0001$$$::She smiles happily.[lr]::
40249::$$$message_0347_0004_0002$$$::It's not Archer if he's not like this.[lr]::
40250::$$$message_0347_0004_0003$$$::An unemotional Archer is not a partner Rin trusts.[lr]::
40251::$$$message_0347_0004_0004$$$::Her partner always has to be composed and speak sarcastically to anyone, regardless of who it is.::
40252::$$$message_0347_0005_0000$$$::Rin realizes that this is the knight's kindness.[lr]::
40253::$$$message_0347_0005_0001$$$::Speaking sarcastically is like him indirectly telling others to fix parts of themselves.::
40254::$$$message_0347_0006_0000$$$::"I see. Then here's the first item of proof.[lr]::
40255::$$$message_0347_0006_0001$$$::You went easy on Saber the first time you met her, didn't you?[lr]::
40256::$$$message_0347_0006_0002$$$::Regardless of how strong Saber is, I don't think you, a good defender, can be beaten with one blow."::
40257::$$$message_0347_0007_0000$$$::"That was a surprise attack. Like you, I am weak against unexpected events."[lr]::
40258::$$$message_0347_0007_0001$$$::"Shut up. So, next item of proof.[lr]::
40259::$$$message_0347_0007_0002$$$::You provoked Saber after the incident with Rider, right?[lr]::
40260::$$$message_0347_0007_0003$$$::That wasn't like you at all.[lr]::
40261::$$$message_0347_0007_0004$$$::I realized once I looked at it from a different perspective. You were scolding Saber back then, right?"::
40262::$$$message_0347_0008_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
40263::$$$message_0347_0008_0001$$$::"Oh, was I right? I knew it. I thought that was the case. Even if you knew her from your previous life, it's rare for you to act so coldly."[lr]::
40264::$$$message_0347_0008_0002$$$::"Really? I think I act that way towards anyone."[lr]::
40265::$$$message_0347_0008_0003$$$::"You're the only one who thinks so. I think you're awkward whenever it comes to things that concern you. Everyone was fooled though, because you're usually tactful."::
40266::$$$message_0347_0009_0000$$$::Archer frowns, as if reflecting on himself.[lr]::
40267::$$$message_0347_0009_0001$$$::It seems like he's aware of it.[lr]::
40268::$$$message_0347_0009_0002$$$::The red knight goes silent with a troubled expression, and his Master looks at that with pleasure.[lr]::
40269::$$$message_0347_0009_0003$$$::Then, suddenly...[lr]::
40270::$$$message_0347_0009_0004$$$::"So, have you remembered what kind of hero you are? If you're related to Saber, you must be a hero from around that age, right?"[lr]::
40271::$$$message_0347_0009_0005$$$::She asks, as if to test him.::
40272::$$$message_0347_0010_0000$$$::"...No, it's still hazy.[lr]::
40273::$$$message_0347_0010_0001$$$::But as you said, I do remember Saber. She does not seem to know me, so it must have not been a deep connection."[lr]::
40274::$$$message_0347_0010_0002$$$::"Hmm. So you weren't friends or lovers.[lr]::
40275::$$$message_0347_0010_0003$$$::Too bad. I would've found out her identity if that was the case."[lr]::
40276::$$$message_0347_0010_0004$$$::She doesn't sound disappointed.[lr]::
40277::$$$message_0347_0010_0005$$$::A forced line that's not genuine.::
40278::$$$message_0347_0011_0000$$$::"Well, I'll remember eventually.[lr]::
40279::$$$message_0347_0011_0001$$$::More importantly, Rin. How is the one you brought here doing? Is it not life threatening?"::
40280::$$$message_0347_0012_0000$$$::"...No, he managed to escape death. Until yesterday, his wounds would heal automatically, but this wound isn't healing at all. The healing powers he got from Saber must've gone away since the contract broke off.[lr]::
40281::$$$message_0347_0012_0001$$$::But, it turned out okay somehow. Fortunately, it missed his vital spots, so he should be able to eat meals if he rests for about three days."::
40282::$$$message_0347_0013_0000$$$::"No, not that one. The other one."[lr]::
40283::$$$message_0347_0013_0001$$$::"Huh? Oh, Ms. Fujimura? I let her sleep in the guestroom. Caster cast a sleeping spell on her, but she's completely fine. I treated her, so there shouldn't be a problem even if she sleeps for a week."::
40284::$$$message_0347_0014_0000$$$::"...I see. But, she might turn into sleeping beauty with Caster's magecraft. Her magecraft is more like a curse. The simplest way to dispel it is to kill Caster."[lr]::
40285::$$$message_0347_0014_0001$$$::"Yeah. Either way, the Holy Grail won't last much longer. We're going to defeat Caster as soon as possible, and knowing Ms. Fujimura, she might just wake up on her own."[lr]::
40286::$$$message_0347_0014_0002$$$::Archer agrees.[lr]::
40287::$$$message_0347_0014_0003$$$::And after a brief pause in the conversation...::
40288::$$$message_0347_0015_0000$$$::"Beating Caster is first priority. Even though there's one less Master, Saber still exists. We do not have time to spare, Rin."[lr]::
40289::$$$message_0347_0015_0001$$$::"I know, we'll go out into town right away.[lr]::
40290::$$$message_0347_0015_0002$$$:: Even Caster should take some time to completely control Saber. If possible, we need to defeat Caster before Saber gets manipulated."::
40291::$$$message_0347_0016_0000$$$::"Understood. So, the contract with that brat ends here, huh?"[lr]::
40292::$$$message_0347_0016_0001$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
40293::$$$message_0347_0016_0002$$$::"Do not 'huh' me. Shirou Emiya is not a Master anymore, right?[lr]::
40294::$$$message_0347_0016_0003$$$::Then he will not be of help, so there will be no need to protect him. The second Command Spell that you used can be terminated now."[lr]::
40295::$$$message_0347_0016_0004$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40296::$$$message_0347_0016_0005$$$::"What is it? Do not tell me that you will look after him since you fought together."[lr]::
40297::$$$message_0347_0016_0006$$$::"...Of course not. I'm not that good of a person."::
40298::$$$message_0347_0017_0000$$$::"Then[line2]"[lr]::
40299::$$$message_0347_0017_0001$$$::"But, it's not over yet. I won't break our promise until he says that he's quitting.[lr]::
40300::$$$message_0347_0017_0002$$$::...I'll try to turn him down, but I can't end it until he says that he gives up."[lr]::
40301::$$$message_0347_0017_0003$$$::She declares, even though she is not sure.[lr]::
40302::$$$message_0347_0017_0004$$$::Besides, how can he rebel against that?::
40303::$$$message_0347_0018_0000$$$::"That's my policy. Do you have any objections, Archer?"[lr]::
40304::$$$message_0347_0018_0001$$$::"...It cannot be helped. I am painfully aware that you are that kind of person."[lr]::
40305::$$$message_0347_0018_0002$$$::His reply is sarcastic.[lr]::
40306::$$$message_0347_0018_0003$$$::She snorts as she orders him.[lr]::
40307::$$$message_0347_0018_0004$$$:: "Let's go, Archer. I don't know why, but Caster isn't back at the Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
40308::$$$message_0347_0018_0005$$$::Then... Let's find and defeat her before she gets back."[lr]::
40309::$$$message_0347_0018_0006$$$::There is no need to answer.[lr]::
40310::$$$message_0347_0018_0007$$$::The knight in red silently nods and follows behind his Master.::
40311::$$$message_0347_0019_0000$$$::There are still masses of gloomy clouds in the sky.[lr]::
40312::$$$message_0347_0019_0001$$$::A moonless night. She departs with an Archer to aim at her target.::
