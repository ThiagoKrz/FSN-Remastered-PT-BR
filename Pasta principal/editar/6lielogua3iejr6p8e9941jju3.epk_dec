31649::$$$message_0254_0000_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
31650::$$$message_0254_0000_0001$$$::When I come to my senses, I realize I'm in a fantastical place.[lr]::
31651::$$$message_0254_0000_0002$$$::An endless, barren land, as far as the eye can see.[lr]::
31652::$$$message_0254_0000_0003$$$::The unceasing wind blows golden sand into my eyes.::
31653::$$$message_0254_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31654::$$$message_0254_0001_0001$$$::There I stand, my mind blank, amidst it all.[lr]::
31655::$$$message_0254_0001_0002$$$::I feel no reason for confusion or panic.[lr]::
31656::$$$message_0254_0001_0003$$$::I know this scenery.[lr]::
31657::$$$message_0254_0001_0004$$$::I've had a dream of this before.[lr]::
31658::$$$message_0254_0001_0005$$$::So this must also be a dream. I'm lucid enough to simply wait for the end.::
31659::$$$message_0254_0002_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
31660::$$$message_0254_0002_0001$$$::A strange feeling suddenly runs up my arm.[lr]::
31661::$$$message_0254_0002_0002$$$::The sound of metal clanking.[lr]::
31662::$$$message_0254_0002_0003$$$::When I roll up my sleeve, there's...[lr]::
31663::$$$message_0254_0002_0004$$$::My arm is now made of blades.::
31664::$$$message_0254_0003_0000$$$::"Ahhh!!!"[lr]::
31665::$$$message_0254_0003_0001$$$::I jump up from my bed.[lr]::
31666::$$$message_0254_0003_0002$$$::Before I realize that I'm in my room, I check my right arm.::
31667::$$$message_0254_0004_0000$$$::"Oh... Huh?"[lr]::
31668::$$$message_0254_0004_0001$$$::...It's fine.[lr]::
31669::$$$message_0254_0004_0002$$$::My right arm is normal.[lr]::
31670::$$$message_0254_0004_0003$$$::It doesn't feel hard like metal, nor has it become blades.::
31671::$$$message_0254_0005_0000$$$::"...A dream."[lr]::
31672::$$$message_0254_0005_0001$$$::I sigh in relief.[lr]::
31673::$$$message_0254_0005_0002$$$::I don't know why I had a dream like that, but it might have to do with the fact that I made a contract with Saber.::
31674::$$$message_0254_0006_0000$$$::"...Maybe I should try asking Tohsaka about it when I have the chance. And more importantly, I need to go prepare breakfast."[lr]::
31675::$$$message_0254_0006_0001$$$::It's before 6 AM.[lr]::
31676::$$$message_0254_0006_0002$$$::Even though Sakura isn't here starting from today, there's still Saber and Fuji-nee.[lr]::
31677::$$$message_0254_0006_0003$$$::It's late to start preparing breakfast for the three of us, even now.::
31678::$$$message_0254_0007_0000$$$::I make my way to the living room, trying not to make any sound.[lr]::
31679::$$$message_0254_0007_0001$$$::"...Hm?"[lr]::
31680::$$$message_0254_0007_0002$$$::I pause and try to figure out how they're doing on the other side of the sliding door.[lr]::
31681::$$$message_0254_0007_0003$$$::...I hear Fuji-nee's restless snoring and Saber's even breathing.::
31682::$$$message_0254_0008_0000$$$::"Huh."[lr]::
31683::$$$message_0254_0008_0001$$$::My guard must've gone down as thoughts of what it must look like in there flitter in.[lr]::
31684::$$$message_0254_0008_0002$$$::I hide my blushing face with my hands and breathe in the cold air from outside.::
31685::$$$message_0254_0009_0000$$$::"...I need more training. Let me go make breakfast."[lr]::
31686::$$$message_0254_0009_0001$$$::I shake my head and walk away.[lr]::
31687::$$$message_0254_0009_0002$$$::...But...[lr]::
31688::$$$message_0254_0009_0003$$$::I don't think it's good for my mental health to have girls sleeping under the same roof as me after all...::
31689::$$$message_0254_0010_0000$$$::"I'll be heading out first then. Don't be late just because you're by yourself."[lr]::
31690::$$$message_0254_0010_0001$$$::"Okay, okay. You do your best on your work in the morning, too."[lr]::
31691::$$$message_0254_0010_0002$$$::"Yeah, thanks. Breakfast was yummy, Shirou."[lr]::
31692::$$$message_0254_0010_0003$$$::Fuji-nee bows and heads to school.::
31693::$$$message_0254_0011_0000$$$::"...Well."[lr]::
31694::$$$message_0254_0011_0001$$$::There's still thirty minutes.[lr]::
31695::$$$message_0254_0011_0002$$$::I'm already done cleaning up, so I should fulfill yesterday's agreement.::
31696::$$$message_0254_0012_0000$$$::The wounds from the slash at my shoulder and from when I fell down the stairs have completely healed.[lr]::
31697::$$$message_0254_0012_0001$$$::On top of that, I have some time, so I train with Saber first thing in the morning.::
31698::$$$message_0254_0013_0000$$$::"Hah...gah...!"[lr]::
31699::$$$message_0254_0013_0001$$$::The sounds of our practice swords echo.[lr]::
31700::$$$message_0254_0013_0002$$$::The clashing of bamboo makes a pleasant sound.[lr]::
31701::$$$message_0254_0013_0003$$$::Learning by watching others cannot be underestimated.[lr]::
31702::$$$message_0254_0013_0004$$$::Just picturing an example before I grip my sword makes it a lot lighter and easier to use.::
31703::$$$message_0254_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31704::$$$message_0254_0014_0001$$$::As usual, Saber repels my attacks without losing her breath.::
31705::$$$message_0254_0015_0000$$$::But is something wrong with her this morning?[lr]::
31706::$$$message_0254_0015_0001$$$::Until yesterday, I would've lost my consciousness the moment I got parried, but I'm able to manage her counterattacks today.[lr]::
31707::$$$message_0254_0015_0002$$$::...Well, when I say manage, I mean I can avoid the worst case scenario where my vision goes completely white, even if her counterattacks are still effective.::
31708::$$$message_0254_0016_0000$$$::"...Phew."[lr]::
31709::$$$message_0254_0016_0001$$$::I put down my bamboo sword and breathe out the heat built up in my lungs.[lr]::
31710::$$$message_0254_0016_0002$$$::The clock is already pointing at 8 AM.[lr]::
31711::$$$message_0254_0016_0003$$$::Before I knew it, an hour had passed since I started training with Saber.[lr]::
31712::$$$message_0254_0016_0004$$$::Since my body was able to react better to Saber's sword, and probably also because she didn't seem to have it in her, it was easy to get carried away and lose track of time.::
31713::$$$message_0254_0017_0000$$$::"Man, I worked up a sweat... But what's wrong with you this morning, Saber? I don't feel as much severity in your attacks compared to yesterday."::
31714::$$$message_0254_0018_0000$$$::"That is not true. I fought the same as I did yesterday. The attacks must have felt lighter because your skills are improving."::
31715::$$$message_0254_0019_0000$$$::"Huh? My skills? Really?"[lr]::
31716::$$$message_0254_0019_0001$$$::Saber nods.[lr]::
31717::$$$message_0254_0019_0002$$$::...Um, well, it doesn't seem like flattery, and Saber isn't the type to say those kind of things to start with...::
31718::$$$message_0254_0020_0000$$$::"Really?"[lr]::
31719::$$$message_0254_0020_0001$$$::"I'm surprised. Your technique is like a different person compared to yesterday."::
31720::$$$message_0254_0021_0000$$$::"...You think so? No, that can't be true. You just aren't doing as well today. Martial arts instructors would lose their job if someone could get better in just a day."::
31721::$$$message_0254_0022_0000$$$::"I feel the same way, but...let me see. To be specific, there are fewer unnecessary movements in you now. Your body is already fit, so you can improve just by learning proper techniques."::
31722::$$$message_0254_0023_0000$$$::"Fewer unnecessary movements...?"[lr]::
31723::$$$message_0254_0023_0001$$$::...Come to think of it, my body did move well this morning.[lr]::
31724::$$$message_0254_0023_0002$$$::It seemed as though my sword parried Saber's on its own, even though I couldn't consciously react to it.::
31725::$$$message_0254_0024_0000$$$::"...Hmm. All I did was copy what he was doing."[lr]::
31726::$$$message_0254_0024_0001$$$::"Just as I thought. You ask me to teach you, yet you were using Archer's technique as a model?"::
31727::$$$message_0254_0025_0000$$$::"Huh... Wait, so you can tell!?"[lr]::
31728::$$$message_0254_0025_0001$$$::"Of course. You did not have a style to start with, so anyone would notice if you suddenly found one."::
31729::$$$message_0254_0026_0000$$$::"Oof... Well, it's not like I was ignoring you. It's just that since I was around him a bunch yesterday, it was engraved in my mind..."[lr]::
31730::$$$message_0254_0026_0001$$$::"No, you do not have to deny it. I have no complaints if you are to become stronger."[lr]::
31731::$$$message_0254_0026_0002$$$::...Liar.[lr]::
31732::$$$message_0254_0026_0003$$$::What's with that obviously dissatisfied face?::
31733::$$$message_0254_0027_0000$$$::"I'm telling you I'm sorry. Besides, even if I try to model myself after you, I can't even see how you're attacking. We have different physiques on top if it all. It's impossible to copy you."::
31734::$$$message_0254_0028_0000$$$::"That is a valid point. So, I am just your training partner then?"[lr]::
31735::$$$message_0254_0028_0001$$$::...Eeeargh.[lr]::
31736::$$$message_0254_0028_0002$$$::I feel like I just dug myself into a deeper hole.::
31737::$$$message_0254_0029_0000$$$::"...No. Let's stop talking about this.[lr]::
31738::$$$message_0254_0029_0001$$$::Anyway, it's clear that I'm able to fight a bit now."::
31739::$$$message_0254_0030_0000$$$::"What are you saying? Your skills have improved, but only at the bare minimum level.[lr]::
31740::$$$message_0254_0030_0001$$$::It is not something you can match Archer, Berserker, nor I with, so please do not try to challenge anyone to battle yourself."::
31741::$$$message_0254_0031_0000$$$::Saber is firm.[lr]::
31742::$$$message_0254_0031_0001$$$::It feels like a mentor reprimanding their cocky student, which makes me break into a smile.[lr]::
31743::$$$message_0254_0031_0002$$$::Well, having such a cute mentor is oddly amusing.::'é
