15194::$$$message_0142_0000_0000$$$::"What is the matter? Are you not going to eat, Illyasviel?[lr]::
15195::$$$message_0142_0000_0001$$$::You have eaten less than a third of what you did yesterday."[lr]::
15196::$$$message_0142_0000_0002$$$::"I just can't eat this. I can't eat spicy food."[lr]::
15197::$$$message_0142_0000_0003$$$::"Hm. I do not think it is particularly spicy...the spices used go well with the chicken."::
15198::$$$message_0142_0001_0000$$$::"I said I don't like mustard! Just eat this for me, will you? In return, I'll eat your strawberry for you!"[lr]::
15199::$$$message_0142_0001_0001$$$::"Wh-what are you doing, Illyasviel!?[lr]::
15200::$$$message_0142_0001_0002$$$::Hey! Return that this instant! You may not have that! If you want something sweet, there's apple pie!"::
15201::$$$message_0142_0002_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
15202::$$$message_0142_0002_0001$$$::Illya and Saber sit next to each other, bickering like two close sisters.[lr]::
15203::$$$message_0142_0002_0002$$$::It's just past noon.[lr]::
15204::$$$message_0142_0002_0003$$$::The three of us sit and face each other, eating lunch together just like yesterday.::
15205::$$$message_0142_0003_0000$$$::Oh right. It's not just lunch that's the same as yesterday.[lr]::
15206::$$$message_0142_0003_0001$$$::Our training today was as well.::
15207::$$$message_0142_0004_0000$$$::Today, though, is even more awkward.[lr]::
15208::$$$message_0142_0004_0001$$$::I don't know how to explain it, but something in my chest stirs whenever I face Saber, and I find myself unable to rush at her with the same desperation I used to.::
15209::$$$message_0142_0005_0000$$$::It's not just me. Saber has been acting weird too. It used to be that she never let an opening go by. The last couple days, she's just waited for me to make a move, which has meant the two of us just kind of ended up staring at each other for a while.::
15210::$$$message_0142_0006_0000$$$::"What's going on with you two? You're not very fun to watch now."[lr]::
15211::$$$message_0142_0006_0001$$$::Illya's criticism helped us get back into the swing of things. I managed to go after Saber, but it ended pretty much the same.::
15212::$$$message_0142_0007_0000$$$::She batted aside my half-assed attack, but didn't bother countering.[lr]::
15213::$$$message_0142_0007_0001$$$::Since she didn't follow up, I whirled on Saber, lunged again, and was once more repelled, though she again didn't counterattack.[lr]::
15214::$$$message_0142_0007_0002$$$::Our lackluster session ended about ten minutes ago.::
15215::$$$message_0142_0008_0000$$$::Once again, it was at Saber's suggestion we began our lunch break.[lr]::
15216::$$$message_0142_0008_0001$$$::We're having the same thing we did yesterday: sandwiches.[lr]::
15217::$$$message_0142_0008_0002$$$::I figured it wouldn't do to make them exactly the same as yesterday, so I used a few other ingredients. Everyone seems happy.::
15218::$$$message_0142_0009_0000$$$::Illya is excited over the colorful sandwiches, and Saber takes a deep breath, preparing for her meal.[lr]::
15219::$$$message_0142_0009_0001$$$::I think that's Saber's way of showing her enthusiasm.::
15220::$$$message_0142_0010_0000$$$::It's much rowdier than yesterday.[lr]::
15221::$$$message_0142_0010_0001$$$::It's raining, and the hardwood floor is cold, but this also feels like a picnic.::
15222::$$$message_0142_0011_0000$$$::"Argh, that is enough, Illyasviel.[lr]::
15223::$$$message_0142_0011_0001$$$::If you eat like that, you will dirty your clothes. Honestly, this is what happens when you mimic Shirou and try to eat it in one bite. Your mouth is small, so you should eat more daintily."::
15224::$$$message_0142_0012_0000$$$::"Hmph! You're the one who doesn't understand, Saber. It's even less polite to worry about manners with a meal like this.[lr]::
15225::$$$message_0142_0012_0001$$$::This is a picnic, so this is how you should be eating, right, Shirou!?"::
15226::$$$message_0142_0013_0000$$$::Illya happily munches on a sandwich.[lr]::
15227::$$$message_0142_0013_0001$$$::...And Saber reluctantly wipes Illya's mouth with a napkin.::
15228::$$$message_0142_0014_0000$$$::"Kya...! Haha, that tickles, Saber!"[lr]::
15229::$$$message_0142_0014_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
15230::$$$message_0142_0014_0002$$$::Well, I didn't see this coming.[lr]::
15231::$$$message_0142_0014_0003$$$::Saber and Illya seem to have warmed up to each other.::
15232::$$$message_0142_0015_0000$$$::"This is a surprise. Are you not going to push me away, Illyasviel?"::
15233::$$$message_0142_0016_0000$$$::"Why would I? I love when people are nice to me.[lr]::
15234::$$$message_0142_0016_0001$$$::Yeah, if anyone else tried to touch me, I'd kill them, but Saber's pretty, so I'll allow it.[lr]::
15235::$$$message_0142_0016_0002$$$::And we are sharing a meal now. If Saber likes me, I like her too."[lr]::
15236::$$$message_0142_0016_0003$$$::It's so simple for Illya.::
15237::$$$message_0142_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15238::$$$message_0142_0017_0001$$$::Saber, clearly taken aback, stares at Illya, dumbfounded.[lr]::
15239::$$$message_0142_0017_0002$$$::Even I, just a spectator as this unfolds, am caught off guard by Illya's smile.::
15240::$$$message_0142_0018_0000$$$::"What? You don't think this is fun, Saber?"[lr]::
15241::$$$message_0142_0018_0001$$$::"Oh...no, I...don't..."::
15242::$$$message_0142_0019_0000$$$::"I'm having tons of fun. It's raining outside...this place is so simple and bleak...and there's nothing here that I've ever wanted.[lr]::
15243::$$$message_0142_0019_0001$$$::But just being here is fun. It's much nicer than being all alone. Are you not having fun, Saber?"::
15244::$$$message_0142_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15245::$$$message_0142_0020_0001$$$::Something in Illya's smile must have struck Saber.[lr]::
15246::$$$message_0142_0020_0002$$$::Saber sighs deeply and looks back at her.::
15247::$$$message_0142_0021_0000$$$::"You are correct. I am also enjoying being here."[lr]::
15248::$$$message_0142_0021_0001$$$::She sounds...bright.[lr]::
15249::$$$message_0142_0021_0002$$$::And then Saber smiles in a way I've never seen from her.::
15250::$$$message_0142_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15251::$$$message_0142_0022_0001$$$::I don't know why, but I'm getting emotional.[lr]::
15252::$$$message_0142_0022_0002$$$::That smile was great.[lr]::
15253::$$$message_0142_0022_0003$$$::It was for herself, and herself alone.[lr]::
15254::$$$message_0142_0022_0004$$$::It's not the usual smile I see from her whenever she's protecting someone.[lr]::
15255::$$$message_0142_0022_0005$$$::It's a smile of sheer happiness, for her, from her.::
15256::$$$message_0142_0023_0000$$$::"Shirou? What is that look for? Did something good happen?"[lr]::
15257::$$$message_0142_0023_0001$$$::"Eh? No, nothing... Was I making a funny face?"::
15258::$$$message_0142_0024_0000$$$::"Yep, you were. You made a face like a father[line2]like you're watching over us from afar.[lr]::
15259::$$$message_0142_0024_0001$$$::I don't like it.."[lr]::
15260::$$$message_0142_0024_0002$$$::"Huh, why?"[lr]::
15261::$$$message_0142_0024_0003$$$::I don't understand what she's talking about, but I guess I was just smiling.::
15262::$$$message_0142_0025_0000$$$::"I see...well, something good happened, so I guess I didn't realize I was smiling."[lr]::
15263::$$$message_0142_0025_0001$$$::"Huh. Something good, was it?" ::
15264::$$$message_0142_0026_0000$$$::"Yep, I like the way you smiled just now, Saber. Seeing it made me happy."[lr]::
15265::$$$message_0142_0026_0001$$$::"...What an odd thing to say. That makes you happy, Shirou?"::
15266::$$$message_0142_0027_0000$$$::"Yep. I guess I like seeing you smile like that, Saber."[lr]::
15267::$$$message_0142_0027_0001$$$::Saber nods, though she doesn't seem convinced.::
15268::$$$message_0142_0028_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
15269::$$$message_0142_0028_0001$$$::I don't know what came over her, but she smiles and lifts her head.::
15270::$$$message_0142_0029_0000$$$::"I see. Then it must be the other way around, Shirou."[lr]::
15271::$$$message_0142_0029_0001$$$::"Huh? What do you mean, the other way?"[lr]::
15272::$$$message_0142_0029_0002$$$::"I am happier to see you smiling. If you keep smiling, that is good enough for me."::
15273::$$$message_0142_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15274::$$$message_0142_0030_0001$$$::I can't meet Saber's gaze.[lr]::
15275::$$$message_0142_0030_0002$$$::That smile would make anyone lightheaded.::
15276::$$$message_0142_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15277::$$$message_0142_0031_0001$$$::I manage to calm myself down and glance sidelong at Saber.::
15278::$$$message_0142_0032_0000$$$::She calmly resumes eating her picnic lunch.[lr]::
15279::$$$message_0142_0032_0001$$$::Nothing to worry about there.[lr]::
15280::$$$message_0142_0032_0002$$$::There should be nothing to worry about, yet something is bothering me.::
15281::$$$message_0142_0033_0000$$$::   [font italic=true]I am happier to see you smiling.[font italic=false]::
15282::$$$message_0142_0034_0000$$$::In that smile I saw for the first time...[lr]::
15283::$$$message_0142_0034_0001$$$::...it seemed like she was contradicting herself.:`hn
