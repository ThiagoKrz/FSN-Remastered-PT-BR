49972::$$$message_0432_0000_0000$$$::"...It's morning."[lr]::
49973::$$$message_0432_0000_0001$$$::I slowly open my eyes.[lr]::
49974::$$$message_0432_0000_0002$$$::The night that I thought would last forever ended before I realized it.::
49975::$$$message_0432_0001_0000$$$::"...That's good. The pain is gone."[lr]::
49976::$$$message_0432_0001_0001$$$::I must've not been able to bear it anymore, or it stopped hurting before I knew it.[lr]::
49977::$$$message_0432_0001_0002$$$::Either way, I don't feel any further pain, nor do I feel sleepy or sluggish.[lr]::
49978::$$$message_0432_0001_0003$$$::I was able to sleep for about three hours, and my mind is pretty clear.::
49979::$$$message_0432_0002_0000$$$::"All right. I'll go make breakfast."[lr]::
49980::$$$message_0432_0002_0001$$$::My bed is wet from sweating.[lr]::
49981::$$$message_0432_0002_0002$$$::I force myself up.[lr]::
49982::$$$message_0432_0002_0003$$$::And as soon as I try to stand, my left foot slips.::
49983::$$$message_0432_0003_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
49984::$$$message_0432_0003_0001$$$::I try touching my left foot.[lr]::
49985::$$$message_0432_0003_0002$$$::There's nothing wrong.[lr]::
49986::$$$message_0432_0003_0003$$$::There is no pain or bleeding, but...there's also no sensation at all.::
49987::$$$message_0432_0004_0000$$$::"...Hm."[lr]::
49988::$$$message_0432_0004_0001$$$::It's not just my left leg, either. I don't feel anything in my left arm.[lr]::
49989::$$$message_0432_0004_0002$$$::I try pinching the left side of my chest and feel nothing there as well.::
49990::$$$message_0432_0005_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
49991::$$$message_0432_0005_0001$$$::Has my body still not healed completely?[lr]::
49992::$$$message_0432_0005_0002$$$::The whole left side is numb, and I'm feeling a strange disconnect, like it's someone else's body. Uhh, I have had similar experiences before...::
49993::$$$message_0432_0006_0000$$$::"Like when I sleep in the shed. If I use my arm as a pillow, it'll often feel like this."[lr]::
49994::$$$message_0432_0006_0001$$$::Yeah, of course.[lr]::
49995::$$$message_0432_0006_0002$$$::This is similar to the numbing that one gets when the blood circulation in their limbs temporarily gets cut off.::
49996::$$$message_0432_0007_0000$$$::Well, I can move it, so I guess it'll go back to normal eventually.[lr]::
49997::$$$message_0432_0007_0001$$$::Though my limbs react frustratingly slowly, like I'm moving them by pulling a lever, it hopefully won't affect my daily activity if I'm careful.::
49998::$$$message_0432_0008_0000$$$::I refrain from using a knife this morning and make a simple meal with some bread.[lr]::
49999::$$$message_0432_0008_0001$$$::My dominant hand, the right hand, is safe, so I can use a frying pan.[lr]::
50000::$$$message_0432_0008_0002$$$::I cook bacon and eggs, prepare instant clam chowder for the three of us, and somehow manage to set up the table.::
50001::$$$message_0432_0009_0000$$$::"Thank you for the meal."[lr]::
50002::$$$message_0432_0009_0001$$$::"Dig in."[lr]::
50003::$$$message_0432_0009_0002$$$::We both bite into the golden bread.::
50004::$$$message_0432_0010_0000$$$::Saber nods in approval at the toast and salad.[lr]::
50005::$$$message_0432_0010_0001$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
50006::$$$message_0432_0010_0002$$$::It's interesting seeing Saber holding a rice bowl and chopsticks, but Western food seems more appropriate.::
50007::$$$message_0432_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50008::$$$message_0432_0011_0001$$$::Saber is quiet.[lr]::
50009::$$$message_0432_0011_0002$$$::Though she isn't unfriendly, she does consider silence as a virtue.[lr]::
50010::$$$message_0432_0011_0003$$$::She's like this especially during meals.[lr]::
50011::$$$message_0432_0011_0004$$$::It's more comfortable for me when it's quiet during meals, so a breakfast like this is ideal.::
50012::$$$message_0432_0012_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
50013::$$$message_0432_0012_0001$$$::I finally realize then why it's so quiet this morning.::
50014::$$$message_0432_0013_0000$$$::That would be because...::
50015::$$$message_0432_0014_0000$$$::"Hey, good morning! ...Wait, huh? Are we having French food this morning?"[lr]::
50016::$$$message_0432_0014_0001$$$::Fuji-nee wasn't staying over.::
50017::$$$message_0432_0015_0000$$$::"That's right. I tried my hand at something Café Marly-esque. So please sit and eat." [lr]::
50018::$$$message_0432_0015_0001$$$::I hand Fuji-nee her mug.::
50019::$$$message_0432_0016_0000$$$::"Hm? But you know, it smells like instant food, Shirou."[lr]::
50020::$$$message_0432_0016_0001$$$::"It's your imagination. Your nose isn't working since you just woke up."::
50021::$$$message_0432_0017_0000$$$::"I see. You might be right. Oh, good morning, Saber. Sorry I couldn't come by last night."[lr]::
50022::$$$message_0432_0017_0001$$$::Fuji-nee gulps down hot clam chowder like a sports drink.[lr]::
50023::$$$message_0432_0017_0002$$$::She must have some kind of special coating along her esophagus.::
50024::$$$message_0432_0018_0000$$$::"Good morning, Taiga. I did not see you yesterday, but did something happen?"[lr]::
50025::$$$message_0432_0018_0001$$$::"Hm? Yeah, I had to work... Well, no. I was just going around visiting those in the hospital. But that ended yesterday, so I can relax again today."::
50026::$$$message_0432_0019_0000$$$::She puts margarine on her toast.[lr]::
50027::$$$message_0432_0019_0001$$$::Though it doesn't really matter, Fuji-nee doesn't use butter for some reason.[lr]::
50028::$$$message_0432_0019_0002$$$::I'd try asking why, but I feel like I'd get some sort of stupid response. I'll table that for another day.::
50029::$$$message_0432_0020_0000$$$::"...Hey Fuji-nee, how many of the ones hospitalized are in a serious condition?"[lr]::
50030::$$$message_0432_0020_0001$$$::"No one's in a serious condition. They're all just staying at the hospital to be safe, and they said that everyone can go back to school next week.[lr]::
50031::$$$message_0432_0020_0002$$$::So it's okay, Shirou. Don't worry about this accident. You can go to school without worry."::
50032::$$$message_0432_0021_0000$$$::Fuji-nee bites into her toast with gusto.[lr]::
50033::$$$message_0432_0021_0001$$$::I feel reassured just by watching her. She really looks unconcerned.::
50034::$$$message_0432_0022_0000$$$::"...I see. That's good."[lr]::
50035::$$$message_0432_0022_0001$$$::"Yes, all's right with the world. I'll be looking forward to dinner tonight."::
50036::$$$message_0432_0023_0000$$$::That peaceful smile.[lr]::
50037::$$$message_0432_0023_0001$$$::...Yeah. At times like this, I'm reminded that Fuji-nee is still Fuji-nee.::
50038::$$$message_0432_0024_0000$$$::"I'll get going now. Please take care of the house as usual, Saber."[lr]::
50039::$$$message_0432_0024_0001$$$::"Yes, that is fine, but... Shirou, I did not see anything made in the kitchen, so am I to go without lunch today...?"::
50040::$$$message_0432_0025_0000$$$::"...Mm? Oh, sorry. We have half days on Saturday. I'll be a bit late, but I'll come back by lunchtime, so I'll make lunch."::
50041::$$$message_0432_0026_0000$$$::"I see. Shirou, you must tell me these things beforehand. You do not seem to be on top of things this morning. You have been reacting slowly as well. Is something the matter?"::
50042::$$$message_0432_0027_0000$$$::"Huh? No, not really. My body is still heavy from yesterday, but it should go back to normal soon."[lr]::
50043::$$$message_0432_0027_0001$$$::Sensation hasn't returned to the left side of my body yet, but there should be no problem as I can still move it.[lr]::
50044::$$$message_0432_0027_0002$$$::I don't need to make Saber worry over something like this.::
50045::$$$message_0432_0028_0000$$$::"Well, you're right that I should tell you. Meals are your only hobby. I'll make a big lunch to make up for it, so let's call it even."[lr]::
50046::$$$message_0432_0028_0001$$$::I wave goodbye and go to the door.::
50047::$$$message_0432_0029_0000$$$::"No. I cannot agree with what you just said. It is only that I would not have energy in the case of an emergency if I skip meals[line2]"[lr]::
50048::$$$message_0432_0029_0001$$$::"Okay, okay. See you later, Saber!"[wsay canskip=1]::
50049::$$$message_0432_0030_0000$$$::I leave Saber's complaints behind me.[lr]::
50050::$$$message_0432_0030_0001$$$::"Woah... This is more tiring than I thought."::
50051::$$$message_0432_0031_0000$$$::I touch my numb left foot.[lr]::
50052::$$$message_0432_0031_0001$$$::It was fine back home, but now that I'm walking this is starting to make me feel ill.[lr]::
50053::$$$message_0432_0031_0002$$$::Even if it doesn't affect my movements, it seems to affect me mentally to walk dragging a body with no senses.::
50054::$$$message_0432_0032_0000$$$::"...No, I can't complain about something like this. The others had it way worse."[lr]::
50055::$$$message_0432_0032_0001$$$::Even though she healed, Saber got her throat crushed and was smashed against a wall.[lr]::
50056::$$$message_0432_0032_0002$$$::Tohsaka was coughing from receiving that blow from Kuzuki.[lr]::
50057::$$$message_0432_0032_0003$$$::Compared to those two, it's nothing since I didn't actually get wounded.::
50058::$$$message_0432_0033_0000$$$::"...Well..."[lr]::
50059::$$$message_0432_0033_0001$$$::I force my leg to move and start down the hill.[lr]::
50060::$$$message_0432_0033_0002$$$::...I feel slightly nauseous.[lr]::
50061::$$$message_0432_0033_0003$$$::With uncertain steps, I make it down the usual path to school, weaving around like a ghost.::
50062::$$$message_0432_0034_0000$$$::And so...[lr]::
50063::$$$message_0432_0034_0001$$$::School's over before I knew it.::
50064::$$$message_0432_0035_0000$$$::It might be because my body still doesn't feel right, but my sense of time is all over the place.[lr]::
50065::$$$message_0432_0035_0001$$$::I don't remember any of the material from class, and I'm not too sure of what I did either.::
50066::$$$message_0432_0036_0000$$$::"...Could this really be serious?"[lr]::
50067::$$$message_0432_0036_0001$$$::The left side of my body doesn't change.[lr]::
50068::$$$message_0432_0036_0002$$$::It makes me depressed feeling so numb for this long.::
50069::$$$message_0432_0037_0000$$$::"And the sensation is getting stronger, like everything is heavier."[lr]::
50070::$$$message_0432_0037_0001$$$::...My nausea isn't going away. And of course, Kuzuki wasn't at school.::
50071::$$$message_0432_0038_0000$$$::"...I should go home. Saber should be hungry too."[lr]::
50072::$$$message_0432_0038_0001$$$::I grab my bag and stand from my seat.[lr]::
50073::$$$message_0432_0038_0002$$$::Amidst all this, I feel like I'm forgetting something. Though I figure I'll remember once I get home.::
50074::$$$message_0432_0039_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
50075::$$$message_0432_0039_0001$$$::Once I finish walking up the hill with my numb left foot, I remember what I forgot.::
50076::$$$message_0432_0040_0000$$$::"I forgot to talk to Tohsaka."[lr]::
50077::$$$message_0432_0040_0001$$$::So preoccupied was I that it completely slipped my mind. My spacey, hazy mind.[lr]::
50078::$$$message_0432_0040_0002$$$::Well, I'm sure nothing important happened since she didn't immediately come find me.[lr]::
50079::$$$message_0432_0040_0003$$$::Considering my condition, I can just contact her once I get better.::
50080::$$$message_0432_0041_0000$$$::"I'm home."[lr]::
50081::$$$message_0432_0041_0001$$$::I call out in a loud voice so Saber can hear from her room and go straight to the kitchen.::
50082::$$$message_0432_0042_0000$$$::I put the ingredients that I bought in the refrigerator, wash my hands, and put on my apron.[lr]::
50083::$$$message_0432_0042_0001$$$::The plan is to make cod for dinner, so for lunch it'll be some kind of meat or poultry. [lr]::
50084::$$$message_0432_0042_0002$$$::A meal of chicken teriyaki for the main course sounds good, so I get to work on that.::
50085::$$$message_0432_0043_0000$$$::"Are you home, Shirou?"[lr]::
50086::$$$message_0432_0043_0001$$$::Saber must've heard the noise, as she comes in from the porch.::
50087::$$$message_0432_0044_0000$$$::"Yeah, sorry I'm late. I'll make lunch right away, so you can rest. You must be hungry[line2]"[lr]::
50088::$$$message_0432_0044_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...Crap.[font italic=false][lr]::
50089::$$$message_0432_0044_0002$$$::I got distracted by Saber and dropped the plate in my hand.::
50090::$$$message_0432_0045_0000$$$::"Shirou, the plate is broken."[lr]::
50091::$$$message_0432_0045_0001$$$::"Yeah. It's my first time breaking a plate."[lr]::
50092::$$$message_0432_0045_0002$$$::I'm surprised myself. Surprised enough to say something stupid, too.::
50093::$$$message_0432_0046_0000$$$::"Sorry. I'll clean it up right away, so you can go sit down."[lr]::
50094::$$$message_0432_0046_0001$$$::I pick up a piece.[lr]::
50095::$$$message_0432_0046_0002$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
50096::$$$message_0432_0046_0003$$$::I fumble and drop it too.::
50097::$$$message_0432_0047_0000$$$::"...You seem tired, Shirou.[lr]::
50098::$$$message_0432_0047_0001$$$::No, I will clean it up. Please focus on cooking."::
50099::$$$message_0432_0048_0000$$$::I guess trying to pick it up with my left hand was a mistake.[lr]::
50100::$$$message_0432_0048_0001$$$::...Well, it was a good lesson.[lr]::
50101::$$$message_0432_0048_0002$$$::My left hand still hasn't regained feeling. I'll need to be incredibly careful with a knife.::
50102::$$$message_0432_0049_0000$$$::"Shirou. Please do not push yourself. Make something simple. I am happy that you are putting in the effort, but I'd rather not have blood mixed into the meal."[lr]::
50103::$$$message_0432_0049_0001$$$::Well, I don't want that either.[lr]::
50104::$$$message_0432_0049_0002$$$::That is a failure for someone in charge of the kitchen.::
50105::$$$message_0432_0050_0000$$$::"All right. I'll put effort into dinner and make lunch simple. I'll still make the main dish, but I won't be using any pumpkin or radish. Is that okay?"[lr]::
50106::$$$message_0432_0050_0001$$$::I put two hundred grams of chicken on the cutting board and carefully ready my fork.[lr]::
50107::$$$message_0432_0050_0002$$$::I have to at least make the main dish without cutting any corners because of what I told Saber this morning.::
50108::$$$message_0432_0051_0000$$$::"Yes. I am looking forward to it, Shirou."[lr]::
50109::$$$message_0432_0051_0001$$$::It's like she can sense my enthusiasm. ::
50110::$$$message_0432_0052_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50111::$$$message_0432_0052_0001$$$::That has me even more motivated.[lr]::
50112::$$$message_0432_0052_0002$$$::I'll poke some holes first with the fork to prepare, and...::
50113::$$$message_0432_0053_0000$$$::"...The doorbell?"[lr]::
50114::$$$message_0432_0053_0001$$$::"It seems like there is a visitor, Shirou."[lr]::
50115::$$$message_0432_0053_0002$$$::"Seems like it. I'll go get it."::
