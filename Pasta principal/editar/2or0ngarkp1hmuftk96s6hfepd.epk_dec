66376::$$$message_0614_0000_0000$$$::Tohsaka is waiting at the door.[lr]::
66377::$$$message_0614_0000_0001$$$::It's now 10:00 PM.[lr]::
66378::$$$message_0614_0000_0002$$$::Time to go out on night patrol, even if it might be a waste of time.::
66379::$$$message_0614_0001_0000$$$::"...That was quick. How's Sakura?"[lr]::
66380::$$$message_0614_0001_0001$$$::"I got her into bed. She's clearly tired, no matter what she says. She fell asleep as soon as she lied down."::
66381::$$$message_0614_0002_0000$$$::"Okay. We'll leave the rest to Illya and Rider. I haven't seen her around, but Rider's somewhere in the house, guarding Sakura."::
66382::$$$message_0614_0003_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
66383::$$$message_0614_0003_0001$$$::As Tohsaka says, Rider's constantly protecting Sakura.[lr]::
66384::$$$message_0614_0003_0002$$$::She probably hasn't taken material form to avoid burdening Sakura.::
66385::$$$message_0614_0004_0000$$$::                          [font italic=true]"She is unlikely to last even a few more days."[font italic=false]::
66386::$$$message_0614_0005_0000$$$::...I recall the priest's words.[lr]::
66387::$$$message_0614_0005_0001$$$::As long as the Holy Grail War continues, the Crest Worms inside Sakura will keep eating her magical energy.[lr]::
66388::$$$message_0614_0005_0002$$$::In her state, it's dangerous to materialize her Servant, and even if she does, Rider won't be able to fight.[lr]::
66389::$$$message_0614_0005_0003$$$::Rider must be standing guard in spirit form, with that in mind.::
66390::$$$message_0614_0006_0000$$$::"You look gloomy. Something you want to say?"[lr]::
66391::$$$message_0614_0006_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
66392::$$$message_0614_0006_0002$$$::Something I want to say...?[lr]::
66393::$$$message_0614_0006_0003$$$::That's a dumb question. Of course there is.::
66394::$$$message_0614_0007_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. Can we take down Zouken tonight?"[lr]::
66395::$$$message_0614_0007_0001$$$::We can't afford to drag this out much longer.[lr]::
66396::$$$message_0614_0007_0002$$$::Sakura grows weaker every day.[lr]::
66397::$$$message_0614_0007_0003$$$::If the priest is to be believed, she could die tomorrow.::
66398::$$$message_0614_0008_0000$$$::"No. We can't beat him right now.[lr]::
66399::$$$message_0614_0008_0001$$$::...I understand the urgency, but you'll need to be patient if you want to save Sakura. If we go down, then there's no one else to help her."[lr]::
66400::$$$message_0614_0008_0002$$$::"...We can't fight yet. I get that. But then..."::
66401::$$$message_0614_0009_0000$$$::"You think there's no point in going out on patrol? Shirou, do you think defeating Zouken is all we need to do? Of course not, right? I thought we were also trying to stop innocent people from dying in the Holy Grail War."::
66402::$$$message_0614_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66403::$$$message_0614_0010_0001$$$::...She's right.[lr]::
66404::$$$message_0614_0010_0002$$$::I know that. I do.[lr]::
66405::$$$message_0614_0010_0003$$$::There's a purpose to these patrols. We'll have to flee if we run into the enemy, but we have to do whatever we can to prevent more people from falling victim like they did last night.[lr]::
66406::$$$message_0614_0010_0004$$$::But...[lr]::
66407::$$$message_0614_0010_0005$$$::What exactly did I swear to protect again...?::
66408::$$$message_0614_0011_0000$$$::"Shirou...? Hey Emiya, are you okay?"[lr]::
66409::$$$message_0614_0011_0001$$$::"...Just a little dizzy. Sorry about that, Tohsaka. It was thoughtless of me."::
66410::$$$message_0614_0012_0000$$$::"It's okay, you don't need to apologize. Sakura's in danger, but you're tired too.[lr]::
66411::$$$message_0614_0012_0001$$$::Actually, I should have had you learn today's Projection over three days. I understand why you'd want to go fight him right away, since you succeeded on the first day."::
66412::$$$message_0614_0013_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
66413::$$$message_0614_0013_0001$$$::I learned how to use Projection today?::
66414::$$$message_0614_0014_0000$$$::"What's wrong? Did I say something strange?"[lr]::
66415::$$$message_0614_0014_0001$$$::"...No, um. Today's training was so hard, and it took everything I had just to hang in there. It still doesn't quite feel real."::
66416::$$$message_0614_0015_0000$$$::"Yeah, you looked like you were in a trance. But it was worth it, and you managed to Project one dagger at the end.[lr]::
66417::$$$message_0614_0015_0001$$$::Though, your success rate is still under ten percent, so it still needs work."::
66418::$$$message_0614_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66419::$$$message_0614_0016_0001$$$::...Well, that makes sense if it happened while I was in a trance.[lr]::
66420::$$$message_0614_0016_0002$$$::My sense of time must have gone numb from concentrating so hard. It felt like evening came before I even knew it.::
66421::$$$message_0614_0017_0000$$$::   By the time I notice that something's wrong, we've already gone into town.::
66422::$$$message_0614_0018_0000$$$::Tohsaka must have noticed it too, because she's quietly trying to sense something.[lr]::
66423::$$$message_0614_0018_0001$$$::The view is familiar.[lr]::
66424::$$$message_0614_0018_0002$$$::The town is dark and quiet after 10:00 PM.[lr]::
66425::$$$message_0614_0018_0003$$$::There's nobody on the streets, and no sound at all.[lr]::
66426::$$$message_0614_0018_0004$$$::It's a silent night that I've grown used to seeing since the Holy Grail War started.[lr]::
66427::$$$message_0614_0018_0005$$$::But, it's...::
66428::$$$message_0614_0019_0000$$$::"...It's quiet."[lr]::
66429::$$$message_0614_0019_0001$$$::Tohsaka whispers next to me.[lr]::
66430::$$$message_0614_0019_0002$$$::...Yes.[lr]::
66431::$$$message_0614_0019_0003$$$::It's quiet here.[lr]::
66432::$$$message_0614_0019_0004$$$::For the last few days, the town has become as quiet as ruins,[lr]::
66433::$$$message_0614_0019_0005$$$::sinking into a still slumber once night falls.::
66434::$$$message_0614_0020_0000$$$::And yet...[lr]::
66435::$$$message_0614_0020_0001$$$::The silence tonight is beyond anything I've experienced so far.::
66436::$$$message_0614_0021_0000$$$::"...Hey. Yesterday, was it like that over there? All of the streetlights are dark, not to mention the houses."::
66437::$$$message_0614_0022_0000$$$::Tohsaka is squinting in the direction of Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
66438::$$$message_0614_0022_0001$$$::It's a part of town on the opposite side of Shinto, just short of the edge of the city.[lr]::
66439::$$$message_0614_0022_0002$$$::The streets there are completely dark. From here, it's like staring into a black wall.::
66440::$$$message_0614_0023_0000$$$::"...Let's go."[lr]::
66441::$$$message_0614_0023_0001$$$::That's all I say as I begin walking toward the darkened streets.[lr]::
66442::$$$message_0614_0023_0002$$$::Tohsaka remains silent.[lr]::
66443::$$$message_0614_0023_0003$$$::...It's probably the obvious choice for her, too.[lr]::
66444::$$$message_0614_0023_0004$$$::We both know what's happening there.[lr]::
66445::$$$message_0614_0023_0005$$$::It's a contradiction.[lr]::
66446::$$$message_0614_0023_0006$$$::We know exactly what we'll find if we go there, and yet we go anyway, hoping we're completely wrong.::
66447::$$$message_0614_0024_0000$$$::"...Ngh."[lr]::
66448::$$$message_0614_0024_0001$$$::What exactly did I feel when I laid eyes on it?[lr]::
66449::$$$message_0614_0024_0002$$$::This dark wall, with nothing beyond it.[lr]::
66450::$$$message_0614_0024_0003$$$::The instant I step through it and see the town I know, I understand what's occurred.::
66451::$$$message_0614_0025_0000$$$::The town is too quiet.[lr]::
66452::$$$message_0614_0025_0001$$$::"Sleeping" isn't enough to describe it.[lr]::
66453::$$$message_0614_0025_0002$$$::This is a complete void without any sign of human life.[lr]::
66454::$$$message_0614_0025_0003$$$::It's the utter stillness of death, not slumber, when nothing is living anymore.::
66455::$$$message_0614_0026_0000$$$::I feel dizzy.[lr]::
66456::$$$message_0614_0026_0001$$$::The town hasn't changed.[lr]::
66457::$$$message_0614_0026_0002$$$::Around us...fifty or so houses are as black as night, looking exactly the same.::
66458::$$$message_0614_0027_0000$$$::There's no signs of their doors being forced.[lr]::
66459::$$$message_0614_0027_0001$$$::Nothing broke any windows to get in.[lr]::
66460::$$$message_0614_0027_0002$$$::Of course, no crane peeled off the walls and roofs to get at what's inside.[lr]::
66461::$$$message_0614_0027_0003$$$::In the same way,[lr]::
66462::$$$message_0614_0027_0004$$$::the presence of over a hundred residents is simply absent.::
66463::$$$message_0614_0028_0000$$$::"...Emiya. Let's try going into that house."[lr]::
66464::$$$message_0614_0028_0001$$$::Tohsaka puts on some gloves and breaks into a nearby house.[lr]::
66465::$$$message_0614_0028_0002$$$::We pass by the nameplate.[lr]::
66466::$$$message_0614_0028_0003$$$::We open the front door.[lr]::
66467::$$$message_0614_0028_0004$$$::We walk down the hall.[lr]::
66468::$$$message_0614_0028_0005$$$::We explore the first floor, check the second floor, find absolutely nothing, and leave.::
66469::$$$message_0614_0029_0000$$$::"...What about the people in the blacked-out houses?"[lr]::
66470::$$$message_0614_0029_0001$$$::Tohsaka tells me that they're gone.[lr]::
66471::$$$message_0614_0029_0002$$$::The town looks as it always does at night.[lr]::
66472::$$$message_0614_0029_0003$$$::The buildings are completely intact, and there aren't any dead bodies.[lr]::
66473::$$$message_0614_0029_0004$$$::It's perfectly clean, and nobody will notice anything off once dawn breaks.[lr]::
66474::$$$message_0614_0029_0005$$$::And yet...[lr]::
66475::$$$message_0614_0029_0006$$$::It looked even more barren than back then.::
66476::$$$message_0614_0030_0000$$$::We checked a few more houses, but our findings were exactly the same.[lr]::
66477::$$$message_0614_0030_0001$$$::There was no damage to any of the buildings, and no people inside.[lr]::
66478::$$$message_0614_0030_0002$$$::All they left behind were some traces of magical energy that made my chest ache.[lr]::
66479::$$$message_0614_0030_0003$$$::On every single building, road, and patch of ground,[lr]::
66480::$$$message_0614_0030_0004$$$::we found dark traces of something stuck to them, that keeps its shape and color even now.[lr]::
66481::$$$message_0614_0030_0005$$$::We knew even without saying anything that it was the cause of this pristine tragedy.::
66482::$$$message_0614_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66483::$$$message_0614_0031_0001$$$::I feel dizzy.[lr]::
66484::$$$message_0614_0031_0002$$$::I'm irritatingly nauseous.[lr]::
66485::$$$message_0614_0031_0003$$$::Corpses without bodies.[lr]::
66486::$$$message_0614_0031_0004$$$::Bleeding without blood.[lr]::
66487::$$$message_0614_0031_0005$$$::An uninhabited neighborhood, devoured by shadow.[lr]::
66488::$$$message_0614_0031_0006$$$::While I walk through it all, on edge,[lr]::
66489::$$$message_0614_0031_0007$$$::a completely unrelated image comes to mind, for some reason.::
66490::$$$message_0614_0032_0000$$$::...But it isn't unrelated.[lr]::
66491::$$$message_0614_0032_0001$$$::It can't be, if I'm thinking of it here.[lr]::
66492::$$$message_0614_0032_0002$$$::"...Stop."[lr]::
66493::$$$message_0614_0032_0003$$$::Remember. Remember.[lr]::
66494::$$$message_0614_0032_0004$$$::You know this presence, this scent.::
66495::$$$message_0614_0033_0000$$$::You did before, too.[lr]::
66496::$$$message_0614_0033_0001$$$::What did you imagine the first time you laid eyes on that abomination?[lr]::
66497::$$$message_0614_0033_0002$$$::"...Don't notice it."[lr]::
66498::$$$message_0614_0033_0003$$$::It's the same.[lr]::
66499::$$$message_0614_0033_0004$$$::No, something even heavier attacked everyone here.::
66500::$$$message_0614_0034_0000$$$::"...It's not true."[lr]::
66501::$$$message_0614_0034_0001$$$::It was the same.[lr]::
66502::$$$message_0614_0034_0002$$$::Why did you imagine what you saw[lr]::
66503::$$$message_0614_0034_0003$$$::back then?::
66504::$$$message_0614_0035_0000$$$::"Because..."::
66505::$$$message_0614_0036_0000$$$::I have no proof.[lr]::
66506::$$$message_0614_0036_0001$$$::I have no reason.[lr]::
66507::$$$message_0614_0036_0002$$$::I have no motive.[lr]::
66508::$$$message_0614_0036_0003$$$::I have no evidence.::
66509::$$$message_0614_0037_0000$$$::"...It doesn't look like anyone."::
66510::$$$message_0614_0038_0000$$$::It shouldn't be true.[lr]::
66511::$$$message_0614_0038_0001$$$::It [font italic=true]can't[font italic=false] be true.[lr]::
66512::$$$message_0614_0038_0002$$$::I must not acknowledge it.[lr]::
66513::$$$message_0614_0038_0003$$$::But the more I think...::
66514::$$$message_0614_0039_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"If I become a bad person..."[font italic=false]::
66515::$$$message_0614_0040_0000$$$::I don't have any proof at all, but my mind tells me this hunch is true.[lr]::
66516::$$$message_0614_0040_0001$$$::I know it is, because that sensation was...::
66517::$$$message_0614_0041_0000$$$::"...Stop. Don't think these stupid thoughts."::
66518::$$$message_0614_0042_0000$$$::Too similar to my nightmares of       .::
66519::$$$message_0614_0043_0000$$$::"Shirou? Why'd you stop? Is there anything else you wanted to check out?"[lr]::
66520::$$$message_0614_0043_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
66521::$$$message_0614_0043_0002$$$::I shake my head and get rid of the dizziness.[lr]::
66522::$$$message_0614_0043_0003$$$::...I must have gotten a whiff of the scent the Shadow left behind.::
66523::$$$message_0614_0044_0000$$$::"No, I just got nauseous. Don't mind me and keep talking, Tohsaka."[lr]::
66524::$$$message_0614_0044_0001$$$::"Really? ...Darn it, its residue still affects you, even after I increased your Magic Resistance.[lr]::
66525::$$$message_0614_0044_0002$$$::...I guess that's to be expected, given that it's a massive blob of magical energy. It wouldn't be able to eat an entire town if it wasn't."::
66526::$$$message_0614_0045_0000$$$::"Ah... No, that's not why I'm feeling tired. I was just feeling literally disgusted."[lr]::
66527::$$$message_0614_0045_0001$$$::Tohsaka seems to accept that.[lr]::
66528::$$$message_0614_0045_0002$$$::More importantly, we need to confirm what happened here.::
66529::$$$message_0614_0046_0000$$$::"...So, what happened over there, anyway."[lr]::
66530::$$$message_0614_0046_0001$$$::"...Pretty much the same meal as before. It's just on a different scale now.[lr]::
66531::$$$message_0614_0046_0002$$$::Before, I wouldn't have expected to find its muddy dregs on each and every house. It must have covered the entire area like a tsunami and melted into the ground. It must have been so hungry it wanted to eat them all in one bite."::
66532::$$$message_0614_0047_0000$$$::"It doesn't seem to have a taste for inorganic things, though. It ignored everything that wasn't alive, and digested every living thing without leaving a trace.[lr]::
66533::$$$message_0614_0047_0001$$$::...The only mercy was that it happened instantly. They wouldn't have had time to feel any pain or fear."::
66534::$$$message_0614_0048_0000$$$::A Bounded Field of dissolution.[lr]::
66535::$$$message_0614_0048_0001$$$::Tohsaka explains that the Bounded Field Rider deployed at the school was like magecraft with an instantaneous and powerful effect.::
66536::$$$message_0614_0049_0000$$$::"The problem is that I didn't sense any magical energy even though such a large spell was activated.[lr]::
66537::$$$message_0614_0049_0001$$$::...If the Shadow did this, then this isn't its 'magecraft', but its innate behavior. Meaning that a dissolution of this size is no different than tossing and turning in bed for that thing."::
66538::$$$message_0614_0050_0000$$$::...I see.[lr]::
66539::$$$message_0614_0050_0001$$$::But it's over now.[lr]::
66540::$$$message_0614_0050_0002$$$::The Shadow disappeared somewhere once it satisfied its hunger, and we have no reason to pursue it now.::
66541::$$$message_0614_0051_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66542::$$$message_0614_0051_0001$$$::Our patrols have lost their purpose.[lr]::
66543::$$$message_0614_0051_0002$$$::There were new victims despite our efforts, and we can't even detect the Shadow who's the key culprit.[lr]::
66544::$$$message_0614_0051_0003$$$::Whether it was the Shadow or Zouken, I thought we might be able to get a read on their movements and run to the scene to intervene.[lr]::
66545::$$$message_0614_0051_0004$$$::But that's lost its meaning now.::
66546::$$$message_0614_0052_0000$$$::We don't have any way to track the Shadow, and more than that...[lr]::
66547::$$$message_0614_0052_0001$$$::"...I knew this already, but it's growing every day. At this pace, it'll be an unstoppable monster the next time it shows up."[lr]::
66548::$$$message_0614_0052_0002$$$::Right now, we don't have any chance of winning.::
Y
