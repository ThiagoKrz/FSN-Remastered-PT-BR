76441::$$$message_0710_0000_0000$$$::The Shadow shudders.[lr]::
76442::$$$message_0710_0000_0001$$$::The red knight is drenched in blood. Tohsaka is sitting on the ground in shock.[lr]::
76443::$$$message_0710_0000_0002$$$::Five meters away from them stands a silver-haired girl holding hands with Shirou Emiya.::
76444::$$$message_0710_0001_0000$$$::...The Shadow shudders.[lr]::
76445::$$$message_0710_0001_0001$$$::It shrinks like a withered tree, and then expands like a pufferfish.[lr]::
76446::$$$message_0710_0001_0002$$$::No, its venomous nature resembles a more wicked deep-sea creature.[lr]::
76447::$$$message_0710_0001_0003$$$::It keeps swelling, growing shamelessly and endlessly, until it covers the entire forest in deep black.::
76448::$$$message_0710_0002_0000$$$::    In an instant...[lr]::
76449::$$$message_0710_0002_0001$$$::The red knight dies protecting Rin Tohsaka, and Shirou Emiya is saved by sheer luck.[lr]::
76450::$$$message_0710_0002_0002$$$::He was fortunate that the forest terrain is filled with crags and valleys.[lr]::
76451::$$$message_0710_0002_0003$$$::Shirou Emiya evaded the Shadow in a ditch.[lr]::
76452::$$$message_0710_0002_0004$$$::But his exposed left arm was not so lucky...::
76453::$$$message_0710_0003_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
76454::$$$message_0710_0003_0001$$$::She awakens from a dream.[lr]::
76455::$$$message_0710_0003_0002$$$::It's been half a day since she sent Rider to protect Shirou.[lr]::
76456::$$$message_0710_0003_0003$$$::Sakura had been sharing her Servant's perception so that she could keep an eye on things from the Emiya house. The shocking scene jolted her back to reality.::
76457::$$$message_0710_0004_0000$$$::"Hah...ah, ugh...!"::
76458::$$$message_0710_0005_0000$$$::She feels nauseous.[lr]::
76459::$$$message_0710_0005_0001$$$::She's hit by the vertigo of suddenly severing her senses from that of her Servant.[lr]::
76460::$$$message_0710_0005_0002$$$::Her sleeping body is covered in sweat, and if she even tries to breathe, she suddenly[line2][lr]::
76461::$$$message_0710_0005_0003$$$::"Ugh...hah...!"[lr]::
76462::$$$message_0710_0005_0004$$$::The contents of her stomach rise to her throat.::
76463::$$$message_0710_0006_0000$$$::She runs to the changing room.[lr]::
76464::$$$message_0710_0006_0001$$$::Clinging to the sink, she covers her mouth with her hand, not breathing.[lr]::
76465::$$$message_0710_0006_0002$$$::"Ugh...urgh...!"[lr]::
76466::$$$message_0710_0006_0003$$$::She can't contain the bile in her chest, and it spills out.::
76467::$$$message_0710_0007_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
76468::$$$message_0710_0007_0001$$$::Her shoulders heave up and down.[lr]::
76469::$$$message_0710_0007_0002$$$::Her long hair sways like a curtain, concealing her face from the mirror.::
76470::$$$message_0710_0008_0000$$$::"It can't be... Senpai's hand..."[lr]::
76471::$$$message_0710_0008_0001$$$::She recalls the nightmare with horror.[lr]::
76472::$$$message_0710_0008_0002$$$::...Those images were real.[lr]::
76473::$$$message_0710_0008_0003$$$::Shirou Emiya protected the silver-haired girl, and the Shadow swallowed his arm.[lr]::
76474::$$$message_0710_0008_0004$$$::It was devoured down to its socket.::
76475::$$$message_0710_0009_0000$$$::"What...have I done..."[lr]::
76476::$$$message_0710_0009_0001$$$::Sakura berates herself, as if she's thought something she shouldn't have.[lr]::
76477::$$$message_0710_0009_0002$$$::She feels both chills and a strange sense of exultation, and can't quite process what happened or what she should do next.[lr]::
76478::$$$message_0710_0009_0003$$$::All she knows for sure is that she hates herself.[lr]::
76479::$$$message_0710_0009_0004$$$::Before, she had a similar invasive thought: [lr]::
76480::$$$message_0710_0009_0005$$$::If she injured Shirou Emiya so that he couldn't go outside, then he wouldn't be in danger anymore.::
76481::$$$message_0710_0010_0000$$$::"No...that's wrong."[lr]::
76482::$$$message_0710_0010_0001$$$::Yes, it was wrong.[lr]::
76483::$$$message_0710_0010_0002$$$::It wouldn't solve anything.[lr]::
76484::$$$message_0710_0010_0003$$$::How fickle of her to wish that he'd get hurt enough not to go outside.[lr]::
76485::$$$message_0710_0010_0004$$$::And now, she'd hurt Shirou Emiya in a way that had nothing to do with her wish.[lr]::
76486::$$$message_0710_0010_0005$$$::His life was in danger, never mind his ability to leave the house.::
76487::$$$message_0710_0011_0000$$$::Both of these things actually happened.[lr]::
76488::$$$message_0710_0011_0001$$$::That was what it really meant to hurt him.[lr]::
76489::$$$message_0710_0011_0002$$$::How could she have wished for something so awful?::
76490::$$$message_0710_0012_0000$$$::"Urgh... Argh, ugh, ah...!"[lr]::
76491::$$$message_0710_0012_0001$$$::The nausea won't go away.[lr]::
76492::$$$message_0710_0012_0002$$$::She's already vomited everything in her stomach, but the retching won't stop.[lr]::
76493::$$$message_0710_0012_0003$$$::Blood and bile.[lr]::
76494::$$$message_0710_0012_0004$$$::It's almost as if the mangling pain in her stomach and the searing in her throat are meant to punish her, she thinks to herself.::
76495::$$$message_0710_0013_0000$$$::...Several dozen minutes pass.[lr]::
76496::$$$message_0710_0013_0001$$$::After running out of even her stomach bile, the nausea passes, and she finally regains her composure.[lr]::
76497::$$$message_0710_0013_0002$$$::She pants roughly.[lr]::
76498::$$$message_0710_0013_0003$$$::Her shoulders heave, her breathing ragged.[lr]::
76499::$$$message_0710_0013_0004$$$::She grips the sink in both hands, trying to catch her breath like she's just finished running a marathon.[lr]::
76500::$$$message_0710_0013_0005$$$::"...Now Senpai can't fight anymore."[lr]::
76501::$$$message_0710_0013_0006$$$::Her honest feelings slip out in a rapturous tone.::
76502::$$$message_0710_0014_0000$$$::It's a short whisper.[lr]::
76503::$$$message_0710_0014_0001$$$::Disheveled and winded, she looks up.[lr]::
76504::$$$message_0710_0014_0002$$$::The image of her in the mirror is weighed down by guilt.[lr]::
76505::$$$message_0710_0014_0003$$$::She looks downcast and worried for Shirou Emiya's welfare.[lr]::
76506::$$$message_0710_0014_0004$$$::She sincerely and earnestly wishes for his safety.[lr]::
76507::$$$message_0710_0014_0005$$$::The mirror reflects her crooked grin.::
