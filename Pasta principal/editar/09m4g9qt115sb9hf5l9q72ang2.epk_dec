74868::$$$message_0688_0000_0000$$$::    She is left alone.[lr]::
74869::$$$message_0688_0000_0001$$$::There is no longer any meaning in the boy's war.[lr]::
74870::$$$message_0688_0000_0002$$$::No longer a Master, he charges off into danger anyway. Meanwhile, the girl who is the cause of it all is resting at home.[lr]::
74871::$$$message_0688_0000_0003$$$::The reality sinks in.::
74872::$$$message_0688_0001_0000$$$::"He's gone to the forest... Do you regret this, Sakura?"[lr]::
74873::$$$message_0688_0001_0001$$$::The servant inquires her master's feelings.[lr]::
74874::$$$message_0688_0001_0002$$$::Eyes gloomy, the girl shakes her head once.::
74875::$$$message_0688_0002_0000$$$::"...How could I feel regret now, after all this time, Rider?"[lr]::
74876::$$$message_0688_0002_0001$$$::"Yes. It was a pointless question."[lr]::
74877::$$$message_0688_0002_0002$$$::"Yeah. But while it does hurt... I know it's wrong to feel this way, but I'm also very happy to know that Senpai is doing all this for my sake."[lr]::
74878::$$$message_0688_0002_0003$$$::Even as she says it, pain fills her expression.[lr]::
74879::$$$message_0688_0002_0004$$$::Her lips feel practically sewn together by her guilt, even as she speaks of joy.::
74880::$$$message_0688_0003_0000$$$::"But he's making a mistake. Grandfather won't show any mercy. Senpai could always get killed as long as he's out there fighting.[lr]::
74881::$$$message_0688_0003_0001$$$::Worst of all, though..."[lr]::
74882::$$$message_0688_0003_0002$$$::It'll be a problem for her if she lets him get involved any further.[lr]::
74883::$$$message_0688_0003_0003$$$::The future holds nothing good for either of them.::
74884::$$$message_0688_0004_0000$$$::That's why she hoped he would give up on the war and go back to their normal life.[lr]::
74885::$$$message_0688_0004_0001$$$::She doesn't have much time left, anyway.[lr]::
74886::$$$message_0688_0004_0002$$$::She'd prefer to live the rest of it for him.[lr]::
74887::$$$message_0688_0004_0003$$$::However...[lr]::
74888::$$$message_0688_0004_0004$$$::Beneath that desire, she feels a glimmer of hope,[lr]::
74889::$$$message_0688_0004_0005$$$::that his fighting might allow them to be together longer.[lr]::
74890::$$$message_0688_0004_0006$$$::No, she's simply delighted to see that her beloved is fighting and getting hurt on her behalf.::
74891::$$$message_0688_0005_0000$$$::She doesn't want him to fight.[lr]::
74892::$$$message_0688_0005_0001$$$::But she's overjoyed that he's doing it for her.[lr]::
74893::$$$message_0688_0005_0002$$$::Two competing wishes vie for her heart, and she's stuck unable to decide which one matters more.::
74894::$$$message_0688_0006_0000$$$::"...That's a lie. I'm not on the fence at all."[lr]::
74895::$$$message_0688_0006_0001$$$::She mumbles in anguish, keenly aware of her own dark nature.[lr]::
74896::$$$message_0688_0006_0002$$$::That's right.[lr]::
74897::$$$message_0688_0006_0003$$$::Actually, she wants him to fight. She wants him to save her. To make up for all the time during which he had never noticed her.[lr]::
74898::$$$message_0688_0006_0004$$$::So...it's all right if he gets hurt.[lr]::
74899::$$$message_0688_0006_0005$$$::She's thinking something she never should.::
74900::$$$message_0688_0007_0000$$$::"Hah, khh...!"[lr]::
74901::$$$message_0688_0007_0001$$$::She clutches her chest in pain.[lr]::
74902::$$$message_0688_0007_0002$$$::The worms inside her wriggle up and down her nerves, as if responding to her dark desires.[lr]::
74903::$$$message_0688_0007_0003$$$::...It was only an instant.[lr]::
74904::$$$message_0688_0007_0004$$$::That single thought of him getting hurt is enough to make the worms violate her body even more.::
74905::$$$message_0688_0008_0000$$$::Wriggle, wriggle.[lr]::
74906::$$$message_0688_0008_0001$$$::Wriggle, wriggle.[lr]::
74907::$$$message_0688_0008_0002$$$::Wriggle, wriggle, wriggle.[lr]::
74908::$$$message_0688_0008_0003$$$::All their squirming in her body starts to make her ears ring.[lr]::
74909::$$$message_0688_0008_0004$$$::A chill runs through her blood.[lr]::
74910::$$$message_0688_0008_0005$$$::My body is so disgusting, so wicked, to be aroused by something like this.[l][r]::
74911::$$$message_0688_0008_0006$$$::...The worms that dissolved in her blood become a sweet poison, heating her body.[lr]::
74912::$$$message_0688_0008_0007$$$::They swell and roil like waves, swallowing her consciousness.[lr]::
74913::$$$message_0688_0008_0008$$$::When she gets aroused like this, she always thinks: ::
74914::$$$message_0688_0009_0000$$$::These defiled arms and legs can't be human.[lr]::
74915::$$$message_0688_0009_0001$$$::The dark longing makes her stumble, and she tumbles to the ground in a tangle of hair and limbs.[lr]::
74916::$$$message_0688_0009_0002$$$::She can't stop breathing. Her spine fuses together like sticky sap.[lr]::
74917::$$$message_0688_0009_0003$$$::It's no different from the things attached to her nerves.[lr]::
74918::$$$message_0688_0009_0004$$$::The more she tries to resist them, the deeper the worms invade her nerves, melting her mind away, until...[lr]::
74919::$$$message_0688_0009_0005$$$::    She feels like she's become a worm.[lr]::
74920::$$$message_0688_0009_0006$$$::The ominous vision grips her entire body.::
74921::$$$message_0688_0010_0000$$$::"Sakura."[lr]::
74922::$$$message_0688_0010_0001$$$::"...I'm fine. I'm still all right. More importantly, I have a favor to ask, Rider. Please go with Senpai."[lr]::
74923::$$$message_0688_0010_0002$$$::"...I'll go if you if you order it. But Sakura, your body will not last much longer. Having me act will only shorten your remaining life. Are you sure about this?"::
74924::$$$message_0688_0011_0000$$$::"...Yeah. It's because I don't have much time left.[lr]::
74925::$$$message_0688_0011_0001$$$::I'm still myself now, but if I lose focus, I don't know what I'll do... My memories are getting more vague each day, and I can't feel my arms and legs anymore. My sense of time is all over the place, and I can't even keep track of a day anymore.[lr]::
74926::$$$message_0688_0011_0002$$$::...Even this morning, when I watched Senpai leave, it felt like a whole week went by."::
74927::$$$message_0688_0012_0000$$$::She says it as if it doesn't particularly bother her.[lr]::
74928::$$$message_0688_0012_0001$$$::...She's already accepted her death.[lr]::
74929::$$$message_0688_0012_0002$$$::Even as she tries not to shamefully cling to hope, she wants to protect him.::
74930::$$$message_0688_0013_0000$$$::"...I understand. By your command, I will guard Shirou Emiya."[lr]::
74931::$$$message_0688_0013_0001$$$::"Thanks, and sorry, Rider. If I'm not good anymore, find someone new to contract with right away. I'd...rather it not be Senpai, but I guess it's all right if it's you."[lr]::
74932::$$$message_0688_0013_0002$$$::She forces herself to smile.[lr]::
74933::$$$message_0688_0013_0003$$$::The black-clad Servant nods once and leaves her Master.::
74934::$$$message_0688_0014_0000$$$::"...This is an ill breeze. I will need to use my Noble Phantasm, if you don't mind."[lr]::
74935::$$$message_0688_0014_0001$$$::"Yeah. If Senpai's in danger, bring him home."[lr]::
74936::$$$message_0688_0014_0002$$$::"I know. But Sakura...[lr]::
74937::$$$message_0688_0014_0003$$$::I think we should be more cautious of that priest than the old man."[lr]::
74938::$$$message_0688_0014_0004$$$::Rider leaves with that last remark.::
74939::$$$message_0688_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74940::$$$message_0688_0015_0001$$$::That was a surprise.[lr]::
74941::$$$message_0688_0015_0002$$$::Her Servant doesn't give her opinions. She has a stoic personality and carries out orders exactly as they're given.[lr]::
74942::$$$message_0688_0015_0003$$$::Until now, she's never made so much as a suggestion.::
74943::$$$message_0688_0016_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I think so, too."[lr]::
74944::$$$message_0688_0016_0001$$$::A singsong whisper.[lr]::
74945::$$$message_0688_0016_0002$$$::A languid, even graceful expression replaces her earlier gloom.[lr]::
74946::$$$message_0688_0016_0003$$$::"But don't worry, Rider.[lr]::
74947::$$$message_0688_0016_0004$$$::He can't beat me."[lr]::
74948::$$$message_0688_0016_0005$$$::She giggles,[lr]::
74949::$$$message_0688_0016_0006$$$::like a girl picking flowers.:‡√ã
