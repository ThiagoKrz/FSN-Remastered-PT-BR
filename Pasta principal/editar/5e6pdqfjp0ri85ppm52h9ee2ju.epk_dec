51269::$$$message_0442_0000_0000$$$::Club practice ends by the time the sun sets.[lr]::
51270::$$$message_0442_0000_0001$$$::The sun goes down early in winter, and they must be taking into account the incidents that have been happening lately. ::
51271::$$$message_0442_0001_0000$$$::"Oh yeah Mitsuzuri, where is Shinji? I haven't seen him."[lr]::
51272::$$$message_0442_0001_0001$$$::"He's ditching. Maybe he got a girlfriend, but he's been like that recently."[lr]::
51273::$$$message_0442_0001_0002$$$::Mitsuzuri says it as if it's nothing and makes her way towards the school building.::
51274::$$$message_0442_0002_0000$$$::"See you later. I have some business at the teacher's office."[lr]::
51275::$$$message_0442_0002_0001$$$::The kyudo captain leaves, fiddling with the room key.::
51276::$$$message_0442_0003_0000$$$::   We're at the front gate.[lr]::
51277::$$$message_0442_0003_0001$$$::With the sun setting on the town below us, I part with the others along with Fuji-nee, Sakura, and Saber.::
51278::$$$message_0442_0004_0000$$$::"Bye, Ms. Fujimura!"[lr]::
51279::$$$message_0442_0004_0001$$$::"Don't bully Emiya, Taiga!"[lr]::
51280::$$$message_0442_0004_0002$$$::Everyone sees us off in high spirits as we start down the hill.::
51281::$$$message_0442_0005_0000$$$::We descend back into town.[lr]::
51282::$$$message_0442_0005_0001$$$::Beside me are Sakura and Fuji-nee, and Saber follows slightly behind us.::
51283::$$$message_0442_0006_0000$$$::"...Huh? Why is that girl following us?"[lr]::
51284::$$$message_0442_0006_0001$$$::Well...[lr]::
51285::$$$message_0442_0006_0002$$$::It seems as though she didn't think anything of it at the time, but is finally catching on.::
51286::$$$message_0442_0007_0000$$$::"Hey, Shirou. Do you know her?"[lr]::
51287::$$$message_0442_0007_0001$$$::This is the second time someone's asked me today. Thanks to Mitsuzuri for giving me a rehearsal, I'm able to answer without hesitation.[lr]::
51288::$$$message_0442_0007_0002$$$::"Of course I know her. I'm the one who brought her."[lr]::
51289::$$$message_0442_0007_0003$$$::I answered as nonchalantly as I can.::
51290::$$$message_0442_0008_0000$$$::"T-that's what I thought... So, Senpai, how do you know her...?"[lr]::
51291::$$$message_0442_0008_0001$$$::"Yeah. I didn't know you had a foreign friend."::
51292::$$$message_0442_0009_0000$$$::"Well, not a friend, but she's an acquaintance of my father. She's the daughter of someone my old man met when he was flying around the world."[lr]::
51293::$$$message_0442_0009_0001$$$::"Kiritsugu's? So she came to visit Kiritsugu?"::
51294::$$$message_0442_0010_0000$$$::"That's right. She'll be staying at my place for a while, so please do your best to be accommodating."[lr]::
51295::$$$message_0442_0010_0001$$$::"...What?"::
51296::$$$message_0442_0011_0000$$$::Both Sakura and Fuji-nee react in the same way at the exact same time.[lr]::
51297::$$$message_0442_0011_0001$$$::Well, if I was told "that girl will start living with you today," then it would be weirder to not be surprised.::
51298::$$$message_0442_0012_0000$$$::"Wai[line2]S-Shirou, are you saying you're going to be living with her...!?"::
51299::$$$message_0442_0013_0000$$$::"No, Saber is only staying for a short while. I'm just giving her a place to stay. It's nothing to be so shocked by."::
51300::$$$message_0442_0014_0000$$$::"...Um. Senpai, is her name Saber...?"::
51301::$$$message_0442_0015_0000$$$::"Yeah, it's a rare name. She's not used to Japan, so she might act differently... Oh, also she seems unapproachable, but she's actually really nice. Sakura, it would be helpful if you could be friends with her."::
51302::$$$message_0442_0016_0000$$$::"...Okay. That's fine, but..."[lr]::
51303::$$$message_0442_0016_0001$$$::Sakura doesn't make eye contact with me and looks at Fuji-nee as if pleading for help.::
51304::$$$message_0442_0017_0000$$$::"Ms. Fujimura. Do you approve of Saber staying over?"::
51305::$$$message_0442_0018_0000$$$::"Hmm... I can't approve of it as a teacher, but I can't ignore someone who came for Kiritsugu... She looks responsible, so I don't think anything will happen. Right, Shirou?"[lr]::
51306::$$$message_0442_0018_0001$$$::She gives me a sidelong glance.::
51307::$$$message_0442_0019_0000$$$::"O-of course. Kiritsugu's guest is my guest. I'm not gonna be rude to her. If anything, she's like a little sister."[lr]::
51308::$$$message_0442_0019_0001$$$::"Hmm. By the way, how old is she? She looks younger than Sakura."::
51309::$$$message_0442_0020_0000$$$::"Huh? Um, well...something like that."[lr]::
51310::$$$message_0442_0020_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
51311::$$$message_0442_0020_0002$$$::Fuji-nee stares into my face.[lr]::
51312::$$$message_0442_0020_0003$$$::And, as we're at the bottom of the hill, suddenly...::
51313::$$$message_0442_0021_0000$$$::                                          "Shirou, do you like her?"::
51314::$$$message_0442_0022_0000$$$::Surprise attack.::
51315::$$$message_0442_0023_0000$$$::"Nnn...! I-I don't know her! I just met her, so I can't say!"[lr]::
51316::$$$message_0442_0023_0001$$$::...Ugh, my face is hot... I bet my face looks red to Fuji-nee right now.::
51317::$$$message_0442_0024_0000$$$::"Hm. You're not lying, but the possibility isn't zero."[lr]::
51318::$$$message_0442_0024_0001$$$::I don't know what she got from that.[lr]::
51319::$$$message_0442_0024_0002$$$::Fuji-nee crosses her arms and goes quiet, as if she's thinking hard about something.::
51320::$$$message_0442_0025_0000$$$::As a result, Saber's stay was approved.::
51321::$$$message_0442_0026_0000$$$::"I guess it's fine. It'll be a good experience if you think of it as a homestay, and there's a lot of empty rooms here."::
51322::$$$message_0442_0027_0000$$$::Fuji-nee's single opinion settles it.[lr]::
51323::$$$message_0442_0027_0001$$$::Sakura didn't say anything the whole time, but in the end...[lr]::
51324::$$$message_0442_0027_0002$$$::"Yeah, and I don't feel like I have a say in this."[lr]::
51325::$$$message_0442_0027_0003$$$::She agreed in the end.::
51326::$$$message_0442_0028_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
51327::$$$message_0442_0028_0001$$$::And so, dinnertime rolls around.[lr]::
51328::$$$message_0442_0028_0002$$$::I put in extra effort into making dinner to welcome Saber.::
51329::$$$message_0442_0029_0000$$$::Starting with preparing salad-style seared bonito, then fried chicken with a zesty green onion sauce, a classic meat and potato stew, and to top it off, a variety of tempura including shrimp.[lr]::
51330::$$$message_0442_0029_0001$$$::The menu is kind of all over the place, but...::
51331::$$$message_0442_0030_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
51332::$$$message_0442_0030_0001$$$::It ended without anyone saying anything.::
51333::$$$message_0442_0031_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
51334::$$$message_0442_0031_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Splish splash.[font italic=false][lr]::
51335::$$$message_0442_0031_0002$$$::I wash the dishes in the kitchen.[lr]::
51336::$$$message_0442_0031_0003$$$::Not that I expected everyone to be the best of friends from day one, but couldn't there have been a bit more conversation?::
51337::$$$message_0442_0032_0000$$$::I think I made the tempura especially good this time.[lr]::
51338::$$$message_0442_0032_0001$$$::It's straight instead of curved, and the outside is crunchy.[lr]::
51339::$$$message_0442_0032_0002$$$::It was perfectly made, so they could have at least said something.::
51340::$$$message_0442_0033_0000$$$::"...They still finished everything. What's up with just 'more, please' repeated three times being the only thing said?"[lr]::
51341::$$$message_0442_0033_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Splish splash.[font italic=false][lr]::
51342::$$$message_0442_0033_0002$$$::Cleaning up after four people takes a while.[lr]::
51343::$$$message_0442_0033_0003$$$::...Now that I think about it, is Sakura protesting the situation by not helping today of all days?::
51344::$$$message_0442_0034_0000$$$::It's past 9 PM.[lr]::
51345::$$$message_0442_0034_0001$$$::They usually go home around this time.::
51346::$$$message_0442_0035_0000$$$::"Fuji-nee. If you're going home, can you see Sakura off?"[lr]::
51347::$$$message_0442_0035_0001$$$::I call out from the kitchen while washing the dishes.[lr]::
51348::$$$message_0442_0035_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51349::$$$message_0442_0035_0003$$$::There is no response.[lr]::
51350::$$$message_0442_0035_0004$$$::Fuji-nee is watching TV, as if it's not her concern.::
51351::$$$message_0442_0036_0000$$$::"...Hello? Earth to Ms. Fujimura?"[lr]::
51352::$$$message_0442_0036_0001$$$::I go to the living room and tap on her head.[lr]::
51353::$$$message_0442_0036_0002$$$::Then...[lr]::
51354::$$$message_0442_0036_0003$$$::"Sorry, but no dice. I won't be able to take Sakura home for a while."::
51355::$$$message_0442_0037_0000$$$::"...Mm? Why? Do you have to do something, Fuji-nee?"[lr]::
51356::$$$message_0442_0037_0001$$$::"Ehh, nah. I'll be staying here starting tonight, too."[lr]::
51357::$$$message_0442_0037_0002$$$::As if it were nothing,[lr]::
51358::$$$message_0442_0037_0003$$$::Fuji-nee makes another sneak attack on me.::
51359::$$$message_0442_0038_0000$$$::"...What?"[lr]::
51360::$$$message_0442_0038_0001$$$::"Oh, why don't you join us, Sakura? I'll contact your family, so don't worry. Wouldn't it be more fun if the three of us had a sleepover?"::
51361::$$$message_0442_0039_0000$$$::"Oh... Y-yes, please! I knew I could count on you, Ms. Fujimura!"[lr]::
51362::$$$message_0442_0039_0001$$$::Wait.[lr]::
51363::$$$message_0442_0039_0002$$$::Why are you so enthusiastic about it, Sakura?::
51364::$$$message_0442_0040_0000$$$::"All right, then let's use the room in the back! We have plenty of beds and pajamas for all of us! That's fine with you, right, Saber?"[lr]::
51365::$$$message_0442_0040_0001$$$::Is it just me or does it sound more like an order?::
51366::$$$message_0442_0041_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
51367::$$$message_0442_0041_0001$$$::Saber looks at me as if asking for help.::
51368::$$$message_0442_0042_0000$$$::"...This is troubling, Shirou. I must protect you, so I cannot fulfill my duty if I am in the same room as them. And I would not know how to interact with them either."::
51369::$$$message_0442_0043_0000$$$::"...Sorry. If Fuji-nee brought it up, I can't stop her.[lr]::
51370::$$$message_0442_0043_0001$$$::Also, she's probably doing this as a compromise.[lr]::
51371::$$$message_0442_0043_0002$$$::If we decline, she might take back letting you stay here. If that happens, we'll have to sleep elsewhere."  ::
51372::$$$message_0442_0044_0000$$$::"...That would trouble me too. The Bounded Field at this house is excellent, so this location is a good base. As long as you are here, you will be prepared for any enemy surprise attacks."::
51373::$$$message_0442_0045_0000$$$::"...I see. Then even more so, please just hang in there. As long as we're both here, we can meet up at anytime, right?[lr]::
51374::$$$message_0442_0045_0001$$$::...Um, dealing with Fuji-nee is a lot, but if you have trouble, just say you don't know Japanese."::
51375::$$$message_0442_0046_0000$$$::"Hey, stop whispering over there.[lr]::
51376::$$$message_0442_0046_0001$$$::Come over here, Saber. Shirou's a boy, so he's fine by himself, right?"[lr]::
51377::$$$message_0442_0046_0002$$$::Fuji-nee pulls Saber to her.::
51378::$$$message_0442_0047_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51379::$$$message_0442_0047_0001$$$::It's been decided.[lr]::
51380::$$$message_0442_0047_0002$$$::Saber's stay got approved, Fuji-nee is staying over, and Sakura is keeping them company too.[lr]::
51381::$$$message_0442_0047_0003$$$::In only half a day, the occupancy has drastically increased.[lr]::
51382::$$$message_0442_0047_0004$$$::...Hmm, actually, this really is comparable to a hotel.“þ
