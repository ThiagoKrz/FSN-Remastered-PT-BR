58132::$$$message_0520_0000_0002$$$::"...Hh..."[lr]::
58133::$$$message_0520_0000_0003$$$::Sticky blood coats his lips.[lr]::
58134::$$$message_0520_0000_0004$$$::A man falls to his knees on the stone steps, bidding farewell to his long sword as it sinks into the darkness.::
58135::$$$message_0520_0001_0000$$$::He will never pick up that sword again.[lr]::
58136::$$$message_0520_0001_0001$$$::His coat is stained in blood, its newly dyed threads making it resemble a gallant, crimson flower.::
58137::$$$message_0520_0002_0000$$$::"To think...that I'd meet my end...at the hands of some detestable fiend..."[lr]::
58138::$$$message_0520_0002_0001$$$::The man's lips seem like white bone in contrast to the fresh blood spilling from his belly.[lr]::
58139::$$$message_0520_0002_0002$$$::The vital tremble of life has already left his throat.[lr]::
58140::$$$message_0520_0002_0003$$$::Sasaki Kojirou's innards are already functioning as something [font italic=true]else[font italic=false].::
58141::$$$message_0520_0003_0000$$$::The mountain gate is quiet.[lr]::
58142::$$$message_0520_0003_0001$$$::Neither the Servant guarding it[lr]::

58145::$$$message_0520_0003_0004$$$::   The battle is already over.[lr]::
58146::$$$message_0520_0003_0005$$$::Whatever just swiftly ascended the stone steps defeated Assassin.[lr]::
58147::$$$message_0520_0003_0006$$$::There was no time to cross blades or even acknowledge the enemy.[lr]::
58148::$$$message_0520_0003_0007$$$::Whatever it was, it was in a different dimension altogether.::
58149::$$$message_0520_0004_0000$$$::The gatekeeper's body tears.[lr]::
58150::$$$message_0520_0004_0001$$$::His torso is ripped apart. Without a weapon, Assassin cannot even end his own life.[lr]::
58151::$$$message_0520_0004_0002$$$::It walks. Steadily, surely.[lr]::
58152::$$$message_0520_0004_0003$$$::The shadow lovingly, or perhaps disdainfully, strokes the cheek of the Servant called Assassin.::
58153::$$$message_0520_0005_0000$$$::A spidery, ghoulish arm erupts from his shredded torso.[lr]::
58154::$$$message_0520_0005_0001$$$::Bones entangle.[lr]::

58158::$$$message_0520_0006_0001$$$::He fights the surge of blood that threatens to burst forth.[lr]::
58159::$$$message_0520_0006_0002$$$::The swordsman swallows it down, a genial grin playing across his lips.::
58160::$$$message_0520_0007_0000$$$::"...Very well. Do as you wish. Whatever is born from my belly can surely be nothing good."[lr]::
58161::$$$message_0520_0007_0001$$$::Eaten from within and deprived of a merciful death, he smiles.[lr]::
58162::$$$message_0520_0007_0002$$$::It is a valiant gesture.[lr]::
58163::$$$message_0520_0007_0003$$$::His lurid grin is even more fearsome than the birth of the abomination within him.::

58165::$$$message_0520_0008_0001$$$::The thing born from the blood and entrails of a false Servant is, unmistakably, an Assassin.[lr]::
58166::$$$message_0520_0008_0002$$$::"Kii... Kikikikikikiii...!"[lr]::
58167::$$$message_0520_0008_0003$$$::Its birthing cries resemble the chitter of insects.[lr]::
58168::$$$message_0520_0008_0004$$$::The insect that emerges from the swordsman's body greedily devours its womb.::

58171::$$$message_0520_0009_0002$$$::With each bite of flesh, the dark insect becomes increasingly man-shaped, its unformed brain gaining human knowledge.[lr]::
58172::$$$message_0520_0009_0003$$$::The feast continues for half an hour.[lr]::
58173::$$$message_0520_0009_0004$$$::The new Assassin studiously slurps up every last drop of blood, celebrating its birth on now spotless stone steps.::
58174::$$$message_0520_0010_0000$$$::Its only witnesses are the chorally chittering swarms of insects in the brush and the bright, voluminous moon.[lr]::
58175::$$$message_0520_0010_0001$$$::The shrill birthing cries fade.::
58176::$$$message_0520_0011_0000$$$::[line4]It is an ill moon.[lr]::
