54547::$$$message_0485_0000_0000$$$::She looks up at the clock on the wall, the ticking of the second hand ringing keenly in her ears.[lr]::
54548::$$$message_0485_0000_0001$$$::The time is past 4:00 PM.[lr]::
54549::$$$message_0485_0000_0002$$$::School got out a long time ago, and it's well past the time he would've gotten home, even if he stopped for groceries.[lr]::
54550::$$$message_0485_0000_0003$$$::"...Senpai's late. I wonder why."[lr]::
54551::$$$message_0485_0000_0004$$$::She whispers dreamily, leaning against the wall.::
54552::$$$message_0485_0001_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
54553::$$$message_0485_0001_0001$$$::She moves slowly, feeling dizzy thanks to her fever.[lr]::
54554::$$$message_0485_0001_0002$$$::She's slightly surprised by her own voice.[lr]::
54555::$$$message_0485_0001_0003$$$::The clock ticking sounds so loud it grates on her ears, yet she can't hear her own voice very well.[lr]::
54556::$$$message_0485_0001_0004$$$::That simple noise alone keeps resonating in her earlobes.[lr]::
54557::$$$message_0485_0001_0005$$$::The steady [font italic=true]tick-tock[font italic=false] rhythm of the clock,[lr]::
54558::$$$message_0485_0001_0006$$$::and the [font italic=true]badump[font italic=false] of her heart, straining to pump blood.[lr]::
54559::$$$message_0485_0001_0007$$$::The two sounds get into her head even if she covers her ears, making the dizziness worse.::
54560::$$$message_0485_0002_0000$$$::"That's weird...I was sure I got over the cold."[lr]::
54561::$$$message_0485_0002_0001$$$::That's why she sent the caretaker home.[lr]::
54562::$$$message_0485_0002_0002$$$::Her temperature was normal when she measured it, and she managed to make lunch on her own.[lr]::
54563::$$$message_0485_0002_0003$$$::In the afternoon, she felt like her usual self again, and she looked forward to seeing the real master of the house come home.::
54564::$$$message_0485_0003_0000$$$::"It's hot..."[lr]::
54565::$$$message_0485_0003_0001$$$::And yet, her whole body feels hot.[lr]::
54566::$$$message_0485_0003_0002$$$::The heat isn't coming from herself, but someplace else.[lr]::
54567::$$$message_0485_0003_0003$$$::Something between her blood vessels and overlapping muscles, in gaps that shouldn't be there.[lr]::
54568::$$$message_0485_0003_0004$$$::Something other than herself penetrates deep inside, running like a car engine.[lr]::
54569::$$$message_0485_0003_0005$$$::Her fever is so hot, so endless, so unlike anything she's ever experienced before, that she can't help but visualize it as such.::
54570::$$$message_0485_0004_0000$$$::If you asked her whether it feels bizarre, whether it's uncomfortable, she'd say yes to both.[lr]::
54571::$$$message_0485_0004_0001$$$::She isn't the only one who feels suffocated.[lr]::
54572::$$$message_0485_0004_0002$$$::The things creeping between her blood vessels and nerves are having a hard time, too.[lr]::
54573::$$$message_0485_0004_0003$$$::To use an example, they're like puppies trapped in a can full of ground meat, searching for an exit.[lr]::
54574::$$$message_0485_0004_0004$$$::They're the real cause of her fever... The puppies wriggling in her body, desperately trying to fulfill their function.[lr]::
54575::$$$message_0485_0004_0005$$$::She finds them adorable somehow, and can't bring herself to hate the sensation.::
54576::$$$message_0485_0005_0000$$$::"The clock...is so loud..."[lr]::
54577::$$$message_0485_0005_0001$$$::She absently stares at the clock.[lr]::
54578::$$$message_0485_0005_0002$$$::It's now half past four.[lr]::
54579::$$$message_0485_0005_0003$$$::Just a little longer. He's sure to be home in another thirty minutes.[lr]::
54580::$$$message_0485_0005_0004$$$::Before then, she needs to calm her body down and quiet the things running throughout her body.::
54581::$$$message_0485_0006_0000$$$::"It's okay...this has happened before..."[lr]::
54582::$$$message_0485_0006_0001$$$::Yes, she's used to these symptoms. [lr]::
54583::$$$message_0485_0006_0002$$$::She's experienced them many times since childhood, and she's been taught how to relieve them.[lr]::
54584::$$$message_0485_0006_0003$$$::That's why she thinks she can calm this down. But the fever doesn't recede, and the things in her move even faster.::
54585::$$$message_0485_0007_0000$$$::"No...something's wrong...Senpai..."[lr]::
54586::$$$message_0485_0007_0001$$$::Her body won't relax.[lr]::
54587::$$$message_0485_0007_0002$$$::Everything she's tried before doesn't work.[lr]::
54588::$$$message_0485_0007_0003$$$::What is she missing? What does she need? What changed?[lr]::
54589::$$$message_0485_0007_0004$$$::She desperately tries to figure it out, but the ticking is too distracting. She can't think straight.::
54590::$$$message_0485_0008_0000$$$::"Huh...? This noise..."[lr]::
54591::$$$message_0485_0008_0001$$$::Finally, she realizes that it isn't the clock, but an alarm emitted by the house itself.[lr]::
54592::$$$message_0485_0008_0002$$$::"Well, well. Emiya isn't here. That's convenient."[lr]::
54593::$$$message_0485_0008_0003$$$::Someone familiar appears before her, tracking dirt into the house.::
54594::$$$message_0485_0009_0000$$$::"Shin...ji..."[lr]::
54595::$$$message_0485_0009_0001$$$::"Hey now, what's wrong, Sakura? What are you doing all alone without Emiya? This must be the drawback from overusing Rider."[lr]::
54596::$$$message_0485_0009_0002$$$::The man enters the living room and walks up to the girl slumped against the wall.::
54597::$$$message_0485_0010_0000$$$::"Ah."[lr]::
54598::$$$message_0485_0010_0001$$$::She can't put any strength into her muscles.[lr]::
54599::$$$message_0485_0010_0002$$$::She never had the energy to move to begin with.::
54600::$$$message_0485_0011_0000$$$::"I'm here to pick you up, Sakura. No more playing house."[lr]::
54601::$$$message_0485_0011_0001$$$::He looks down on her with a plastic smile.[lr]::
54602::$$$message_0485_0011_0002$$$::"Shinji..."[lr]::
54603::$$$message_0485_0011_0003$$$::"Let's go. I'm going to settle the score with Emiya. You want to see him too, right? I'll give you a front-row seat."[lr]::
54604::$$$message_0485_0011_0004$$$::The man grabs her arm and drags her to her feet.::
54605::$$$message_0485_0012_0000$$$::"N-no, I don't want to...!"[lr]::
54606::$$$message_0485_0012_0001$$$::She tries to free her arm, but she doesn't have the strength to even do that.[lr]::
54607::$$$message_0485_0012_0002$$$::The man drags her along, putting on a pleasant front.::
54608::$$$message_0485_0013_0000$$$::"Don't be so upset, Sakura. You should listen to your big brother."[lr]::
54609::$$$message_0485_0013_0001$$$::"No...that's not what you promised! You said you wouldn't hurt Senpai!"[lr]::
54610::$$$message_0485_0013_0002$$$::She protests tearfully.[lr]::
54611::$$$message_0485_0013_0003$$$::It doesn't sway him.[lr]::
54612::$$$message_0485_0013_0004$$$::It seems he's set on playing the caring brother, mouth drawn in a thin smile.::
54613::$$$message_0485_0014_0000$$$::"Uuu..."[lr]::
54614::$$$message_0485_0014_0001$$$::Sobs spill out from her.[lr]::
54615::$$$message_0485_0014_0002$$$::"I care, you know. Grandpa gave me something, but I'd rather not use it."[lr]::
54616::$$$message_0485_0014_0003$$$::The man pulls the girl outside by the arm.::
54617::$$$message_0485_0015_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
54618::$$$message_0485_0015_0001$$$::"Relax. We're just settling things, man to man. I'll keep my promise, and you can come back here once we're finished. It's just, I've gotta rake him over the coals a little bit for leaving my sister in such a sorry state."[lr]::
54619::$$$message_0485_0015_0002$$$::The man whispers in a delighted tone, close enough for his lips to touch the girl's ear.::
54620::$$$message_0485_0016_0000$$$::"...uuu..."[lr]::
54621::$$$message_0485_0016_0001$$$::She closes her mouth.[lr]::
54622::$$$message_0485_0016_0002$$$::She knows better than anyone that her brother won't listen to anyone once he's made up his mind.::
54623::$$$message_0485_0017_0000$$$::"That's a good girl, Sakura. Let's get a step ahead of him. It wouldn't be good to wait here, and if we're going to play, I need to invite him to the base I prepared. Rider, bring Sakura."[lr]::
54624::$$$message_0485_0017_0001$$$::The man passes the girl to a Servant, and leaves the living room.[lr]::
54625::$$$message_0485_0017_0002$$$::"Ri...der..."[lr]::
54626::$$$message_0485_0017_0003$$$::The girl looks up.[lr]::
54627::$$$message_0485_0017_0004$$$::She sees a Servant with flowing hair, long enough to touch the ground.::
54628::$$$message_0485_0018_0000$$$::"I'm home!"[lr]::
54629::$$$message_0485_0018_0001$$$::I announce myself as I enter the house.[lr]::
54630::$$$message_0485_0018_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
54631::$$$message_0485_0018_0003$$$::Suddenly, [lr]::
54632::$$$message_0485_0018_0004$$$::I'm overcome by a sense of discomfort.::
54633::$$$message_0485_0019_0000$$$::"Emiya, the hallway."[lr]::
54634::$$$message_0485_0019_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
54635::$$$message_0485_0019_0002$$$::It's clear what caught her attention.[lr]::
54636::$$$message_0485_0019_0003$$$::In the hallway are marks that look like footprints.[lr]::
54637::$$$message_0485_0019_0004$$$::Only Sakura's shoes are out front.[lr]::
54638::$$$message_0485_0019_0005$$$::I didn't see the caretaker's shoes, so they must have gone home.::
54639::$$$message_0485_0020_0000$$$::"Sakura?"[lr]::
54640::$$$message_0485_0020_0001$$$::I go to the guest bedroom.[lr]::
54641::$$$message_0485_0020_0002$$$::Nobody's inside.[lr]::
54642::$$$message_0485_0020_0003$$$::Discomfort turns to dread.::
54643::$$$message_0485_0021_0000$$$::I go back to the living room.[lr]::
54644::$$$message_0485_0021_0001$$$::Sakura isn't here, either.[lr]::
54645::$$$message_0485_0021_0002$$$::The tracks in the hallway end in the living room.[lr]::
54646::$$$message_0485_0021_0003$$$::Someone with dirty feet did something here and then went outside.::
54647::$$$message_0485_0022_0000$$$::"...Emiya. Look at the floor.[lr]::
54648::$$$message_0485_0022_0001$$$::The tracks end here."[lr]::
54649::$$$message_0485_0022_0002$$$::"I know. Sakura was in here."[lr]::
54650::$$$message_0485_0022_0003$$$::Yes, I know.[lr]::
54651::$$$message_0485_0022_0004$$$::Sakura was here in the living room waiting for me to come home, and now she's gone.::
54652::$$$message_0485_0023_0000$$$::There are unfamiliar footprints in the hallway.[lr]::
54653::$$$message_0485_0023_0001$$$::That's all I know.[lr]::
54654::$$$message_0485_0023_0002$$$::It's strange that I haven't deduced the situation.[lr]::
54655::$$$message_0485_0023_0003$$$::The answer should be clear, once I take some time to think.::
54656::$$$message_0485_0024_0000$$$::Calmly.[lr]::
54657::$$$message_0485_0024_0001$$$::Calmly.[lr]::
54658::$$$message_0485_0024_0002$$$::Calmly.[lr]::
54659::$$$message_0485_0024_0003$$$::If I calm down and think, I'll figure out what happened here.[lr]::
54660::$$$message_0485_0024_0004$$$::But why...[lr]::
54661::$$$message_0485_0024_0005$$$::"..."[lr]::
54662::$$$message_0485_0024_0006$$$::Why won't my brain work at all?::
54663::$$$message_0485_0025_0000$$$::"Hey, Emiya!?"[lr]::
54664::$$$message_0485_0025_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
54665::$$$message_0485_0025_0002$$$::I should have come home earlier.[lr]::
54666::$$$message_0485_0025_0003$$$::I should have taken this more seriously.[lr]::
54667::$$$message_0485_0025_0004$$$::Didn't I take Sakura in because I was afraid this would happen?[lr]::
54668::$$$message_0485_0025_0005$$$::Zouken said that Sakura had nothing to do with this.[lr]::
54669::$$$message_0485_0025_0006$$$::Why did I believe him?[lr]::
54670::$$$message_0485_0025_0007$$$::As long as Sakura's one of the Matous, there's no way she isn't related.::
54671::$$$message_0485_0026_0000$$$::So, why?[lr]::
54672::$$$message_0485_0026_0001$$$::Why did I accept an explanation that was convenient for me, without questioning it at all!?::
54673::$$$message_0485_0027_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
54674::$$$message_0485_0027_0001$$$::The telephone rings.[lr]::
54675::$$$message_0485_0027_0002$$$::Tohsaka keeps quiet. I nod at her, and pick up the receiver.::
54676::$$$message_0485_0028_0000$$$::"Hello? You finally home, Emiya?"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
54677::$$$message_0485_0028_0001$$$::Shinji's the caller.[lr]::
54678::$$$message_0485_0028_0002$$$::There's no doubt about it, and I was expecting this anyway.::
54679::$$$message_0485_0029_0000$$$::"What did you do to Sakura?"[lr]::
54680::$$$message_0485_0029_0001$$$::"Huh? I came to pick her up. She's my sister, so I can't leave her at some other guy's house."::
54681::$$$message_0485_0030_0000$$$::"Shinji."[lr]::
54682::$$$message_0485_0030_0001$$$::"Haha! Nice, you're getting pissed! I bet you're frustrated that I took her back!"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
54683::$$$message_0485_0030_0002$$$::Tohsaka leans in close, as if she can hear what he's saying.[lr]::
54684::$$$message_0485_0030_0003$$$::I keep her at a distance with one hand and continue the call.::
54685::$$$message_0485_0031_0000$$$::"Enough beating around the bush. Tell me what you want."[lr]::
54686::$$$message_0485_0031_0001$$$::"Heh! I bet you know. Let's settle things, Emiya. I bet you think we aren't finished yet, after last time."[r][wsay canskip=1]::
54687::$$$message_0485_0031_0002$$$::"No, we are. You ran away. There's nothing left to settle."::
54688::$$$message_0485_0032_0000$$$::"You still don't get it! That was only because of the difference in our Servants, not you! I never would've run if you didn't have Saber! I never would've lost if Saber hadn't shown up!"::
54689::$$$message_0485_0033_0000$$$::If Saber hadn't shown up?[lr]::
54690::$$$message_0485_0033_0001$$$::...I see now.[lr]::
54691::$$$message_0485_0033_0002$$$::It sounds like Rider hasn't told him that I lost Saber.[lr]::
54692::$$$message_0485_0033_0003$$$::Yeah...that's why he came to take her back by force.[lr]::
54693::$$$message_0485_0033_0004$$$::In other words, this phone call is...::
54694::$$$message_0485_0034_0000$$$::"Shinji. What are you going to do with her?"[lr]::
54695::$$$message_0485_0034_0001$$$::"Don't get all heavy on me, man. I won't do anything to my precious sister.[lr]::
54696::$$$message_0485_0034_0002$$$::Not if you come to see me, alone."[lr]::
54697::$$$message_0485_0034_0003$$$::"Rrgh!"[lr]::
54698::$$$message_0485_0034_0004$$$::I hold off Tohsaka.[lr]::
54699::$$$message_0485_0034_0005$$$::If she interrupts this conversation, it'll definitely go off the rails.::
54700::$$$message_0485_0035_0000$$$::"You're telling me to fight you without Saber?"[lr]::
54701::$$$message_0485_0035_0001$$$::"Nice, I'm glad you understand right away when it counts.[lr]::
54702::$$$message_0485_0035_0002$$$::[line3]Come to the school. Make sure you're alone. Rider's Bounded Field is on the school. If you bring Saber, I'll know right away.[lr]::
54703::$$$message_0485_0035_0003$$$::Of course...I bet you wouldn't do anything so cowardly in front of Sakura."::
54704::$$$message_0485_0036_0000$$$::I hear snickering over the receiver.::
54705::$$$message_0485_0037_0000$$$::"I'll be right there, so wait. One more question: are you a Master, or are you Sakura's big brother?"[lr]::
54706::$$$message_0485_0037_0001$$$::"What kind of joke is that? I'm a Master, and I'm a big brother she can count on. What about you, Emiya? Are you a Master, or a coward?"::
54707::$$$message_0485_0038_0000$$$::"...Fine.[lr]::
54708::$$$message_0485_0038_0001$$$::I'll fight you as a Master, Shinji."[lr]::
54709::$$$message_0485_0038_0002$$$::"Yeah. But only if it comes to a fight."[r][wsay canskip=1]::
54710::$$$message_0485_0038_0003$$$::I hang up the phone.[lr]::
54711::$$$message_0485_0038_0004$$$::Without skipping a beat, I turn on my heel and head straight for the front door.::
54712::$$$message_0485_0039_0000$$$::"Wait![lr]::
54713::$$$message_0485_0039_0001$$$::Are you really going alone!?"[lr]::
54714::$$$message_0485_0039_0002$$$::"That's the plan. We can talk later."::
54715::$$$message_0485_0040_0000$$$::"That's my line.[lr]::
54716::$$$message_0485_0040_0001$$$::Shinji took Sakura with him because he's got something to prove.[lr]::
54717::$$$message_0485_0040_0002$$$::You'll get killed if you go charging in willy-nilly. I don't know if Shinji's aware of it, but if Sakura sees that happen to you, she'll lose it. Right now, we need to consider the situation and make a plan."::
54718::$$$message_0485_0041_0000$$$::I know that.[lr]::
54719::$$$message_0485_0041_0001$$$::But I can't just sit still.[lr]::
54720::$$$message_0485_0041_0002$$$::His laughing still rings in my ears.::
54721::$$$message_0485_0042_0000$$$::"...Oh. So he wants to kill me in front of Sakura."[lr]::
54722::$$$message_0485_0042_0001$$$::"Mm...I can't say for sure, but it's likely... Hey, are you all right? You look calm, but are you actually about to fly off the handle?"::
54723::$$$message_0485_0043_0000$$$::Fly off the handle?[lr]::
54724::$$$message_0485_0043_0001$$$::She's asking me if all I can think of is running to school and punching Shinji in the face.[lr]::
54725::$$$message_0485_0043_0002$$$::In that case...::
