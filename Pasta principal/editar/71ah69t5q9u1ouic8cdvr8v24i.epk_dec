44548::$$$message_0395_0000_0000$$$::Let's go talk to Saber.[lr]::
44549::$$$message_0395_0000_0001$$$::...Even if we defeat Gilgamesh, Saber will still be gone once this fight is over.[lr]::
44550::$$$message_0395_0000_0002$$$::Saber will destroy the Holy Grail with her own hands, and release herself from her duty as a Servant.[lr]::
44551::$$$message_0395_0000_0003$$$::When that moment comes, I won't be able to see her anymore.::
44552::$$$message_0395_0001_0000$$$::...This will be our last conversation.[lr]::
44553::$$$message_0395_0001_0001$$$::Before we head into our last battle, I want to make sure we've left something tangible behind for the two of us.::
44554::$$$message_0395_0002_0000$$$::"Shirou? Did something happen to make you come here?"[lr]::
44555::$$$message_0395_0002_0001$$$::"Well, nothing really happened. I just wanted to see your face. Oh, I'm sorry if I'm interfering with something. Maybe you were trying to concentrate before the big fight."::
44556::$$$message_0395_0003_0000$$$::"What... N-no, nothing of the sort.[lr]::
44557::$$$message_0395_0003_0001$$$::I also wanted to see your face, so I am happy that you are here... Umm, I thought you would've gone to Rin's room for sure."::
44558::$$$message_0395_0004_0000$$$::"Hmmm? Why would I go to Tohsaka's room? It's not like she called me to her room or anything."::
44559::$$$message_0395_0005_0000$$$::"Y-you are right. It seems that my assumption was off, please forget about what I said.[lr]::
44560::$$$message_0395_0005_0001$$$::M-maybe it was unnecessary, but I-I just thought maybe that would be for the best...or something like that."::
44561::$$$message_0395_0006_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
44562::$$$message_0395_0006_0001$$$::Saber is acting even more weird.[lr]::
44563::$$$message_0395_0006_0002$$$::...Not sure why, but I feel like her face will get infinitely redder if I leave her be, so I decide to ask: ::
44564::$$$message_0395_0007_0000$$$::"What's wrong, Saber? You're acting weird right now.[lr]::
44565::$$$message_0395_0007_0001$$$::Did something happen?"::
44566::$$$message_0395_0008_0000$$$::"N-nothing weird happened. I-I was simply trying to rest up and get ready for the fight ahead of us.[lr]::
44567::$$$message_0395_0008_0001$$$::I could ask you the same thing. Are you not planning to sleep for a bit and be in the best possible condition before we head to Ryudou Temple?"::
44568::$$$message_0395_0009_0000$$$::"Mrgh."[lr]::
44569::$$$message_0395_0009_0001$$$::When she puts it like that, it's really hard to say directly to her face that I just wanted to spend time with her.::
44570::$$$message_0395_0010_0000$$$::If I can't say that...[lr]::
44571::$$$message_0395_0010_0001$$$::"Ummm, I can't really sleep. So I was thinking if I'm up already, I might as well come here and get a cup of tea with you.[lr]::
44572::$$$message_0395_0010_0002$$$::I mean Tohsaka seems kind of busy anyway."[lr]::
44573::$$$message_0395_0010_0003$$$::I didn't really think too much and just told her how I felt.::
44574::$$$message_0395_0011_0000$$$::"Tea...you say? When we are about to go face the King of Heroes in just a few hours?"::
44575::$$$message_0395_0012_0000$$$::"Yeah. I figure we're probably both too tense to properly rest.[lr]::
44576::$$$message_0395_0012_0001$$$::Then spend some time with me, Saber. I will treat you to the best tea I have."::
44577::$$$message_0395_0013_0000$$$::"You're right. I would be glad to spend time with you, Shirou."::
44578::$$$message_0395_0014_0000$$$::...Then we must strike the iron while it's hot.[lr]::
44579::$$$message_0395_0014_0001$$$::I head back to the kitchen to brew a pot of the Chinese tea that I bought just for this occasion, thinking I will treat Saber to it.::
44580::$$$message_0395_0015_0000$$$::   Then...[lr]::
44581::$$$message_0395_0015_0001$$$::In the end, we enjoyed the tea together, and nothing else happened.[lr]::
44582::$$$message_0395_0015_0002$$$::We didn't strike up a conversation, not even a short exchange of phrases.[lr]::
44583::$$$message_0395_0015_0003$$$::We simply sat there and stared at the dojo.[lr]::
44584::$$$message_0395_0015_0004$$$::It was a short few days, but we've exchanged quality time here... I think this while staring at the wooden floor.::
44585::$$$message_0395_0016_0000$$$::"Shirou, you should go find Rin. Knowing her, she's probably already come up with something new."[lr]::
44586::$$$message_0395_0016_0001$$$::"Yeah, maybe. I will go if you say so."[lr]::
44587::$$$message_0395_0016_0002$$$::I stand up and leave the dojo.::
44588::$$$message_0395_0017_0000$$$::"Well then, Shirou, see you soon."[lr]::
44589::$$$message_0395_0017_0001$$$::"Yeah. Let me go check up on that angry Master of yours."::
44590::$$$message_0395_0018_0000$$$::I leave the dojo as Saber says goodbye to me.[lr]::
44591::$$$message_0395_0018_0001$$$::...In the end, that was our last time spent together.[lr]::
44592::$$$message_0395_0018_0002$$$::Nothing tangible was left behind between us.[lr]::
44593::$$$message_0395_0018_0003$$$::There were neither promises nor warmth that would sear into my memory. I couldn't create a single sign to remind me that Saber was indeed here.Â ::
44594::$$$message_0395_0019_0000$$$::...But, I have a feeling perhaps that's for the best.[lr]::
44595::$$$message_0395_0019_0001$$$::Whatever's left behind will eventually end up being a fading memory.[lr]::
44596::$$$message_0395_0019_0002$$$::That's why I'll make sure I keep the memories of the simple times we've spent together close to my heart...::
44597::$$$message_0395_0020_0000$$$::"Heeey, Tohsaka. Are you awake?"[lr]::
44598::$$$message_0395_0020_0001$$$::I knock on her door.::
44599::$$$message_0395_0021_0000$$$::"...I am awake. What about you? You don't need to sleep? It looks like you were spending some quality time with Saber at the dojo."::
44600::$$$message_0395_0022_0000$$$::"Oh? I didn't know you were watching us.[lr]::
44601::$$$message_0395_0022_0001$$$::...That makes sense, though. You could see the dojo clearly from your room.[lr]::
44602::$$$message_0395_0022_0002$$$::In that case, you should've come down to the dojo. If you were awake, the three of us could've had some tea together."::
44603::$$$message_0395_0023_0000$$$::"...Whatever.[lr]::
44604::$$$message_0395_0023_0001$$$::...I really didn't think that would work out.[lr]::
44605::$$$message_0395_0023_0002$$$::Anyway, just come in. I was just thinking about going to find you guys to talk about something."[lr]::
44606::$$$message_0395_0023_0003$$$::Hmmm. She seems kinda irritated at something.::
44607::$$$message_0395_0024_0000$$$::"...Got it, thanks."[lr]::
44608::$$$message_0395_0024_0001$$$::Still wondering what she's thinking, I enter the room and slowly close the door behind me.::
44609::$$$message_0395_0025_0000$$$::"Aren't you confident? What were you doing with Saber?"[lr]::
44610::$$$message_0395_0025_0001$$$::Whoa.[lr]::
44611::$$$message_0395_0025_0002$$$::She glares at me as soon as we see each other.::
44612::$$$message_0395_0026_0000$$$::"Nothing really. We were just drinking tea.[lr]::
44613::$$$message_0395_0026_0001$$$::We have a big battle coming up, so we wouldn't be sparring. I can't just waste my energy, after all."::
44614::$$$message_0395_0027_0000$$$::"Waste your energy... O-of course, you really can't afford to waste your energy."[lr]::
44615::$$$message_0395_0027_0001$$$::...Huh?[lr]::
44616::$$$message_0395_0027_0002$$$::Why did you get quiet all of a sudden?::
44617::$$$message_0395_0028_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, are you in a really bad mood right now?"[lr]::
44618::$$$message_0395_0028_0001$$$::I already know what she's going to say, but it doesn't hurt to ask.[lr]::
44619::$$$message_0395_0028_0002$$$::"WHAT DO YOU THINK?"[lr]::
44620::$$$message_0395_0028_0003$$$::She'd obviously yell at me, but I really am curious, so I end up asking her anyway.[lr]::
44621::$$$message_0395_0028_0004$$$::However...::
44622::$$$message_0395_0029_0000$$$::"...Never mind. It's not like I'm actually mad at you."[lr]::
44623::$$$message_0395_0029_0001$$$::Well, now she's making me even more confused.::
44624::$$$message_0395_0030_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, do you...have a fever or something?"[lr]::
44625::$$$message_0395_0030_0001$$$::"No, I don't! ...Ugh, will you just sit down already!?[lr]::
44626::$$$message_0395_0030_0002$$$::I will think of something to deal with Gilgamesh since you can't think of anything by yourself!"::
44627::$$$message_0395_0031_0000$$$::Tohsaka drags me inside the room and locks the door. Then she slowly moves back into the room.[lr]::
44628::$$$message_0395_0031_0001$$$::"...?"[lr]::
44629::$$$message_0395_0031_0002$$$::Anyway, I start to move toward the center of the room.[lr]::
44630::$$$message_0395_0031_0003$$$::Facing toward Tohsaka, I sit down across from her.::
44631::$$$message_0395_0032_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
44632::$$$message_0395_0032_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
44633::$$$message_0395_0032_0002$$$::And somehow we're both not saying a word, this feels awkward...::
44634::$$$message_0395_0033_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, about Gilgamesh..."[lr]::
44635::$$$message_0395_0033_0001$$$::"...I know. You're going to tell me you don't want to have Saber fight him, right? You're really considerate of her."::
44636::$$$message_0395_0034_0000$$$::"Hold on, that's not what I'm talking about.[lr]::
44637::$$$message_0395_0034_0001$$$::I'm simply saying that Gilgamesh is a bad match for Saber, so we should rethink our formation, that's all. If Saber is defeated and no one is left to slow him down, Tohsaka would be next."::
44638::$$$message_0395_0035_0000$$$::"...I see. Well how do you propose we change our formation?[lr]::
44639::$$$message_0395_0035_0001$$$::I'm not going up against that Goldy. He is taking advantage of his treasury and has anti-magecraft armor on. He's a bad match for Saber but an even worse match for me. Same for you."::
44640::$$$message_0395_0036_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
44641::$$$message_0395_0036_0001$$$::She's right.::
44642::$$$message_0395_0037_0000$$$::...But I just can't forget those eyes.[lr]::
44643::$$$message_0395_0037_0001$$$::What Archer's gaze was trying to tell me.[lr]::
44644::$$$message_0395_0037_0002$$$::That golden Servant.[lr]::
44645::$$$message_0395_0037_0003$$$::Only Shirou Emiya can go up against Gilgamesh.::¿O
