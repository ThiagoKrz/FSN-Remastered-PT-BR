65786::$$$message_0608_0000_0000$$$::Morning.[lr]::
65787::$$$message_0608_0000_0001$$$::Slowly, my mind[lr]::
65788::$$$message_0608_0000_0002$$$::...::
65789::$$$message_0608_0001_0000$$$::"Mm..."[lr]::
65790::$$$message_0608_0001_0001$$$::Morning.[lr]::
65791::$$$message_0608_0001_0002$$$::Slowly, my mind wakes up, and I sluggishly sit up.::
65792::$$$message_0608_0002_0000$$$::The clock reads after 8 o'clock.[lr]::
65793::$$$message_0608_0002_0001$$$::I'm late.[lr]::
65794::$$$message_0608_0002_0002$$$::Okay, I'm not exactly "late" since I'm not going to school, but I definitely overslept.::
65795::$$$message_0608_0003_0000$$$::"Oh no, I need to make breakfast."[lr]::
65796::$$$message_0608_0003_0001$$$::I get up and change.[lr]::
65797::$$$message_0608_0003_0002$$$::While changing from my pajamas to my regular clothes, I'm forced to look at my left arm whether I like it or not.::
65798::$$$message_0608_0004_0000$$$::"...Hup."[lr]::
65799::$$$message_0608_0004_0001$$$::I try lifting my left arm during my morning stretches.[lr]::
65800::$$$message_0608_0004_0002$$$::No problem here.[lr]::
65801::$$$message_0608_0004_0003$$$::I can lift it up to shoulder level, exactly as I intend.[lr]::
65802::$$$message_0608_0004_0004$$$::It's improving day by day.[lr]::
65803::$$$message_0608_0004_0005$$$::I still can't feel anything through it, but at this rate, by tomorrow it should[line2]::
65804::$$$message_0608_0005_0000$$$::"What are you doing, Shirou? Breakfast is already over."[lr]::
65805::$$$message_0608_0005_0001$$$::"Huh? Wuh? Wait, what?"::
65806::$$$message_0608_0006_0000$$$::Illya's in front of me.[lr]::
65807::$$$message_0608_0006_0001$$$::I meant to go to the living room, but I somehow ended up in the shed.::
65808::$$$message_0608_0007_0000$$$::"Did you hear me, Shirou? I asked you what you're doing here."[lr]::
65809::$$$message_0608_0007_0001$$$::"Y...yeah, I heard you. Morning, Illya. Funny running into you here."::
65810::$$$message_0608_0008_0000$$$::...Hm.[lr]::
65811::$$$message_0608_0008_0001$$$::My answer sounds absurd even to me.[lr]::
65812::$$$message_0608_0008_0002$$$::I must not be fully awake yet.::
65813::$$$message_0608_0009_0000$$$::"Shirou. Are you not feeling well?"[lr]::
65814::$$$message_0608_0009_0001$$$::"Eh? No, I'm fine. I'm just still a little sleepy. Hold on."[lr]::
65815::$$$message_0608_0009_0002$$$::I shake my head.[lr]::
65816::$$$message_0608_0009_0003$$$::I'm still physically exhausted, but the drowsiness is gone.::
65817::$$$message_0608_0010_0000$$$::"...There. To answer your question, I'm not here for any particular reason. I just took a wrong turn while I was half-asleep."[lr]::
65818::$$$message_0608_0010_0001$$$::"Okay. Well, come to the living room. I'll make you breakfast."[lr]::
65819::$$$message_0608_0010_0002$$$::Illya cheerfully runs back into the yard.::
65820::$$$message_0608_0011_0000$$$::It's a clear day.[lr]::
65821::$$$message_0608_0011_0001$$$::The sky is a bright blue, washing away yesterday's gloom.[lr]::
65822::$$$message_0608_0011_0002$$$::I take a deep breath, filling my lungs with comfortably cool air.::
65823::$$$message_0608_0012_0000$$$::"...Hm? Did Illya say she's making breakfast?"[lr]::
65824::$$$message_0608_0012_0001$$$::She did.[lr]::
65825::$$$message_0608_0012_0002$$$::The first thought that comes to my now-operational mind is her last remark.::
65826::$$$message_0608_0013_0000$$$::Illya's breakfast... I'm looking forward to it, but the notion makes me very uneasy.[lr]::
65827::$$$message_0608_0013_0001$$$::I can say with confidence that Illya has never been in a kitchen before, much less picked up a chef's knife.::
65828::$$$message_0608_0014_0000$$$::"Ahh... I should probably go supervise her."[lr]::
65829::$$$message_0608_0014_0001$$$::I head towards the living room, feeling the prickly grass beneath my feet.[lr]::
65830::$$$message_0608_0014_0002$$$::I'm shocked again.[lr]::
65831::$$$message_0608_0014_0003$$$::Talk about sleepwalking![lr]::
65832::$$$message_0608_0014_0004$$$::What was I thinking, coming out here barefoot?::
65833::$$$message_0608_0015_0000$$$::I arrive in the living room almost four minutes later,[lr]::
65834::$$$message_0608_0015_0001$$$::after taking the time to clean the dirt off my feet.[lr]::
65835::$$$message_0608_0015_0002$$$::"Oh, Senpai."[lr]::
65836::$$$message_0608_0015_0003$$$::I nearly bump into Sakura when I enter the living room.::
65837::$$$message_0608_0016_0000$$$::"Morning, Sakura... Sorry about this morning. I overslept until after eight."[lr]::
65838::$$$message_0608_0016_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65839::$$$message_0608_0016_0002$$$::...?[lr]::
65840::$$$message_0608_0016_0003$$$::Sakura stares at me. I wonder if she didn't hear me.::
65841::$$$message_0608_0017_0000$$$::"Sakura?"[lr]::
65842::$$$message_0608_0017_0001$$$::I reach out to her, thinking her fever might have come back.[lr]::
65843::$$$message_0608_0017_0002$$$::But...[lr]::
65844::$$$message_0608_0017_0003$$$::"G-good morning, Senpai!"[lr]::
65845::$$$message_0608_0017_0004$$$::She greets me at full volume, making my concern unwarranted.::
65846::$$$message_0608_0018_0000$$$::"Hey, you're in good spirits this morning. Does that mean your body's feeling better?"[lr]::
65847::$$$message_0608_0018_0001$$$::"Y-yes, thanks to you, I'm full of energy. B-because you gave me some of yours."::
65848::$$$message_0608_0019_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
65849::$$$message_0608_0019_0001$$$::Sakura speaks haltingly.[lr]::
65850::$$$message_0608_0019_0002$$$::...Hmm. I'm glad she's upbeat, but the fact she doesn't look calm makes me worried, too.::
65851::$$$message_0608_0020_0000$$$::"What's wrong? Sakura? You're being kinda weird. What do you mean, I gave you some of my energy?"[lr]::
65852::$$$message_0608_0020_0001$$$::"Ah, uh... I mean, er, last night..."[lr]::
65853::$$$message_0608_0020_0002$$$::"In your bedroom," she trails off.[lr]::
65854::$$$message_0608_0020_0003$$$::Sakura mumbles bashfully.::
65855::$$$message_0608_0021_0000$$$::"...Oh."[lr]::
65856::$$$message_0608_0021_0001$$$::Now I remember.[lr]::
65857::$$$message_0608_0021_0002$$$::How could I forget?[lr]::
65858::$$$message_0608_0021_0003$$$::Last night, [lr]::
65859::$$$message_0608_0021_0004$$$::I held Sakura.::
65860::$$$message_0608_0022_0000$$$::Or rather, she embraced me.::
65861::$$$message_0608_0023_0000$$$::"Agh... Oof."[lr]::
65862::$$$message_0608_0023_0001$$$::Heat suddenly rises to my head.[lr]::
65863::$$$message_0608_0023_0002$$$::It instantly reaches boiling point, as if all of my blood below my neck was pumped there.::
65864::$$$message_0608_0024_0000$$$::"S-Sakura, last night, that..."[lr]::
65865::$$$message_0608_0024_0001$$$::Really happened, right? It wasn't a dream?[lr]::
65866::$$$message_0608_0024_0002$$$::Blushing and with an expression that seems to blame me somehow, she nods.::
65867::$$$message_0608_0025_0000$$$::"~~~~~~~~~"[lr]::
65868::$$$message_0608_0025_0001$$$::Wow.[lr]::
65869::$$$message_0608_0025_0002$$$::Just when I thought my face couldn't get any hotter, it does.[lr]::
65870::$$$message_0608_0025_0003$$$::Meaning that last night...::
65871::$$$message_0608_0026_0000$$$::Shirou Emiya's rational mind labeled everything that happened[lr]::
65872::$$$message_0608_0026_0001$$$::as a dream, and filed it away[line2]wait, not that!::
65873::$$$message_0608_0027_0000$$$::"Sakura, um. S-sorry about that."[lr]::
65874::$$$message_0608_0027_0001$$$::I clumsily apologize to her, holding my dizzy head in my hand.[lr]::
65875::$$$message_0608_0027_0002$$$::"...Yes, but I was happy, Senpai."[lr]::
65876::$$$message_0608_0027_0003$$$::Her shy smile is like a mortal blow to the heart.::
65877::$$$message_0608_0028_0000$$$::"Ah...urgh."[lr]::
65878::$$$message_0608_0028_0001$$$::...She got me.[lr]::
65879::$$$message_0608_0028_0002$$$::She's so lovely. I want to hug her again right now.::
65880::$$$message_0608_0029_0000$$$::If Illya wasn't around and I didn't hear the TV on in the living room, I'd…[lr]::
65881::$$$message_0608_0029_0001$$$::"Shirou! Breakfast is ready!"[lr]::
65882::$$$message_0608_0029_0002$$$::If Illya hadn't chimed in right on cue, I might have charged straight into super-mushy mode again.::
65883::$$$message_0608_0030_0000$$$::"A-anyway, I'm here to eat breakfast. Let's talk later!"[lr]::
65884::$$$message_0608_0030_0001$$$::I make a sharp turn like a robot and head for the living room.[lr]::
65885::$$$message_0608_0030_0002$$$::I desperately move my sluggish arms and legs, taking control of my mind and driving the desire into a corner of it.::
