63697::$$$message_0586_0000_0000$$$::It's past one in the morning by the time I'm back in my bedroom.::
63698::$$$message_0586_0001_0000$$$::"Haah..."[lr]::
63699::$$$message_0586_0001_0001$$$::I plop down on my futon.[lr]::
63700::$$$message_0586_0001_0002$$$::Tonight's patrol was fruitless.[lr]::
63701::$$$message_0586_0001_0003$$$::All we learned was that the story on the morning news was true.::
63702::$$$message_0586_0002_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
63703::$$$message_0586_0002_0001$$$::The enemy I have to defeat.[lr]::
63704::$$$message_0586_0002_0002$$$::To be honest, when I think about that thing I'll have to fight eventually, it gives me chills and makes me want to vomit.::
63705::$$$message_0586_0003_0000$$$::Zouken and Assassin are opponents that a human can still fight.[lr]::
63706::$$$message_0586_0003_0001$$$::But the other two aren't.[lr]::
63707::$$$message_0586_0003_0002$$$::I'm not even sure if the Shadow can die. As for Saber, I don't have a chance in hell of beating her.[lr]::
63708::$$$message_0586_0003_0003$$$::But now that innocent people are dying, it doesn't matter whether I can win or not.::
63709::$$$message_0586_0004_0000$$$::"Archer's arm, huh..."[lr]::
63710::$$$message_0586_0004_0001$$$::I touch the red cloth around my left arm.[lr]::
63711::$$$message_0586_0004_0002$$$::...I do have a weapon.[lr]::
63712::$$$message_0586_0004_0003$$$::I don't know how well it'll work, but it's still a weapon.[lr]::
63713::$$$message_0586_0004_0004$$$::The question is whether I can master it, and whether I'll be able to survive using it.::
63714::$$$message_0586_0005_0000$$$::"...Just a little should be okay, right?"[lr]::
63715::$$$message_0586_0005_0001$$$::I unwrap the red cloth.[lr]::
63716::$$$message_0586_0005_0002$$$::My blood starts to flow as soon as I loosen the binding.::
63717::$$$message_0586_0006_0000$$$::                                     Suddenly...[lr]::
63718::$$$message_0586_0006_0001$$$::                                     I feel like I hear a beast howling.::
63719::$$$message_0586_0007_0000$$$::Something stabs me.[lr]::
63720::$$$message_0586_0007_0001$$$::It's stabbing me throughout my body.[lr]::
63721::$$$message_0586_0007_0002$$$::Is this pain? If it is, then no pain I've felt before counts as pain anymore.::
63722::$$$message_0586_0008_0000$$$::It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.[lr]::
63723::$$$message_0586_0008_0001$$$::The uneven tatami. My bed's softness hurts me. I feel like I'm sitting on a hill of swords. The air is toxic, and I die three times from breathing it. A bird chirps in the distance. The wind is strong. There's no humidity. My skin dries out and turns to sand. It flows and sloughs away. I crumble away.::
63724::$$$message_0586_0009_0000$$$::Hot stakes stab me through the exposed holes.[lr]::
63725::$$$message_0586_0009_0001$$$::Thirty-two of them, through my shoulder.[lr]::
63726::$$$message_0586_0009_0002$$$::Each of them delicately, meticulously, excellently, precisely skewers my internal jugular vein, trachea, spinal cord, sympathetic nerves, bilateral upper, middle, and lower lobes, aorta, heart, diaphragm, spleen, stomach, liver, and all eight sections of my large intestine.::
63727::$$$message_0586_0010_0000$$$::"Argh...ngh..."[lr]::
63728::$$$message_0586_0010_0001$$$::I'm crumbling.[lr]::
63729::$$$message_0586_0010_0002$$$::Time slows at a frightening pace.[lr]::
63730::$$$message_0586_0010_0003$$$::I watch sixty trillion cells crumble at a rate of three hundred forty per second.::
63731::$$$message_0586_0011_0000$$$::"[line5], [line7]"[lr]::
63732::$$$message_0586_0011_0001$$$::There is no pain.[lr]::
63733::$$$message_0586_0011_0002$$$::There is no pain.[lr]::
63734::$$$message_0586_0011_0003$$$::There is no pain.[lr]::
63735::$$$message_0586_0011_0004$$$::There is only terror.[lr]::
63736::$$$message_0586_0011_0005$$$::The credits roll, invading with astonishing speed,[lr]::
63737::$$$message_0586_0011_0006$$$::the flashback stops on a maniacal image,[lr]::
63738::$$$message_0586_0011_0007$$$::the death to come, the death in the past, the death happening now, the pain isn't physical pain but a burst of rejection each time death strikes me[line4][lr]::
63739::$$$message_0586_0011_0008$$$::"Hah, ahh...!"[lr]::
63740::$$$message_0586_0011_0009$$$::...I hear a noise.[lr]::
63741::$$$message_0586_0011_0010$$$::I'm on my knees. It's the sound of my head hitting the floor.::
63742::$$$message_0586_0012_0000$$$::"Ah...argh..."[lr]::
63743::$$$message_0586_0012_0001$$$::...My eyes are hot.[lr]::
63744::$$$message_0586_0012_0002$$$::I realize I've been crying.::
63745::$$$message_0586_0013_0000$$$::"Ah...aahh, ah."[lr]::
63746::$$$message_0586_0013_0001$$$::I desperately stop a scream from escaping my throat.[lr]::
63747::$$$message_0586_0013_0002$$$::I curl up into a ball, tuck my head into my stomach, and clutch my left arm in my right hand, weeping.::
63748::$$$message_0586_0014_0000$$$::"...Ah...aahh, ahh..."[lr]::
63749::$$$message_0586_0014_0001$$$::I'm scared.[lr]::
63750::$$$message_0586_0014_0002$$$::I haven't felt this since the fire ten years ago.[lr]::
63751::$$$message_0586_0014_0003$$$::I'm scared.[lr]::
63752::$$$message_0586_0014_0004$$$::It's the dread that every living creature feels.[lr]::
63753::$$$message_0586_0014_0005$$$::I'm scared.[lr]::
63754::$$$message_0586_0014_0006$$$::For the first time in my life, I want to escape my own doom.::
63755::$$$message_0586_0015_0000$$$::"Hah...ah."[lr]::
63756::$$$message_0586_0015_0001$$$::I don't reject death because it hurts.[lr]::
63757::$$$message_0586_0015_0002$$$::Nor because I want to live.[lr]::
63758::$$$message_0586_0015_0003$$$::It just...scares me.::
63759::$$$message_0586_0016_0000$$$::"...ah...kh."[lr]::
63760::$$$message_0586_0016_0001$$$::I tie the red cloth back on.[lr]::
63761::$$$message_0586_0016_0002$$$::I knot it over and over so that it'll never come loose again.::
63762::$$$message_0586_0017_0000$$$::"I can't. I just can't."[lr]::
63763::$$$message_0586_0017_0001$$$::I was sobbing.[lr]::
63764::$$$message_0586_0017_0002$$$::The priest said I'd die if I used my left arm.[lr]::
63765::$$$message_0586_0017_0003$$$::That's bullshit.[lr]::
63766::$$$message_0586_0017_0004$$$::I'll die if I even take off this shroud.[lr]::
63767::$$$message_0586_0017_0005$$$::My body might be able to take it, but my mind will go first.::
63768::$$$message_0586_0018_0000$$$::Even slightly loosening it and exposing the skin to the air was enough of mental ordeal.[lr]::
63769::$$$message_0586_0018_0001$$$::If I couldn't even endure that, then I can't possibly live without the shroud.::
63770::$$$message_0586_0019_0000$$$::    No.[lr]::
63771::$$$message_0586_0019_0001$$$::If this arm is a contradictory thing that no one should touch, then it's too late ::
63772::$$$message_0586_0019_0002$$$::my body is already a train on an abandoned and condemned railroad track, running to its final stop[r]::
63773::$$$message_0586_0019_0003$$$::a ship with a crack in its hull sinking into the ocean depths with no one to save it[r]::
63774::$$$message_0586_0019_0004$$$::only the passengers are unaware, and by the time they notice, it's already too late...::
63775::$$$message_0586_0020_0000$$$::"...Ngah."::
63776::$$$message_0586_0021_0000$$$::                              My breathing is ragged.::
63777::$$$message_0586_0022_0000$$$::"Argh..."::
63778::$$$message_0586_0023_0000$$$::                              I was having a bad dream.::
63779::$$$message_0586_0024_0000$$$::...I wipe sweat from my forehead.[lr]::
63780::$$$message_0586_0024_0001$$$::I can't even stand up.[lr]::
63781::$$$message_0586_0024_0002$$$::I just stay curled up, bearing this pain I don't understand in my head I don't understand.::
63782::$$$message_0586_0025_0000$$$::"Urgh...ngh..."[lr]::
63783::$$$message_0586_0025_0001$$$::...I can't remember.[lr]::
63784::$$$message_0586_0025_0002$$$::My left arm hurts.[lr]::
63785::$$$message_0586_0025_0003$$$::It hurts so bad, I wish I didn't have a left arm.[lr]::
63786::$$$message_0586_0025_0004$$$::I try to remember why it hurts so much, but I can't remember how I was feeling just a second ago.::
63787::$$$message_0586_0026_0000$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
63788::$$$message_0586_0026_0001$$$::The pain recedes.[lr]::
63789::$$$message_0586_0026_0002$$$::I manage to bundle up my disjointed mind.[lr]::
63790::$$$message_0586_0026_0003$$$::It must have been because I was sleeping.[lr]::
63791::$$$message_0586_0026_0004$$$::My scattered memories feel like chopped onions that should cook nicely if I organize them.[lr]::
63792::$$$message_0586_0026_0005$$$::Sizzle. Sizzle, sizzle.[lr]::
63793::$$$message_0586_0026_0006$$$::See? Add a drizzle of soy sauce for color, some pepper for flavor, and a pinch of potato starch to bring the mess all together.::
63794::$$$message_0586_0027_0000$$$::"Wow... that sounds gross."[lr]::
63795::$$$message_0586_0027_0001$$$::I mumble absently.[lr]::
63796::$$$message_0586_0027_0002$$$::My useless head, that only knows how to help other people so much it's a nuisance, comes up with one conclusion.[lr]::
63797::$$$message_0586_0027_0003$$$::I don't have to eat something that doesn't look tasty.::
63798::$$$message_0586_0028_0000$$$::I lost it already.[lr]::
63799::$$$message_0586_0028_0001$$$::It doesn't make sense to rely on something that isn't there.[lr]::
63800::$$$message_0586_0028_0002$$$::Therefore, Shirou Emiya has no weapon.[lr]::
63801::$$$message_0586_0028_0003$$$::He has to suppress this alien thing as long as he lives,[lr]::
63802::$$$message_0586_0028_0004$$$::and it'll taint him for the rest of his life.::
63803::$$$message_0586_0029_0000$$$::"Ngah...!"[lr]::
63804::$$$message_0586_0029_0001$$$::It's futile to restrain it with this cloth.[lr]::
63805::$$$message_0586_0029_0002$$$::There's only one way to truly escape this poison.[lr]::
63806::$$$message_0586_0029_0003$$$::"[line3], [line5]"[lr]::
63807::$$$message_0586_0029_0004$$$::I know that, but I can't bear to let it go.::
63808::$$$message_0586_0030_0000$$$::The muzzle of a gun points at my temple.[lr]::
63809::$$$message_0586_0030_0001$$$::I imagine its trigger.[lr]::
63810::$$$message_0586_0030_0002$$$::The left arm is the trigger.[lr]::
63811::$$$message_0586_0030_0003$$$::Once I pull it, it'll operate as designed and blow my brains out.::
63812::$$$message_0586_0031_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
63813::$$$message_0586_0031_0001$$$::I'm trembling.[lr]::
63814::$$$message_0586_0031_0002$$$::In the dim light, I hold my breath and stare at the blank wall.::
63815::$$$message_0586_0032_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
63816::$$$message_0586_0032_0001$$$::I hold my left arm tight again and fall back down.[lr]::
63817::$$$message_0586_0032_0002$$$::...I close my eyes.[lr]::
63818::$$$message_0586_0032_0003$$$::I stifle my pathetic moans. It's time to sleep, so I can be rested tomorrow.::
