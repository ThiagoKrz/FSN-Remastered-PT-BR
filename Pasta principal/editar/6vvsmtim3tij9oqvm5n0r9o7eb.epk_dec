44498::$$$message_0394_0000_0000$$$::"That's right, there's no way I can sleep like this."[lr]::
44499::$$$message_0394_0000_0001$$$::A strategy against Gilgamesh.[lr]::
44500::$$$message_0394_0000_0002$$$::If we are to face a cold-hearted enemy like that, we will end up with nothing but regret if we don't try to find an opportunity.::
44501::$$$message_0394_0001_0000$$$::If we go to Ryudou Temple now, I'm sure someone is going to die.[lr]::
44502::$$$message_0394_0001_0001$$$::Rather than end up with a regret like that, it's not a shame to try to do anything, to struggle until the very last moment.::
44503::$$$message_0394_0002_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, are you still awake?"[lr]::
44504::$$$message_0394_0002_0001$$$::I knock on her door.::
44505::$$$message_0394_0003_0000$$$::"...! W-wait a minute, don't you dare come in right now!"[lr]::
44506::$$$message_0394_0003_0001$$$::...Hm.[lr]::
44507::$$$message_0394_0003_0002$$$::Knowing Tohsaka, I thought she would be sleeping by now, but it seems she's still awake.::
44508::$$$message_0394_0004_0000$$$::Not only that, she's panicking.[lr]::
44509::$$$message_0394_0004_0001$$$::I can hear her running around the room for something.[lr]::
44510::$$$message_0394_0004_0002$$$::It seems she's finally calming down.[lr]::
44511::$$$message_0394_0004_0003$$$::After a loud, deep breath that I can hear through the wall, she opens the door.::
44512::$$$message_0394_0005_0000$$$::"And, what do you want?"[lr]::
44513::$$$message_0394_0005_0001$$$::She glares at me as soon as we see each other.::
44514::$$$message_0394_0006_0000$$$::"Well, it's to continue our conversation from earlier. I want to think more about how we can counter Gilgamesh."[lr]::
44515::$$$message_0394_0006_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
44516::$$$message_0394_0006_0002$$$::...Huh.[lr]::
44517::$$$message_0394_0006_0003$$$::Why are you staring me down like that?::
44518::$$$message_0394_0007_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, are you in a really bad mood right now?"[lr]::
44519::$$$message_0394_0007_0001$$$::I already know what she's going to say, but it doesn't hurt to ask.[lr]::
44520::$$$message_0394_0007_0002$$$::"WHAT DO YOU THINK?"[lr]::
44521::$$$message_0394_0007_0003$$$::She'd obviously yell at me, but I really am curious, so I end up asking her anyway.[lr]::
44522::$$$message_0394_0007_0004$$$::However...::
44523::$$$message_0394_0008_0000$$$::"...Never mind. It's not like I'm actually mad at you."[lr]::
44524::$$$message_0394_0008_0001$$$::Well, now she's making me even more confused.::
44525::$$$message_0394_0009_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, do you...have a fever or something?"[lr]::
44526::$$$message_0394_0009_0001$$$::"No, I don't! Ugh, look, will you just come in? If you want to talk about Gilgamesh, then I actually wanted to go to your room and discuss something with you."::
44527::$$$message_0394_0010_0000$$$::Tohsaka drags me inside the room and locks the door. Then she slowly moves back into the room.::
44528::$$$message_0394_0011_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
44529::$$$message_0394_0011_0001$$$::Anyway, I start to move toward the center of the room.[lr]::
44530::$$$message_0394_0011_0002$$$::Facing toward Tohsaka, I sit down across from her.::
44531::$$$message_0394_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
44532::$$$message_0394_0012_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
44533::$$$message_0394_0012_0002$$$::Silence.[lr]::
44534::$$$message_0394_0012_0003$$$::She said she had something she wanted to talk to me about, yet she's not saying a word right now.::
44535::$$$message_0394_0013_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, about Gilgamesh..."[lr]::
44536::$$$message_0394_0013_0001$$$::"...I know. You're going to tell me you don't want to have Saber fight him, right? You're really considerate of her."::
44537::$$$message_0394_0014_0000$$$::"Hold on, that's not what I'm talking about.[lr]::
44538::$$$message_0394_0014_0001$$$::I'm simply saying that Gilgamesh is a bad match for Saber, so we should rethink our formation, that's all. If Saber is defeated and no one is left to slow him down, Tohsaka would be next."::
44539::$$$message_0394_0015_0000$$$::"...Hmph. You said you want to change our current formation, but what exactly? I'm not going up against that Goldy.[lr]::
44540::$$$message_0394_0015_0001$$$::He is taking advantage of his treasury and has anti-magecraft armor on.[lr]::
44541::$$$message_0394_0015_0002$$$::He's a bad match for Saber, but an even worse match for me. Same for you."::
44542::$$$message_0394_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
44543::$$$message_0394_0016_0001$$$::She's right.::
44544::$$$message_0394_0017_0000$$$::...But I just can't forget those eyes.[lr]::
44545::$$$message_0394_0017_0001$$$::What Archer's gaze was trying to tell me.[lr]::
44546::$$$message_0394_0017_0002$$$::That golden Servant.[lr]::
44547::$$$message_0394_0017_0003$$$::Only Shirou Emiya can go up against Gilgamesh.2ØO
