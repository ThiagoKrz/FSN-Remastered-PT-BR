12846::$$$message_0129_0000_0001$$$::The golden sword begins to reveal itself in Saber's hand.[lr]::
12847::$$$message_0129_0000_0002$$$::   I told her not to use it.[lr]::
12848::$$$message_0129_0000_0003$$$::The sword I told her never to use, no matter what.::

12850::$$$message_0129_0001_0001$$$::I snap.[lr]::
12851::$$$message_0129_0001_0002$$$::The last thread that had been holding me together finally gives.[lr]::
12852::$$$message_0129_0001_0003$$$::"DON'T USE IT, SABER!!!"[lr]::
12853::$$$message_0129_0001_0004$$$::My left hand burns.[lr]::
12854::$$$message_0129_0001_0005$$$::A Command Spell stroke disappears.::
12855::$$$message_0129_0002_0000$$$::"Wha... Why? We have no other choice, Shirou!"::
12856::$$$message_0129_0003_0000$$$::I don't care.[lr]::
12857::$$$message_0129_0003_0001$$$::To hell with that.[lr]::
12858::$$$message_0129_0003_0002$$$::All I know is that if she uses it, she'll disappear.::
12859::$$$message_0129_0004_0000$$$::"Kngh..."::
12860::$$$message_0129_0005_0000$$$::You're already on your last legs just from unleashing your sword.[lr]::
12861::$$$message_0129_0005_0001$$$::You can't use it right now.[lr]::
12862::$$$message_0129_0005_0002$$$::So just hold on.[lr]::
12863::$$$message_0129_0005_0003$$$::If you can't use your sword, I'll make one you can use!::
12864::$$$message_0129_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"Then at least imagine it. If you can't possibly beat the opponent in reality, then beat them in your imagination.[font italic=false][lr]::

12866::$$$message_0129_0007_0000$$$::It's so obvious.[lr]::
12867::$$$message_0129_0007_0001$$$::It's the only thing I can do.[lr]::
12868::$$$message_0129_0007_0002$$$::I have to make it.[lr]::
12869::$$$message_0129_0007_0003$$$::I have to make something that won't lose. I have to imagine the strongest weapon. I have to imagine the ultimate imitation... It has to fool everyone, even me.::
12870::$$$message_0129_0008_0000$$$::                                          It shouldn't be that hard.[lr]::
12871::$$$message_0129_0008_0001$$$::                                      It's not something impossible.[lr]::
12872::$$$message_0129_0008_0002$$$::                                     Since the beginning, my body...[lr]::
12873::$$$message_0129_0008_0003$$$::              ...has been a specialized Magic Circuit for this purpose alone![lr]::
12874::$$$message_0129_0008_0004$$$::"...Hup."[lr]::
12875::$$$message_0129_0008_0005$$$::I leap up.[lr]::
12876::$$$message_0129_0008_0006$$$::My entire body burns like it's on fire. My left hand is crimson.::
12877::$$$message_0129_0009_0000$$$::"Wha... That sword is...mine!?"[lr]::
12878::$$$message_0129_0009_0001$$$::Saber's voice rings with shocked disbelief.[lr]::
12879::$$$message_0129_0009_0002$$$::She's staring at the weapon in my hands...at the thing that shouldn't exist.::
12880::$$$message_0129_0010_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
12881::$$$message_0129_0010_0001$$$::The sword seems to have a will of its own.[lr]::
12882::$$$message_0129_0010_0002$$$::"Oooooooohhh!!!"[lr]::
12883::$$$message_0129_0010_0003$$$::The golden blade moves as if it's being drawn to the giant's arm. It slashes at him, tearing through the arm.::
12884::$$$message_0129_0011_0000$$$::Tohsaka falls to the ground along with the arm that had been holding her. The golden sword shatters as if it had been made of glass.::
12885::$$$message_0129_0012_0000$$$::My blood begins to flow backward.[lr]::
12886::$$$message_0129_0012_0001$$$::It doesn't matter.[lr]::
12887::$$$message_0129_0012_0002$$$::The sword broke.[lr]::
12888::$$$message_0129_0012_0003$$$::That's impossible. If I imitated [font italic=true]that[font italic=false] sword, it shouldn't have shattered like that.[lr]::
12889::$$$message_0129_0012_0004$$$::It shattered because it wasn't sufficient.[lr]::
12890::$$$message_0129_0012_0005$$$::My image of the sword wasn't enough.::
12891::$$$message_0129_0013_0000$$$::[wacky len=12][lr]::
12892::$$$message_0129_0013_0001$$$::Berserker's furious gaze turns toward me.[lr]::
12893::$$$message_0129_0013_0002$$$::His massive sword swings up at me. This time, he's determined to cut me in half.::
12894::$$$message_0129_0014_0000$$$::   It doesn't matter.[lr]::
12895::$$$message_0129_0014_0001$$$::Berserker, you're not my enemy right now.[lr]::
12896::$$$message_0129_0014_0002$$$::I'm only fighting against one person right now.[lr]::
12897::$$$message_0129_0014_0003$$$::The last one wasn't perfect.[lr]::
12898::$$$message_0129_0014_0004$$$::My image of it was flawed, so the sword that should have been invincible broke.[lr]::
12899::$$$message_0129_0014_0005$$$::If I'm to duplicate things, I need to work on not just their shape, but also their maker.::

12901::$$$message_0129_0015_0001$$$::I hear the others holding their breath.[lr]::
12902::$$$message_0129_0015_0002$$$::In front of me, I see the axe-sword rushing toward me like an oncoming storm, and a half-formed sword ready to block it.[lr]::
12903::$$$message_0129_0015_0003$$$::In desperation, I try to use the sword to block the incoming blade.[lr]::
12904::$$$message_0129_0015_0004$$$::   But that doesn't matter to me.[lr]::
12905::$$$message_0129_0015_0005$$$::Right now, I need to finish this blade to make it real.::

12909::$$$message_0129_0017_0000$$$::You don't have to remind me.[lr]::
12910::$$$message_0129_0017_0001$$$::What I need to do is simple.[lr]::
12911::$$$message_0129_0017_0002$$$::"Projection, start."::
12912::$$$message_0129_0018_0000$$$::I concentrate[lr]::

12915::$$$message_0129_0019_0001$$$::Determining creation ideology...[lr]::

12923::$$$message_0129_0019_0009$$$::                          Illusion shall bind with reality to forge a sword!::
12924::$$$message_0129_0020_0000$$$::[wacky len=12]![lr]::
12925::$$$message_0129_0020_0001$$$::The giant roars.[lr]::
12926::$$$message_0129_0020_0002$$$::My sword deflects the countless gusts assailing me from the enemy's furious attacks!::
12927::$$$message_0129_0021_0000$$$::"...Ngh!"[lr]::
12928::$$$message_0129_0021_0001$$$::But that's about it.[lr]::
12929::$$$message_0129_0021_0002$$$::I'm knocked away from him.[lr]::
12930::$$$message_0129_0021_0003$$$::The moment I come to, the sword leaves everything to me.[lr]::
12931::$$$message_0129_0021_0004$$$::The attacks I blocked so easily a moment ago now toss me around effortlessly.::
12932::$$$message_0129_0022_0000$$$::"Hah...ah!"[lr]::
12933::$$$message_0129_0022_0001$$$::I can't feel my arms. The skin of my wrists is blistered and red. I'm surprised I can even keep my grip on the sword.::
12934::$$$message_0129_0023_0000$$$::"...Kngh!"[lr]::
12935::$$$message_0129_0023_0001$$$::My legs do not work. I can only imagine every muscle shredded to ribbons.[lr]::
12936::$$$message_0129_0023_0002$$$::   I can't get up.[lr]::
12937::$$$message_0129_0023_0003$$$::I made...a sword that surpasses Berserker.[lr]::
12938::$$$message_0129_0023_0004$$$::But that's all.[lr]::
12939::$$$message_0129_0023_0005$$$::I'm just the one who made it... I can't wield the sword I worked so hard to make!::
12940::$$$message_0129_0024_0000$$$::A shadow looms over me.[lr]::
12941::$$$message_0129_0024_0001$$$::He must know who he has to kill first now.[lr]::
12942::$$$message_0129_0024_0002$$$::I rush away and Berserker rushes after me like a gust of wind.::
12943::$$$message_0129_0024_0003$$$::His enormous sword swings toward me...::
12944::$$$message_0129_0025_0000$$$::...but is deflected.[lr]::
12945::$$$message_0129_0025_0001$$$::"Eh?"[lr]::
12946::$$$message_0129_0025_0002$$$::In complete disbelief, I realize another hand has closed around my own.::
12947::$$$message_0129_0026_0000$$$::[wacky len=12]!!![lr]::
12948::$$$message_0129_0026_0001$$$::The air splits around me.[lr]::
12949::$$$message_0129_0026_0002$$$::The giant attacks with all his might, trying to destroy everything around him.[lr]::
12950::$$$message_0129_0026_0003$$$::But right before that happens...[lr]::
12951::$$$message_0129_0026_0004$$$::"Shirou...your hand!"[lr]::
12952::$$$message_0129_0026_0005$$$::She's so close, I can hear her voice over the din.::
12953::$$$message_0129_0027_0000$$$::If Berserker is a stormfront coming to attack me,[lr]::
12954::$$$message_0129_0027_0001$$$::Saber is a gale rushing to my side.[lr]::
12955::$$$message_0129_0027_0002$$$::Saber sprints over to me and twists around, gripping me firmly.::
12956::$$$message_0129_0028_0000$$$::The rock sword shatters.[lr]::
12957::$$$message_0129_0028_0001$$$::The golden flash explodes through the giant's axe-sword and continues ahead, slicing through Berserker's rocklike body without slowing.::
12958::$$$message_0129_0029_0000$$$::Maybe I copied the form so well that I copied some of its abilities too...[lr]::
12959::$$$message_0129_0029_0001$$$::The golden sword lodges deep in Berserker's body, and glows so brilliantly that light pours from the giant's body.::
12960::$$$message_0129_0030_0000$$$::    And then in an instant...[lr]::
12961::$$$message_0129_0030_0001$$$::The light fades and the forest falls silent.[lr]::
12962::$$$message_0129_0030_0002$$$::"Ha...ah...!"[lr]::
12963::$$$message_0129_0030_0003$$$::All the strength flees my limbs.[lr]::
12964::$$$message_0129_0030_0004$$$::The heat that had been surging through me rapidly cools.[lr]::
12965::$$$message_0129_0030_0005$$$::The sword I made begins to disappear.::
12966::$$$message_0129_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
12967::$$$message_0129_0031_0001$$$::I watch it vacantly.[lr]::
12968::$$$message_0129_0031_0002$$$::Saber and I remain together, holding the sword in our hands until it's disappeared completely.::
12969::$$$message_0129_0032_0000$$$::Wind sweeps through the clearing.::
12970::$$$message_0129_0032_0001$$$::The earth-shaking howl and the blade that had churned up the very air are gone.[lr]::
12971::$$$message_0129_0032_0002$$$::"So is that your blade, Saber?"[lr]::
12972::$$$message_0129_0032_0003$$$::The previously invincible giant, now immobile, looks to the knight who defeated him and speaks in a low, rumbling voice.::
12973::$$$message_0129_0032_0004$$$::"This is Caliburn...the sword in the stone meant to select the king. It is my blade, and it was lost forever.[lr]::
12974::$$$message_0129_0032_0005$$$::However..."[lr]::
12975::$$$message_0129_0032_0006$$$::"It is not your sword anymore. It was merely an illusion that boy created."[lr]::
12976::$$$message_0129_0032_0007$$$::Saber nods quietly.::
12977::$$$message_0129_0032_0008$$$::"An imitation...a blade that will never again exist...[lr]::
12978::$$$message_0129_0032_0009$$$::And yet..."[lr]::
12979::$$$message_0129_0032_0010$$$::Berserker's chest opens up.[lr]::
12980::$$$message_0129_0032_0011$$$::He begins to dissolve.[lr]::
12981::$$$message_0129_0032_0012$$$::His body begins to crumble like wet sand, beginning where the sword pierced him and rapidly expanding outward.::
12982::$$$message_0129_0032_0013$$$::"But that illusion should not be underestimated. I never expected it could have destroyed me seven times over in a single blow."[lr]::
12983::$$$message_0129_0032_0014$$$::His dying words are spoken without emotion.[lr]::
12984::$$$message_0129_0032_0015$$$::The mad warrior keeps to his role until his very end, and fades away in a dispersing haze into the misty morning air.::
12985::$$$message_0129_0033_0000$$$::Dizziness rocks me where I stand.[lr]::
12986::$$$message_0129_0033_0001$$$::This is probably the price for such excessive use of magecraft. The blood that rages through me is putting pressure on my brain, sending far too much oxygen out to the rest of my body.[lr]::
12987::$$$message_0129_0033_0002$$$::...My head feels like it could split open.[lr]::
12988::$$$message_0129_0033_0003$$$::The enemy has disappeared and whatever was numbing the pain earlier has faded.[lr]::
12989::$$$message_0129_0033_0004$$$::As if to make me pay the accumulated toll of this incredible battle, the dizziness and headache crash into me like twin meteors.::
12990::$$$message_0129_0034_0000$$$::"...Ngh!"[lr]::
12991::$$$message_0129_0034_0001$$$::"Shirou!?"[lr]::
12992::$$$message_0129_0034_0002$$$::I'm about to collapse, but Saber supports me.[lr]::
12993::$$$message_0129_0034_0003$$$::Saber shouldn't have the energy for that either at this point.::
12994::$$$message_0129_0035_0000$$$::"No. I'm fine. I've got a few broken bones, but nothing fatal. I've got that healing thing, and it's already kicking in, so I'll be fine."[lr]::
12995::$$$message_0129_0035_0001$$$::"That is nonsense. You used Projection magecraft to the extreme. You must rest right now."[lr]::
12996::$$$message_0129_0035_0002$$$::"Uh...but..."[lr]::
12997::$$$message_0129_0035_0003$$$::There's someone I have to talk to first.::
12998::$$$message_0129_0036_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
12999::$$$message_0129_0036_0001$$$::"Illyasviel!"[lr]::
13000::$$$message_0129_0036_0002$$$::Saber stands ready.[lr]::
13001::$$$message_0129_0036_0003$$$::Illya stares at where Berserker had been standing, her eyes hollow.::
13002::$$$message_0129_0037_0000$$$::"Good. I do not know if there is a reason for her to remain here, but she has spared us the need to pursue her. She shall die grace[line2]"::
13003::$$$message_0129_0038_0000$$$::"No, Saber! Don't hurt Illya. Without Berserker, she's..."[lr]::
13004::$$$message_0129_0038_0001$$$::I stop Saber with the last remaining strength I have.::
13005::$$$message_0129_0039_0000$$$::Illya doesn't even seem to notice we're here.[lr]::
13006::$$$message_0129_0039_0001$$$::She just stares at the ground.[lr]::
13007::$$$message_0129_0039_0002$$$::"No way. Did you die...Berserker?"[lr]::
13008::$$$message_0129_0039_0003$$$::She sounds like an abandoned child.::
13009::$$$message_0129_0040_0000$$$::"...Illya."[lr]::
13010::$$$message_0129_0040_0001$$$::Illya lifts her head absentmindedly.[lr]::
13011::$$$message_0129_0040_0002$$$::"...Nnng...ahhhh!!!"[lr]::
13012::$$$message_0129_0040_0003$$$::It happens suddenly.[lr]::
13013::$$$message_0129_0040_0004$$$::Illya collapses like a puppet with its strings cut.::
13014::$$$message_0129_0041_0000$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
13015::$$$message_0129_0041_0001$$$::I don't know what happened; I just stare at Illya where she lies.[lr]::
13016::$$$message_0129_0041_0002$$$::"...Gh...ha...twa...!"[lr]::
13017::$$$message_0129_0041_0003$$$::And at almost the same moment, Tohsaka raises her hand.[lr]::
13018::$$$message_0129_0041_0004$$$::She's freed, now that Berserker's arm's disappeared.::
13019::$$$message_0129_0042_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
13020::$$$message_0129_0042_0001$$$::I must have loosened up the moment I learned Tohsaka was safe.[lr]::
13021::$$$message_0129_0042_0002$$$::My vision blurs and I can feel my body trying to pass out.::
13022::$$$message_0129_0043_0000$$$::I can't show that kind of weakness.[lr]::
13023::$$$message_0129_0043_0001$$$::We may have defeated Berserker, but we're still in the forest.[lr]::
13024::$$$message_0129_0043_0002$$$::Weary as we are, we have to force ourselves to get out of the forest.::
13025::$$$message_0129_0044_0000$$$::...I look up at the sky as it begins to lighten.[lr]::
13026::$$$message_0129_0044_0001$$$::The town is a long way away, all my allies are wounded, and every single inch of me hurts.[lr]::
13027::$$$message_0129_0044_0002$$$::And yet, morning has come.[lr]::
13028::$$$message_0129_0044_0003$$$::We survived a night I was prepared not to.[lr]::
13029::$$$message_0129_0044_0004$$$::After defeating our greatest enemy, we leave the winter forest.:ç°˘
