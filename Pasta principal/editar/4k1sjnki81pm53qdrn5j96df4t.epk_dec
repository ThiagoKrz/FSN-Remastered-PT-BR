75281::$$$message_0693_0000_0000$$$::It'd be dangerous for me to leave this spot without first figuring out what's going on.::
75282::$$$message_0693_0001_0000$$$::"I'm staying. Are you set on going...?"[lr]::
75283::$$$message_0693_0001_0001$$$::"Yeah. But you're making the right choice. I have Archer, but you're alone.[lr]::
75284::$$$message_0693_0001_0002$$$::It isn't wrong to be cautious."::
75285::$$$message_0693_0002_0000$$$::"...All right. Don't get careless just because Archer's here."[lr]::
75286::$$$message_0693_0002_0001$$$::"Of course not. I'll be right back if it looks dangerous."::
75287::$$$message_0693_0003_0000$$$::Tohsaka runs into the woods without looking back.[lr]::
75288::$$$message_0693_0003_0001$$$::...The air continues rumbling.[lr]::
75289::$$$message_0693_0003_0002$$$::Tohsaka said that Berserker is fighting.[lr]::
75290::$$$message_0693_0003_0003$$$::He must be up against Zouken and Assassin.[lr]::
75291::$$$message_0693_0003_0004$$$::Berserker won't lose in pure fighting strength.[lr]::
75292::$$$message_0693_0003_0005$$$::There's no tactic that Assassin or Zouken could use to overcome him.[lr]::
75293::$$$message_0693_0003_0006$$$::But...wasn't that true for Saber, too?::
75294::$$$message_0693_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75295::$$$message_0693_0004_0001$$$::...I have an ominous hunch that I might be making the same mistake as before...::
75296::$$$message_0693_0005_0000$$$::"...!?"[lr]::
75297::$$$message_0693_0005_0001$$$::Darkness falls.[lr]::
75298::$$$message_0693_0005_0002$$$::It isn't the darkness that comes from an absence of light.[lr]::
75299::$$$message_0693_0005_0003$$$::Instead, a dark light is seared into my retinas, like I've just looked directly into the sun.::
75300::$$$message_0693_0006_0000$$$::"Eh?"[lr]::
75301::$$$message_0693_0006_0001$$$::My worsening sense of dread is accompanied by a new worry.[lr]::
75302::$$$message_0693_0006_0002$$$::   I'm in complete darkness. I can't tell up from down or left from right.[lr]::
75303::$$$message_0693_0006_0003$$$::It's like an awful, sudden hallucination that I've been swallowed into a world of nothingness.::
75304::$$$message_0693_0007_0000$$$::"No...it can't be...!"[lr]::
75305::$$$message_0693_0007_0001$$$::Without my vision, I feel my way through the lightless forest.[lr]::
75306::$$$message_0693_0007_0002$$$::Thud. Thump.[lr]::
75307::$$$message_0693_0007_0003$$$::I bump into tree trunks.::
75308::$$$message_0693_0008_0000$$$::"Hah... hah, hah, hah, ah...!"[lr]::
75309::$$$message_0693_0008_0001$$$::I push my way forward clumsily.[lr]::
75310::$$$message_0693_0008_0002$$$::Blood trickles from my shoulders.[lr]::
75311::$$$message_0693_0008_0003$$$::My forehead slams into a hard tree trunk. The pain is intense.[lr]::
75312::$$$message_0693_0008_0004$$$::   Still, I want the feedback.[lr]::
75313::$$$message_0693_0008_0005$$$::Getting injured from bumping into things is more comforting than nothing at all.::
75314::$$$message_0693_0009_0000$$$::"Hah... hah, hah, hah."[lr]::
75315::$$$message_0693_0009_0001$$$::It'll be okay.[lr]::
75316::$$$message_0693_0009_0002$$$::I'll be all right. It's just temporary blindness from seeing a sudden bright light.[lr]::
75317::$$$message_0693_0009_0003$$$::The forest is still there, and I can feel the ground beneath my feet.[lr]::
75318::$$$message_0693_0009_0004$$$::Everything's just gone dark in my eyes.[lr]::
75319::$$$message_0693_0009_0005$$$::I'll recover with time.::
75320::$$$message_0693_0010_0000$$$::...It should take just a little longer before my eyes work again.[lr]::
75321::$$$message_0693_0010_0001$$$::I don't know what that light was, and I'm worried about Tohsaka, but I'd just be a burden to her if I rushed in.[lr]::
75322::$$$message_0693_0010_0002$$$::I need to concentrate on recovering my eyesight and escaping this darkness.::
75323::$$$message_0693_0011_0000$$$::...[r]::
75324::$$$message_0693_0011_0001$$$::......[r]::
75325::$$$message_0693_0011_0002$$$::.........[r]::
75326::$$$message_0693_0011_0003$$$::............[r]::
75327::$$$message_0693_0011_0004$$$::...............Just a little more.[lr]::
75328::$$$message_0693_0011_0005$$$::I'm sure my eyesight will return soon.[lr]::
75329::$$$message_0693_0011_0006$$$::There's nothing to worry about.[lr]::
75330::$$$message_0693_0011_0007$$$::My eyesight will return. I can say that for sure.::
75331::$$$message_0693_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75332::$$$message_0693_0012_0001$$$::But I am worried about the noises around me.[lr]::
75333::$$$message_0693_0012_0002$$$::The gusts of wind stopped at some point.[lr]::
75334::$$$message_0693_0012_0003$$$::The thumping noises are gone, too.[lr]::
75335::$$$message_0693_0012_0004$$$::I wonder what it means that I've stopped bumping into all those trees.::
75336::$$$message_0693_0013_0000$$$::"Almost there. Just a little more."[lr]::
75337::$$$message_0693_0013_0001$$$::Just a little longer until my eyesight is back.[lr]::
75338::$$$message_0693_0013_0002$$$::I need to wait in this dark void until then.[lr]::
75339::$$$message_0693_0013_0003$$$::I'll focus on that for now.[lr]::
75340::$$$message_0693_0013_0004$$$::I can ponder later why I'm not touching the forest anymore.[lr]::
75341::$$$message_0693_0013_0005$$$::I can wonder later why it's dark even though my eyes are working again and my vision is back to normal.::
75342::$$$message_0693_0014_0000$$$::"...Right. Just gotta get out of this darkness as soon as I can."[lr]::
75343::$$$message_0693_0014_0001$$$::Still feeling nothing, I walk through the darkness.[lr]::
75344::$$$message_0693_0014_0002$$$::...I know I'm in the middle of a forest, but it's so dark that my imagination goes to bad places.::
75345::$$$message_0693_0015_0000$$$::For example...[lr]::
75346::$$$message_0693_0015_0001$$$::Maybe I got trapped in a world of shadows with no exit.[lr]::
75347::$$$message_0693_0015_0002$$$::A bad joke like that, maybe.::
75348::$$$message_0693_0016_0000$$$::"Ha...haha, ha..."::
75349::$$$message_0693_0017_0000$$$::I chuckle bitterly at how lame it sounds, and keep going.[lr]::
75350::$$$message_0693_0017_0001$$$::I can't feel anything.[lr]::
75351::$$$message_0693_0017_0002$$$::But it's just a little longer.[lr]::
75352::$$$message_0693_0017_0003$$$::A little longer.[lr]::
75353::$$$message_0693_0017_0004$$$::A little longer.[lr]::
75354::$$$message_0693_0017_0005$$$::A little longer.[lr]::
75355::$$$message_0693_0017_0006$$$::Just a little longer until my eyesight returns,[lr]::
75356::$$$message_0693_0017_0007$$$::and I see the place I was just in earlier...:˜ò
