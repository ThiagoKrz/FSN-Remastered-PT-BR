42109::$$$message_0367_0000_0000$$$::    And we walk towards her.[lr]::
42110::$$$message_0367_0000_0001$$$::The center of the hall.[lr]::
42111::$$$message_0367_0000_0002$$$::With gray sunlight coming in from the ceiling, the girl is sleeping, covered in rubble.::
42112::$$$message_0367_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42113::$$$message_0367_0001_0001$$$::Her eyes don't open.[lr]::
42114::$$$message_0367_0001_0002$$$::Looking up close, the girl is not white at all.[lr]::
42115::$$$message_0367_0001_0003$$$::The girl covered in red all over looks nothing like before.::
42116::$$$message_0367_0002_0000$$$::"...It's not your fault, Emiya.[lr]::
42117::$$$message_0367_0002_0001$$$::You know that, right? We couldn't have saved her."::
42118::$$$message_0367_0003_0000$$$::I know.[lr]::
42119::$$$message_0367_0003_0001$$$::I've been taught that there are people I can save and people I cannot save.[lr]::
42120::$$$message_0367_0003_0002$$$::I knew that I would be putting my own life in danger if I tried to do things that are beyond my capacity.::
42121::$$$message_0367_0004_0000$$$::    But still...[lr]::
42122::$$$message_0367_0004_0001$$$::I still wanted to save her.[lr]::
42123::$$$message_0367_0004_0002$$$::I don't want a child to die.[lr]::
42124::$$$message_0367_0004_0003$$$::I don't want anyone dying in front of me.[lr]::
42125::$$$message_0367_0004_0004$$$::Asking for help...[lr]::
42126::$$$message_0367_0004_0005$$$::Not being able to save someone asking for help is more scary and painful than anything.::
42127::$$$message_0367_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42128::$$$message_0367_0005_0001$$$::There's no way I can apologize, and I don't know her well enough to apologize either.[lr]::
42129::$$$message_0367_0005_0002$$$::This girl has nothing to do with me.[lr]::
42130::$$$message_0367_0005_0003$$$::I understand that without having to be told, but why...::
42131::$$$message_0367_0006_0000$$$::"...Oh."[lr]::
42132::$$$message_0367_0006_0001$$$::Why are these eyes crying irrelevant tears?::
42133::$$$message_0367_0007_0000$$$::"...Why?"[lr]::
42134::$$$message_0367_0007_0001$$$::"...Tohsaka?"::
42135::$$$message_0367_0008_0000$$$::"...Why?[lr]::
42136::$$$message_0367_0008_0001$$$::You knew you were going to be killed if you went at him.[lr]::
42137::$$$message_0367_0008_0002$$$::So why did you try to save Illyasviel?[lr]::
42138::$$$message_0367_0008_0003$$$::No matter what the results may be, Illyasviel was an enemy.[lr]::
42139::$$$message_0367_0008_0004$$$::So how can you go so far for her sake?"::
42140::$$$message_0367_0009_0000$$$::Did she seriously just ask me that?[lr]::
42141::$$$message_0367_0009_0001$$$::Tohsaka's eyes were serious.[lr]::
42142::$$$message_0367_0009_0002$$$::"...I have no reason. I stopped him because I just wanted to save her."[lr]::
42143::$$$message_0367_0009_0003$$$::There's no other way to explain it.[lr]::
42144::$$$message_0367_0009_0004$$$::After Tohsaka glares at me...::
42145::$$$message_0367_0010_0000$$$::"...I see. I thought you were abnormal before, but now I'm sure.[lr]::
42146::$$$message_0367_0010_0001$$$::Shirou. The way that you live is really distorted."[lr]::
42147::$$$message_0367_0010_0002$$$::She tries to open the lid that I've kept closed this whole time.::
42148::$$$message_0367_0011_0000$$$::"Distorted...?"[lr]::
42149::$$$message_0367_0011_0001$$$::"That's right. It's wrong to live thinking that others are more important than yourself.[lr]::
42150::$$$message_0367_0011_0002$$$::Look, I'm not talking about the common opinion that people save others so that they can be loved. [lr]::
42151::$$$message_0367_0011_0003$$$::Setting that hypocrisy aside, human beings have to put themselves first."::
42152::$$$message_0367_0012_0000$$$::"Of course there are people with others as their priority.[lr]::
42153::$$$message_0367_0012_0001$$$::But, first of all, you're something special that can't be put on a scale.[r]::
42154::$$$message_0367_0012_0002$$$::You're like the scale itself. But you're trying to break that scale and help others that you don't even know."::
42155::$$$message_0367_0013_0000$$$::"...Yes, that's fine. If you're a human that doesn't have a sense of self and is merely living, then that's fine.[lr]::
42156::$$$message_0367_0013_0001$$$::But, you do have a sense of self.[lr]::
42157::$$$message_0367_0013_0002$$$::You can't neglect yourself when you have a strong sense of self-awareness.[lr]::
42158::$$$message_0367_0013_0003$$$::   If you keep on doing that, you're going to eventually break down."::
42159::$$$message_0367_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42160::$$$message_0367_0014_0001$$$::[font italic=true]No way.[font italic=false][lr]::
42161::$$$message_0367_0014_0002$$$::I can't break down.[lr]::
42162::$$$message_0367_0014_0003$$$::In fact, I do this in order not to.[lr]::
42163::$$$message_0367_0014_0004$$$::I try to save people that I could not save so that I can hold my head high...::
42164::$$$message_0367_0015_0000$$$::"No. You are broken already.[lr]::
42165::$$$message_0367_0015_0001$$$::...So tell me. I don't know what happened ten years ago. But, that must be the cause of why you're screwed up...!"::
42166::$$$message_0367_0016_0000$$$::Tohsaka seems like she's got tears in her eyes.[lr]::
42167::$$$message_0367_0016_0001$$$::Why is she making such a face?[lr]::
42168::$$$message_0367_0016_0002$$$::It's almost as if...[lr]::
42169::$$$message_0367_0016_0003$$$::She knows that I'm going to spend my life trying to help others without getting anything in return, so she's trying to earnestly stop me.::
42170::$$$message_0367_0017_0000$$$::"...It was like that at school too. You were super calm in front of that many bodies... Even I mistook them for dead bodies, but you were able to tell that they were all alive with just one glance."::
42171::$$$message_0367_0018_0000$$$::"I always thought that was strange.[lr]::
42172::$$$message_0367_0018_0001$$$::You never even had formal training as a mage, but you were able to calm yourself down every time you got into a fight to the death.[lr]::
42173::$$$message_0367_0018_0002$$$::Even if you got enraged by seeing corpses, you never had any aversion towards corpses themselves.[lr]::
42174::$$$message_0367_0018_0003$$$::That must be... Because you were used to seeing people's deaths. You saw something that gruesome ten years ago, right?"::
42175::$$$message_0367_0019_0000$$$::Used to seeing...?[lr]::
42176::$$$message_0367_0019_0001$$$::Yeah, it's not like that was my first time seeing them.[lr]::
42177::$$$message_0367_0019_0002$$$::I think about the students who were on the floor at school, Rider, who was unrecognizable by the time she died, and the girl sleeping in front of us now... To me, the people who died in that incident from ten years ago are the only ones that went through "inhuman deaths."::
42178::$$$message_0367_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42179::$$$message_0367_0020_0001$$$::But, that's wrong.[lr]::
42180::$$$message_0367_0020_0002$$$::The fire ten years ago saved me.[lr]::
42181::$$$message_0367_0020_0003$$$::That cannot be the cause for why Tohsaka is criticizing me right now.::
42182::$$$message_0367_0021_0000$$$::"No, Tohsaka. That's not it. I was saved, that's all."::
42183::$$$message_0367_0022_0000$$$::"Saved...? So you were saved from that fire ten years ago? And that was by Kiritsugu Emiya?"::
42184::$$$message_0367_0023_0000$$$::"Yeah, that's right. But that's it. That isn't the cause for anything."[lr]::
42185::$$$message_0367_0023_0001$$$::My heart aches when I answer.[lr]::
42186::$$$message_0367_0023_0002$$$::My body is telling me that's a lie.::
42187::$$$message_0367_0024_0000$$$::"Then was there something else? Something you're always regretting or something Kiritsugu Emiya took away from you in compensation for saving you?"::
42188::$$$message_0367_0025_0000$$$::"...There's no such thing. Kiritsugu just saved me. And there was nothing to be taken from me..."[lr]::
42189::$$$message_0367_0025_0001$$$::I shouldn't have had anything then.::
42190::$$$message_0367_0026_0000$$$::   I saw many corpses.[lr]::
42191::$$$message_0367_0026_0001$$$::   I died at that time and was reborn.::
42192::$$$message_0367_0027_0000$$$::     I don't have repentances about the path I took.[lr]::
42193::$$$message_0367_0027_0001$$$::My eyes lost their hatred,[lr]::
42194::$$$message_0367_0027_0002$$$::my hands lost their anger,[lr]::
42195::$$$message_0367_0027_0003$$$::my feet lost their hope,[lr]::
42196::$$$message_0367_0027_0004$$$::and I lost myself there.[lr]::
42197::$$$message_0367_0027_0005$$$::...So why?[lr]::
42198::$$$message_0367_0027_0006$$$::How did I gain the strong sense of self-awareness that Tohsaka speaks of?::
42199::$$$message_0367_0028_0000$$$::"...That is..."[lr]::
42200::$$$message_0367_0028_0001$$$::I had accepted death.[lr]::
42201::$$$message_0367_0028_0002$$$::I knew that I was going to die.[lr]::
42202::$$$message_0367_0028_0003$$$::Even though my body was saved from such a situation, there's no way my mind could have been saved as well.::
42203::$$$message_0367_0029_0000$$$::At that time, I...[lr]::
42204::$$$message_0367_0029_0001$$$::I just admired something precious, still empty inside.::
42205::$$$message_0367_0030_0000$$$::"Oh... That's... Right."[lr]::
42206::$$$message_0367_0030_0001$$$::I remember now.[lr]::
42207::$$$message_0367_0030_0002$$$::No, I didn't even put it in my memory.[lr]::
42208::$$$message_0367_0030_0003$$$::That's why I didn't even realize until now that that's what really saved me.::
42209::$$$message_0367_0031_0000$$$::"...Shirou? So did he make you sign some contract or something?"[lr]::
42210::$$$message_0367_0031_0001$$$::"No. He didn't take anything away from me. I only received."::
42211::$$$message_0367_0032_0000$$$::A world like hell.[lr]::
42212::$$$message_0367_0032_0001$$$::In a place where every person except for me died, I was saved.[lr]::
42213::$$$message_0367_0032_0002$$$::Nobody saved me, and I wasn't able to save anyone.[lr]::
42214::$$$message_0367_0032_0003$$$::In my final moment, he granted something that I thought was a miracle.::
42215::$$$message_0367_0033_0000$$$::"...I remember. His eyes that peered into my eyes, and his voice pleading for me to live.[lr]::
42216::$$$message_0367_0033_0001$$$::On the verge of death, I thought not about how I was saved, but the fact that someone was there to save me was..."::
42217::$$$message_0367_0034_0000$$$::Such a wonderful miracle.[lr]::
42218::$$$message_0367_0034_0001$$$::That's why I admired it.[lr]::
42219::$$$message_0367_0034_0002$$$::I had nothing left, not a single thing. That's why I ended up admiring the figure that appeared right before my eyes.::
42220::$$$message_0367_0035_0000$$$::"That's why I..."::
42221::$$$message_0367_0036_0000$$$::   Only had... That.[lr]::
42222::$$$message_0367_0036_0001$$$::That's the only emotion I had while being saved.[lr]::
42223::$$$message_0367_0036_0002$$$::I was happy.[lr]::
42224::$$$message_0367_0036_0003$$$::I cried.[lr]::
42225::$$$message_0367_0036_0004$$$::That's all I could think about.[lr]::
42226::$$$message_0367_0036_0005$$$::So... That's the only emotion I could create...::
42227::$$$message_0367_0037_0000$$$::"...Yeah. You're probably right."[lr]::
42228::$$$message_0367_0037_0001$$$::It's twisted to prioritize others over myself.[lr]::
42229::$$$message_0367_0037_0002$$$::There is something seriously wrong with the procedure.::
42230::$$$message_0367_0038_0000$$$::"But, I'm the only one who was saved. I thought about it at that time.[lr]::
42231::$$$message_0367_0038_0001$$$::   That if such a thing happened again, I need to save everyone in place of all those that I couldn't save then."::
42232::$$$message_0367_0039_0000$$$::"Ugh, I'm telling you that's crazy...![lr]::
42233::$$$message_0367_0039_0001$$$::Look, if you were saved, take care of yourself! I'm sorry for those who died, but it's just a coincidence that only you were saved![lr]::
42234::$$$message_0367_0039_0002$$$::Then appreciate your luck. You suffered that much, so it would be a waste if you didn't have fun!"::
42235::$$$message_0367_0040_0000$$$::Tohsaka is seriously angry.[lr]::
42236::$$$message_0367_0040_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42237::$$$message_0367_0040_0002$$$::Yeah, that makes me really happy.[lr]::
42238::$$$message_0367_0040_0003$$$::I finally realize now, since Tohsaka is that kind of person.::
42239::$$$message_0367_0041_0000$$$::The question I've been wondering about all by myself.[lr]::
42240::$$$message_0367_0041_0001$$$::I wanted to become a hero of justice, so I always tried to help others.[lr]::
42241::$$$message_0367_0041_0002$$$::I noticed there was something wrong with that method, but I couldn't understand what.::
42242::$$$message_0367_0042_0000$$$::   But that became clear so easily.[lr]::
42243::$$$message_0367_0042_0001$$$::Thanks to the person who gets seriously angry for my sake.::
42244::$$$message_0367_0043_0000$$$::"W-What? Do you still not get it even after saying this much?[lr]::
42245::$$$message_0367_0043_0001$$$::You really make me mad. If you're really that dumb, I'm going to break off our[line2]"[lr]::
42246::$$$message_0367_0043_0002$$$::"No, I get it. I said that you're right."::
42247::$$$message_0367_0044_0000$$$::"Then[line2]"[lr]::
42248::$$$message_0367_0044_0001$$$::"But, I can't listen to your warning.[lr]::
42249::$$$message_0367_0044_0002$$$::There is something wrong with me. But it's fine.[lr]::
42250::$$$message_0367_0044_0003$$$::Because there's no way that wanting to be of help for someone can be a mistake."::
42251::$$$message_0367_0045_0000$$$::So...[lr]::
42252::$$$message_0367_0045_0001$$$::I answer her with as much gratitude as I can.::
42253::$$$message_0367_0046_0000$$$::"Guh...[lr]::
42254::$$$message_0367_0046_0001$$$::...Geez. I can't say anything if you make a face like that."[lr]::
42255::$$$message_0367_0046_0002$$$::Tohsaka must've felt awkward, as she turns her back to me and walks away.::
42256::$$$message_0367_0047_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
42257::$$$message_0367_0047_0001$$$::"...Well, it can't be helped. I guess I'll do something about it for you."[lr]::
42258::$$$message_0367_0047_0002$$$::She takes a deep sigh and complains.UÖr”
