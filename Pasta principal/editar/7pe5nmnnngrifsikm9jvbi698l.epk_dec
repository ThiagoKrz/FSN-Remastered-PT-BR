64683::$$$message_0595_0000_0000$$$::This happened ten years ago.[lr]::
64684::$$$message_0595_0000_0001$$$::In the middle of a blazing town, I chased the responsibility of being the only survivor.::
64685::$$$message_0595_0001_0000$$$::                                                     "Will you          ?"::
64686::$$$message_0595_0002_0000$$$::I've never forgotten, not even once.[lr]::
64687::$$$message_0595_0002_0001$$$::The price I paid for surviving is to make sure that this scene never happens again.::
64688::$$$message_0595_0003_0000$$$::                                                 "Will you betray it all?"::
64689::$$$message_0595_0004_0000$$$::I swore an oath.[lr]::
64690::$$$message_0595_0004_0001$$$::I swore to myself that I'd always do the right thing, like my old man.[lr]::
64691::$$$message_0595_0004_0002$$$::That's what Shirou Emiya has spent his life doing.[lr]::
64692::$$$message_0595_0004_0003$$$::I got this far allowing my own life to be used by others, so that I could proudly face those who couldn't be saved.::
64693::$$$message_0595_0005_0000$$$::I understand that all too well.[lr]::
64694::$$$message_0595_0005_0001$$$::I do.[lr]::
64695::$$$message_0595_0005_0002$$$::And yet...::
64696::$$$message_0595_0006_0000$$$::                                            "Will you betray your old self?"::
64697::$$$message_0595_0007_0000$$$::I know the main culprit.[lr]::
64698::$$$message_0595_0007_0001$$$::You know who you should defeat.[lr]::
64699::$$$message_0595_0007_0002$$$::The black sun.[lr]::
64700::$$$message_0595_0007_0003$$$::You have to kill that Shadow which appeared in the sky that day, before it happens again.::
64701::$$$message_0595_0008_0000$$$::"...Ahh."[lr]::
64702::$$$message_0595_0008_0001$$$::Remember what you've lived for, all this time.[lr]::
64703::$$$message_0595_0008_0002$$$::You affirmed your way of life to save those who wish to be saved, and to help innocent people who get caught in tragedies.[lr]::
64704::$$$message_0595_0008_0003$$$::And if you're going to reject it all now for just one woman...::
64705::$$$message_0595_0009_0000$$$::"If you're going to betray it all..."::
64706::$$$message_0595_0010_0000$$$::                            Then Shirou Emiya must pass judgment on himself.::
64707::$$$message_0595_0011_0000$$$::"...It's morning."[lr]::
64708::$$$message_0595_0011_0001$$$::I wake up from my slumber.[lr]::
64709::$$$message_0595_0011_0002$$$::It's bright outside, and past seven o'clock.::
64710::$$$message_0595_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64711::$$$message_0595_0012_0001$$$::My body feels heavy.[lr]::
64712::$$$message_0595_0012_0002$$$::My limbs feel numb.[lr]::
64713::$$$message_0595_0012_0003$$$::My sluggish head can't quite remember who I am. Maybe my blood isn't flowing yet.::
64714::$$$message_0595_0013_0000$$$::"...Oh, right. Sakura, what do you want for breakfast?"[lr]::
64715::$$$message_0595_0013_0001$$$::I pat Sakura, who's sleeping next to me.[lr]::
64716::$$$message_0595_0013_0002$$$::Strangely, all I remember is that we went to sleep next to each other.[lr]::
64717::$$$message_0595_0013_0003$$$::The fact that the girl I love is sleeping next to me must be far more important than silly questions like, "Who am I?"::
64718::$$$message_0595_0014_0000$$$::"Sakura, it's morning. You'd better get up or else there's gonna be a lot of trouble with breakfast and Tohsaka and everything."[lr]::
64719::$$$message_0595_0014_0001$$$::I touch her shoulder a couple more times.[lr]::
64720::$$$message_0595_0014_0002$$$::...Sakura feels cold.[lr]::
64721::$$$message_0595_0014_0003$$$::I don't mean her attitude. She's physically cold and hard to the touch.::
64722::$$$message_0595_0015_0000$$$::"...Sakura?"[lr]::
64723::$$$message_0595_0015_0001$$$::In a haze, I get up and look around the room.::
64724::$$$message_0595_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64725::$$$message_0595_0016_0001$$$::She's not here.[lr]::
64726::$$$message_0595_0016_0002$$$::The sensation of sleeping together and holding her hand tightly so she won't go anywhere is gone. Sakura isn't in the room.::
64727::$$$message_0595_0017_0000$$$::"Sakura!"[lr]::
64728::$$$message_0595_0017_0001$$$::She's nowhere to be found.[lr]::
64729::$$$message_0595_0017_0002$$$::Her room is silent and unused.::
64730::$$$message_0595_0018_0000$$$::There's nobody in the living room.[lr]::
64731::$$$message_0595_0018_0001$$$::"Hah... ngh!"[lr]::
64732::$$$message_0595_0018_0002$$$::I can't move my body very well. I stub a toe on the table as I try to get around it.[lr]::
64733::$$$message_0595_0018_0003$$$::I trip and fall, using the wall to get back up, and I go to the hallway.::
64734::$$$message_0595_0018_0004$$$::"[line4]. [line4], [line4]"[lr]::
64735::$$$message_0595_0018_0005$$$::Am I panicking?[lr]::
64736::$$$message_0595_0018_0006$$$::Nothing feels wrong with my body, but I can't calm down.[lr]::
64737::$$$message_0595_0018_0007$$$::Why am I panicking? What am I anxious about?[lr]::
64738::$$$message_0595_0018_0008$$$::I try to put it into words, but I end up getting lost in thought for ten seconds.::
64739::$$$message_0595_0019_0000$$$::Am I unable to think right now?[lr]::
64740::$$$message_0595_0019_0001$$$::Or does something I've already thought of just fail to come to mind?[lr]::
64741::$$$message_0595_0019_0002$$$::The bloodflow in my just-awakened head is poor, and I can't tell which it is.::
64742::$$$message_0595_0020_0000$$$::"[line4], [line4], [line4]"[lr]::
64743::$$$message_0595_0020_0001$$$::I can't remember what I want to do.[lr]::
64744::$$$message_0595_0020_0002$$$::But I see Sakura's shoes by the front door and breathe a sigh of relief.[lr]::
64745::$$$message_0595_0020_0003$$$::Tohsaka's shoes aren't here. Illya's shoes are.[lr]::
64746::$$$message_0595_0020_0004$$$::What that means is...::
64747::$$$message_0595_0021_0000$$$::"Umm...if her shoes aren't here, then..."::
64748::$$$message_0595_0022_0000$$$::...::
64749::$$$message_0595_0023_0000$$$::"Oh, right. Sakura must be at home, while Tohsaka's the only one outside."[lr]::
64750::$$$message_0595_0023_0001$$$::   So that's why I feel relieved.[lr]::
64751::$$$message_0595_0023_0002$$$::Sakura hasn't gone out anywhere.[lr]::
64752::$$$message_0595_0023_0003$$$::Okay, I'm starting to connect the dots.[lr]::
64753::$$$message_0595_0023_0004$$$::Basically, Sakura woke up first. She must have washed up, made breakfast, trained in the dojo, and did laundry in the backyard.::
64754::$$$message_0595_0024_0000$$$::"Guess I was worried for nothing."[lr]::
64755::$$$message_0595_0024_0001$$$::I sigh and turn back to the living room.[lr]::
64756::$$$message_0595_0024_0002$$$::"Huh, Shirou!?"[lr]::
64757::$$$message_0595_0024_0003$$$::Tohsaka comes running in from the front door.::
64758::$$$message_0595_0025_0000$$$::"What's up, Tohsaka? On a morning walk?"[lr]::
64759::$$$message_0595_0025_0001$$$::"Why would I be taking it easy like that!? We'll talk later![lr]::
64760::$$$message_0595_0025_0002$$$::Sakura collapsed outside, so carry her in! I'll get ready to give her first aid!"::Ã
