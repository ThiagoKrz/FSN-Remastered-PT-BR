13030::$$$message_0130_0000_0000$$$::The park is empty as usual.[lr]::
13031::$$$message_0130_0000_0001$$$::Maybe because it's chillier than usual.[lr]::
13032::$$$message_0130_0000_0002$$$::There's hardly anyone out. It looks like I'm the only one walking around right now.::
13033::$$$message_0130_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
13034::$$$message_0130_0001_0001$$$::I slump down onto a bench.[lr]::
13035::$$$message_0130_0001_0002$$$::Well, I came here to be alone.[lr]::
13036::$$$message_0130_0001_0003$$$::Now that I'm here, I should think of what to do next.::
13037::$$$message_0130_0002_0000$$$::I can't put my decision off any longer.[lr]::
13038::$$$message_0130_0002_0001$$$::If I want to defeat the other Masters and end this Holy Grail War, I need Saber.[lr]::
13039::$$$message_0130_0002_0002$$$::That's not what this is about though. I just don't want to lose Saber.[lr]::
13040::$$$message_0130_0002_0003$$$::But that means...[lr]::
13041::$$$message_0130_0002_0004$$$::I'd have to have Saber attack people, like Rider did.::
13042::$$$message_0130_0003_0000$$$::"...Hngh."[lr]::
13043::$$$message_0130_0003_0001$$$::I can't let her do that.[lr]::
13044::$$$message_0130_0003_0002$$$::Giving Saber that order is as good as telling her to die.[lr]::
13045::$$$message_0130_0003_0003$$$::Besides, I think she'd just refuse outright.[lr]::
13046::$$$message_0130_0003_0004$$$::But...::
13047::$$$message_0130_0004_0000$$$::...when my head slumps down, I see my left hand.[lr]::
13048::$$$message_0130_0004_0001$$$::I have two Command Spells left.[lr]::
13049::$$$message_0130_0004_0002$$$::If I use one, I can force Saber to obey me even if she refuses.::
13050::$$$message_0130_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
13051::$$$message_0130_0005_0001$$$::I bite my lip and shake the thought off. It's ridiculous.[lr]::
13052::$$$message_0130_0005_0002$$$::Time slips by me as I sit on the bench; I have no idea how long I remain sitting there.[lr]::
13053::$$$message_0130_0005_0003$$$::But just as my fingers start to tremble from the cold...::
13054::$$$message_0130_0006_0000$$$::"Ah!!![lr]::
13055::$$$message_0130_0006_0001$$$::I thought I'd never see you again, but you're here!"[lr]::
13056::$$$message_0130_0006_0002$$$::I look up, hearing a voice calling to me.::
13057::$$$message_0130_0007_0000$$$::"Heehee. It really is you. Hello, Shirou. You look down. Did something happen?"::
13058::$$$message_0130_0008_0000$$$::"Illya? Did you come all the way here by yourself again?[lr]::
13059::$$$message_0130_0008_0001$$$:: It's not safe. You never know where Masters are lurking[line2]"::
13060::$$$message_0130_0009_0000$$$::...I'm about to warn her that other Masters might be lurking nearby, waiting to attack. I catch myself, realizing how stupid that would be.[lr]::
13061::$$$message_0130_0009_0001$$$::Illya's a Master.[lr]::
13062::$$$message_0130_0009_0002$$$::I shouldn't be worried about her. We're enemies.::
13063::$$$message_0130_0010_0000$$$::"Sorry. I don't really have time to talk right now. I know we bumped into each other, but I can't talk today. It's going to be really cold, so you should head home."::
13064::$$$message_0130_0011_0000$$$::I don't get up from the bench as I dismiss Illya.[lr]::
13065::$$$message_0130_0011_0001$$$::There are plenty of things I'd like to talk to her about, but I can't think of anything other than Saber right now.::
13066::$$$message_0130_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
13067::$$$message_0130_0012_0001$$$::Hm?[lr]::
13068::$$$message_0130_0012_0002$$$::What's going on?[lr]::
13069::$$$message_0130_0012_0003$$$::Illya doesn't say anything. She's looking at me as if I'm a stranger.::
13070::$$$message_0130_0013_0000$$$::"Illya?[lr]::
13071::$$$message_0130_0013_0001$$$::Sorry. I don't mean to be harsh. I've just...got a lot on my mind right now..."::
13072::$$$message_0130_0014_0000$$$::"I know. Saber's about to disappear, right?[lr]::
13073::$$$message_0130_0014_0001$$$::And you're wondering what to do."[lr]::
13074::$$$message_0130_0014_0002$$$::Just out of nowhere...[lr]::
13075::$$$message_0130_0014_0003$$$::...Illya's voice has gotten so cold and detached.::
13076::$$$message_0130_0015_0000$$$::"Illya?"[lr]::
13077::$$$message_0130_0015_0001$$$::"What a stupid thing to worry about. No wonder you let Rider's Master get away. You just need to kill losers like them."::
13078::$$$message_0130_0016_0000$$$::I move my feet.[lr]::
13079::$$$message_0130_0016_0001$$$::Something tells me this isn't a time to be sitting, so I shift my weight forward to get up.[lr]::
13080::$$$message_0130_0016_0002$$$::   But...[lr]::
13081::$$$message_0130_0016_0003$$$::My body doesn't move, as if I'm entranced by Illya.::
13082::$$$message_0130_0017_0000$$$::"Illya. How do you...know about that?"::
13083::$$$message_0130_0018_0000$$$::"There's not much to explain. I was there last night, at the building.[lr]::
13084::$$$message_0130_0018_0001$$$::I could only watch from inside though."::
13085::$$$message_0130_0019_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
13086::$$$message_0130_0019_0001$$$::I try to make my hands and feet move, but nothing happens.[lr]::
13087::$$$message_0130_0019_0002$$$::No, it feels like the more I try to move, the stiffer they get.[lr]::
13088::$$$message_0130_0019_0003$$$::   It's those eyes.[lr]::
13089::$$$message_0130_0019_0004$$$::Whenever I see Illya's red eyes, my senses go...dull...::
13090::$$$message_0130_0020_0000$$$::"Oh. You're already chained down. [lr]::
13091::$$$message_0130_0020_0001$$$::You really weren't on your guard at all. I thought it'd be easier to capture you if you were all alone, but you're so cute, getting caught so easily."::
13092::$$$message_0130_0021_0000$$$::"Illya, yo...u..."[lr]::
13093::$$$message_0130_0021_0001$$$::"It's no use, brother. You can't move now.[lr]::
13094::$$$message_0130_0021_0002$$$::Soon, you won't be able to talk. But there's nothing to worry about.[lr]::
13095::$$$message_0130_0021_0003$$$::I actually didn't come here to talk today either."::
13096::$$$message_0130_0022_0000$$$::Illya's eyes blaze with murderous intent.[lr]::
13097::$$$message_0130_0022_0001$$$::This is Illya as I saw her the other night: Berserker's Master.::
13098::$$$message_0130_0023_0000$$$::"Kngh...! Do you plan to kill me...right here...!?"[lr]::
13099::$$$message_0130_0023_0001$$$::I grit my teeth and gather all my strength.[lr]::
13100::$$$message_0130_0023_0002$$$::But my fingers won't so much as budge.[lr]::
13101::$$$message_0130_0023_0003$$$::It's like Illya's stare has frozen every nerve in my body.::
13102::$$$message_0130_0024_0000$$$::"Yep. There's no reason for you to remain a Master, right? If Saber disappears, you'll be all alone. I can't have you go on being a Master.[lr]::
13103::$$$message_0130_0024_0001$$$::I can kill you easily if you have no other means to fight."::
13104::$$$message_0130_0025_0000$$$::Illya raises her hand.[lr]::
13105::$$$message_0130_0025_0001$$$::Her slender white fingers reach for my chest.::
13106::$$$message_0130_0026_0000$$$::"I'm glad I found you before the others killed you.[lr]::
13107::$$$message_0130_0026_0001$$$::So good night, brother. Saber's going to disappear anyway, so the sooner the better, right?"::
13108::$$$message_0130_0027_0000$$$::My vision fades.[lr]::
13109::$$$message_0130_0027_0001$$$::My limbs have gone completely numb, and now I can't see either.[lr]::
13110::$$$message_0130_0027_0002$$$::...How long have I been stuck in this darkness?[lr]::
13111::$$$message_0130_0027_0003$$$::Before I can figure out whether I'm alive or dead, I lose consciousness.::
13112::$$$message_0130_0028_0000$$$::...My body is burning.[lr]::
13113::$$$message_0130_0028_0001$$$::Even if my consciousness has fallen into darkness, the burning in my body tells me I'm still alive.[lr]::
13114::$$$message_0130_0028_0002$$$::Yes. That must mean I'm still alive.[lr]::
13115::$$$message_0130_0028_0003$$$::Even so, it may only be temporary.[lr]::
13116::$$$message_0130_0028_0004$$$::Illya even said it.::
13117::$$$message_0130_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"I can kill you easily if you have no other means to fight."[font italic=false]::
13118::$$$message_0130_0030_0000$$$::...She's absolutely right.[lr]::
13119::$$$message_0130_0030_0001$$$::Without Saber, I can't fight a proper battle.[lr]::
13120::$$$message_0130_0030_0002$$$::A Holy Grail War is a battle between Servants.[lr]::
13121::$$$message_0130_0030_0003$$$::And there's no way I can go up against Servants.[lr]::
13122::$$$message_0130_0030_0004$$$::That's been proved more than enough by now.::
13123::$$$message_0130_0031_0000$$$::Each time, I got absolutely thrashed.[lr]::
13124::$$$message_0130_0031_0001$$$::Like Saber said, all I can do against Servants is try to survive for as long as possible.[lr]::
13125::$$$message_0130_0031_0002$$$::I couldn't even do that.[lr]::
13126::$$$message_0130_0031_0003$$$::I was cut to pieces, and even thrown out of a third-story window.[lr]::
13127::$$$message_0130_0031_0004$$$::It's only this weird, inexplicable thing going on with my body that's kept me alive.::
13128::$$$message_0130_0032_0000$$$::It's so frustrating... It makes me so, so angry.[lr]::
13129::$$$message_0130_0032_0001$$$::In the face of an unbeatable opponent, I couldn't stop the catastrophe in front of me on my own.[lr]::
13130::$$$message_0130_0032_0002$$$::Even though I decided to fight.[lr]::
13131::$$$message_0130_0032_0003$$$::I said I was going to fight as a Master and vowed to not hurt anyone, but I couldn't even keep those promises.::
13132::$$$message_0130_0033_0000$$$::   I'm pissed off.[lr]::
13133::$$$message_0130_0033_0001$$$::The champions of justice I strived to emulate when I was young always had to win, or there would be no point.::
13134::$$$message_0130_0034_0000$$$::...My body is burning.[lr]::
13135::$$$message_0130_0034_0001$$$::Every inch of me trembles with the need to win.[lr]::
13136::$$$message_0130_0034_0002$$$::But I have neither the means to win, or even a way to fight.[lr]::
13137::$$$message_0130_0034_0003$$$::What good am I?[lr]::
13138::$$$message_0130_0034_0004$$$::I can't even fight alongside Saber without bringing her down.::
13139::$$$message_0130_0035_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"Another mistake. You're not fit for fighting, Shirou Emiya.[font italic=false][lr]::
13140::$$$message_0130_0035_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Your battle is supposed to be a mental one...[font italic=false][lr]::
13141::$$$message_0130_0035_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...a fight against your own self."[font italic=false]::
13142::$$$message_0130_0036_0000$$$::Suddenly...[lr]::
13143::$$$message_0130_0036_0001$$$::I remember Archer saying that.::
13144::$$$message_0130_0037_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"You haven't got a prayer of winning once the battle starts.[font italic=false][lr]::
13145::$$$message_0130_0037_0001$$$::[font italic=true]None of your skills...[font italic=false][lr]::
13146::$$$message_0130_0037_0002$$$:: [font italic=true]...are worth a damn against Servants."[font italic=false]::
13147::$$$message_0130_0038_0000$$$::I know that.[lr]::
13148::$$$message_0130_0038_0001$$$::I've certainly been reminded more than enough.::
13149::$$$message_0130_0039_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"Then at least imagine it.[font italic=false][lr]::
13150::$$$message_0130_0039_0001$$$::[font italic=true]If you can't possibly beat the opponent in reality, then beat them in your imagination.[font italic=false][lr]::
13151::$$$message_0130_0039_0002$$$::[font italic=true]If you can't win yourself...imagine something that [font italic=false]can[font italic=true] win."[font italic=false]::
13152::$$$message_0130_0040_0000$$$::...You don't have to remind me.[lr]::
13153::$$$message_0130_0040_0001$$$::I can only win in my own head.[lr]::
13154::$$$message_0130_0040_0002$$$::But what can I imagine that would ever help me win?[lr]::
13155::$$$message_0130_0040_0003$$$::I can't imagine beating a Servant.[lr]::
13156::$$$message_0130_0040_0004$$$::I don't have such a wild imagination as to fool myself. Any fantasy I come up with will be full of loose threads that'll come unraveled.[lr]::
13157::$$$message_0130_0040_0005$$$::My third-rate imagination hasn't got a prayer against these incredible Servants.::
13158::$$$message_0130_0041_0000$$$::   That's why...[lr]::
13159::$$$message_0130_0041_0001$$$::Who do I win against...[lr]::
13160::$$$message_0130_0041_0002$$$::And how do I win?[lr]::
13161::$$$message_0130_0041_0003$$$::I'm still searching for that answer...::
13162::$$$message_0130_0042_0000$$$::    Am I really searching for it?[lr]::
13163::$$$message_0130_0042_0001$$$::That golden sword.[lr]::
13164::$$$message_0130_0042_0002$$$::It's meant only for her.[lr]::
13165::$$$message_0130_0042_0003$$$::I don't want it for myself...[lr]::
13166::$$$message_0130_0042_0004$$$::It's just... It's so beautiful.[lr]::
13167::$$$message_0130_0042_0005$$$::Just once, I'd like to hold it in my hands if I can.::
13168::$$$message_0130_0043_0000$$$::...Ugh. I guess this is just a bad habit I've picked up as an untrained mage.[lr]::
13169::$$$message_0130_0043_0001$$$::Since all I can do is look within myself, I tend to dream about stuff I shouldn't.[lr]::
13170::$$$message_0130_0043_0002$$$::I should at least be allowed to dream.::
13171::$$$message_0130_0044_0000$$$::First, I imagine the thing's basic structure, then reproduce it.[lr]::
13172::$$$message_0130_0044_0001$$$::...Heh. I guess there's not much point in Strengthening here.[lr]::
13173::$$$message_0130_0044_0002$$$::If Strengthening is the act of applying something to an existing object, there's not much point in doing that to something that doesn't even exist.[lr]::
13174::$$$message_0130_0044_0003$$$::That means I need to work harder if I'm going to remember that sword.::
13175::$$$message_0130_0045_0000$$$::   This is well before the basics.[lr]::
13176::$$$message_0130_0045_0001$$$::This is from before Kiritsugu taught me Strengthening...a magecraft process that I thought up on my own, and packed with trivial steps.::
13177::$$$message_0130_0046_0000$$$::Let's see... How did I do it? How did I give it form...?::
13178::$$$message_0130_0047_0000$$$::...When I come to, I have no idea where I am.::
13179::$$$message_0130_0048_0000$$$::"Where...am I...?"[lr]::
13180::$$$message_0130_0048_0001$$$::This place isn't just unfamiliar.[lr]::
13181::$$$message_0130_0048_0002$$$::There's a luxurious canopy bed, and the plush carpet is ankle-deep.[lr]::
13182::$$$message_0130_0048_0003$$$::There's even a stone fireplace, and it's clearly not just a decoration.::
13183::$$$message_0130_0049_0000$$$::What I initially take for wallpaper I realize, on inspection, is actually patterns engraved on the wall.[lr]::
13184::$$$message_0130_0049_0001$$$::I've gotten used to fancy decorations like the ones in Shinji's mansion, but this is something else entirely.[lr]::
13185::$$$message_0130_0049_0002$$$::It's a little embarrassing to say this out loud, but this place is like a castle from a fairy tale.::
13186::$$$message_0130_0050_0000$$$::"...Ngh."[lr]::
13187::$$$message_0130_0050_0001$$$::My vision blurs.[lr]::
13188::$$$message_0130_0050_0002$$$::My body feels strangely heavy.[lr]::
13189::$$$message_0130_0050_0003$$$::Maybe I'm having circulation problems or something? I feel like I might fall back asleep if I relax even a little.::
13190::$$$message_0130_0051_0000$$$::"Um...what the hell happened?"[lr]::
13191::$$$message_0130_0051_0001$$$::I try to get my clouded mind working.[lr]::
13192::$$$message_0130_0051_0002$$$::I was...oh right. Illya paralyzed me and I just passed out.::
13193::$$$message_0130_0052_0000$$$::"So, Illya's captured me..."[lr]::
13194::$$$message_0130_0052_0001$$$::There's nobody in the room.[lr]::
13195::$$$message_0130_0052_0002$$$::My body feels heavy, but not so bad that I can't even lift a finger like before.[lr]::
13196::$$$message_0130_0052_0003$$$::If I really work at it, I might be able to lift an arm.::
13197::$$$message_0130_0053_0000$$$::"What the...!? I'm tied up!"[lr]::
13198::$$$message_0130_0053_0001$$$::My drowsy mind suddenly jolts to full alertness.[lr]::
13199::$$$message_0130_0053_0002$$$::I realize I'm in danger, and so study my surroundings carefully.::
13200::$$$message_0130_0054_0000$$$::"I'm in a chair. My hands are bound behind my back. I'm handcuffed... No. My wrists are just tied with rope."[lr]::
13201::$$$message_0130_0054_0001$$$::It's not as bad as I imagined, but I still can't move.[lr]::
13202::$$$message_0130_0054_0002$$$::My whole body is weirdly...tingly, and I can't get up with my arms tied behind me.::
13203::$$$message_0130_0055_0000$$$::"I wonder how long I've been here. Is there a... No, no clock here."[lr]::
13204::$$$message_0130_0055_0001$$$::There's nothing in here to tell me what time it is.[lr]::
13205::$$$message_0130_0055_0002$$$::A window... There's a window behind me.[lr]::
13206::$$$message_0130_0055_0003$$$::I try to turn and get a look, but the curtains are closed, so I can't see outside.[lr]::
13207::$$$message_0130_0055_0004$$$::All I can say for sure is that the sun's set.[lr]::
13208::$$$message_0130_0055_0005$$$::I ran into Illya in the morning, so it's been at least half a day.::
13209::$$$message_0130_0056_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
13210::$$$message_0130_0056_0001$$$::I don't have time for this.[lr]::
13211::$$$message_0130_0056_0002$$$::I have no idea where I am, but I need to get back to Saber as fast as I can.[lr]::
13212::$$$message_0130_0056_0003$$$::...Saber's in a weakened state.[lr]::
13213::$$$message_0130_0056_0004$$$::I can't be even more of a burden to her by letting something like this happen!::
13214::$$$message_0130_0057_0000$$$::"Hngh!"[lr]::
13215::$$$message_0130_0057_0001$$$::I try to make my arms move.[lr]::
13216::$$$message_0130_0057_0002$$$::If I'm going to escape, I have to do something about these ropes around my wrists.::
13217::$$$message_0130_0058_0000$$$::"Ah!?"[lr]::
13218::$$$message_0130_0058_0001$$$::The door opens.[lr]::
13219::$$$message_0130_0058_0002$$$::I go still just as Illya enters the room.::
13220::$$$message_0130_0059_0000$$$::"Oh, you finally woke up! Morning, brother! How are you feeling?"[lr]::
13221::$$$message_0130_0059_0001$$$::Illya's not acting at all like she had earlier.[lr]::
13222::$$$message_0130_0059_0002$$$::The coldness in her eyes is gone, and she's back to acting like the cheerful girl she'd been at the park the other day.::
13223::$$$message_0130_0060_0000$$$::"Hm? What's wrong? You don't look so good. You still can't move? That's weird. You should at least be able to talk by now."[lr]::
13224::$$$message_0130_0060_0001$$$::Illya peers into my face, looking puzzled.[lr]::
13225::$$$message_0130_0060_0002$$$::She seems genuinely concerned for me.::
13226::$$$message_0130_0061_0000$$$::"I'm fine. I can talk, and my mind's clear enough to understand that I've been captured."::
13227::$$$message_0130_0062_0000$$$::"Oh, are you complaining? Did you know prisoners are usually supposed to go into the basement cell?"[lr]::
13228::$$$message_0130_0062_0001$$$::But I felt bad at the thought of doing that to you, so I brought you to my room."[lr]::
13229::$$$message_0130_0062_0002$$$::I don't know if that's good or bad.[lr]::
13230::$$$message_0130_0062_0003$$$::But at least I understand what's going on a little better.::
13231::$$$message_0130_0063_0000$$$::"I'm getting a clearer picture of what happened. I've been captured, and this is where you live."[lr]::
13232::$$$message_0130_0063_0001$$$::I speak flatly, trying to kill my emotions.[lr]::
13233::$$$message_0130_0063_0002$$$::Until I understand completely what's happening here, I just need to listen.::
13234::$$$message_0130_0064_0000$$$::"That's right. Remember I told you I live in a castle in a forest?"::
13235::$$$message_0130_0065_0000$$$::"This is a castle in the middle of a biiig forest. There's nothing else around. It takes a few hours by car just to get to your city. There's no chance of a rescue out here, and nobody will come bother us either."::
13236::$$$message_0130_0066_0000$$$::"I see.[lr]::
13237::$$$message_0130_0066_0001$$$::Okay, but why did you do this?[lr]::
13238::$$$message_0130_0066_0002$$$::If you were going to kill me, you could've done it at the park."::
13239::$$$message_0130_0067_0000$$$::"Why would I? I don't intend to kill you. You're mine. I'll kill the other Masters, but you're special.[lr]::
13240::$$$message_0130_0067_0001$$$::I locked you up here so that nobody could bother us."::
13241::$$$message_0130_0068_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
13242::$$$message_0130_0068_0001$$$::I find myself recoiling.[lr]::
13243::$$$message_0130_0068_0002$$$::Illya pushes her face closer to me, ignoring my agitation.::
13244::$$$message_0130_0069_0000$$$::"I-Illya...what are you...!?"[lr]::
13245::$$$message_0130_0069_0001$$$::I-I know it's inappropriate, but the way Illya sits on my lap has my heart racing.[lr]::
13246::$$$message_0130_0069_0002$$$::She may not be heavy, but the way she's sitting on my lap has me thinking...kinda graphic thoughts.::
13247::$$$message_0130_0070_0000$$$::"Yep. I knew it. You're special, Shirou.[lr]::
13248::$$$message_0130_0070_0001$$$::Hey. Want to be my Servant? If you say you'll be my Servant, I won't kill you. If you just nod, I'll spare you."::
13249::$$$message_0130_0071_0000$$$::Illya's words are so pure and heartfelt, I know that if I nod even once, it'll be a choice I can't unmake...and I will absolutely come to regret it.[lr]::
13250::$$$message_0130_0071_0001$$$::...On the other hand, if I refuse, that purity will turn into pure wickedness.::
13251::$$$message_0130_0072_0000$$$::With Illya leaning so close, my mind grinds to a shrieking halt.[lr]::
13252::$$$message_0130_0072_0001$$$::She's not saying this just because she likes me.[lr]::
13253::$$$message_0130_0072_0002$$$::This is more like an interrogation, a matter of whether I want to live or die.::
13254::$$$message_0130_0073_0000$$$::"This is a no-brainer. You don't have Saber anymore. You don't have a way of fighting.[lr]::
13255::$$$message_0130_0073_0001$$$::That means there's no reason for you to remain a Master."::
13256::$$$message_0130_0074_0000$$$::"No. Saber hasn't disappeared yet. And I'm not going to let it happen."::
13257::$$$message_0130_0075_0000$$$::"Oh really? But it would be so easy to kill you in your state.[lr]::
13258::$$$message_0130_0075_0001$$$::Just give in and stay here. If you stay by my side forever, I'll protect you forever."::
13259::$$$message_0130_0076_0000$$$::Illya presses close against me.[lr]::
13260::$$$message_0130_0076_0001$$$::...I'm not sure what'll happen if I refuse.[lr]::
13261::$$$message_0130_0076_0002$$$::But I still can't agree.::
13262::$$$message_0130_0077_0000$$$::"I can't. Step away, Illya. No matter what you say, I..."[lr]::
13263::$$$message_0130_0077_0001$$$::Illya presses her index finger to my lips.[lr]::
13264::$$$message_0130_0077_0002$$$::She giggles in amusement and watches me in my bewilderment.::
13265::$$$message_0130_0078_0000$$$::"You really don't understand.[lr]::
13266::$$$message_0130_0078_0001$$$::Listen. You're like a bird in a cage. It's my decision whether to keep you alive or kill you. You shouldn't say anything that might make me mad.[lr]::
13267::$$$message_0130_0078_0002$$$::I've waited ten years for this. Killing you quickly would just be boring."::
13268::$$$message_0130_0079_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
13269::$$$message_0130_0079_0001$$$::Illya talks like she's asking for a toy.[lr]::
13270::$$$message_0130_0079_0002$$$::The sheer cold-heartedness in her voice sends a shiver down my spine.::
13271::$$$message_0130_0080_0000$$$::"This is your last chance, brother. I'm only asking this one more time."[lr]::
13272::$$$message_0130_0080_0001$$$::Illya's eyes shine with hope.[lr]::
13273::$$$message_0130_0080_0002$$$::"Shirou...be [font italic=true]mine[font italic=false]."[lr]::
13274::$$$message_0130_0080_0003$$$::Illya's tone is bewitching and brooks no refusal.::
