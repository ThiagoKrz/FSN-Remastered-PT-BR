37858::$$$message_0326_0000_0001$$$::My body feels heavy.[lr]::
37859::$$$message_0326_0000_0002$$$::I feel awful as I wake as I'm immediately assaulted by a headache.::
37860::$$$message_0326_0001_0000$$$::"...I wonder if it's because of my injury from yesterday. My right arm still slightly hurts."[lr]::
37861::$$$message_0326_0001_0001$$$::I mutter while getting up.[lr]::
37862::$$$message_0326_0001_0002$$$::It's already past 6 AM.::
37863::$$$message_0326_0002_0000$$$::"Crap, I should be making breakfast...!"[lr]::
37864::$$$message_0326_0002_0001$$$::I jump out of bed and change quickly.[lr]::
37865::$$$message_0326_0002_0002$$$::Fuji-nee and Sakura have morning practice.[lr]::
37866::$$$message_0326_0002_0003$$$::They leave at 6:30 AM, so I won't make it unless I hurry.::
37867::$$$message_0326_0003_0000$$$::After I see them off, I drink tea with Saber after breakfast.[lr]::
37868::$$$message_0326_0003_0001$$$::The morning goes by in a whirlwind and before I know it, it's past 7 AM.::
37869::$$$message_0326_0004_0000$$$::"I'm gonna get going. Take care while I'm gone, Saber."[lr]::
37870::$$$message_0326_0004_0001$$$::"Yes. Please be careful yourself as well. Please do not do anything reckless just because you have Rin's help."[lr]::
37871::$$$message_0326_0004_0002$$$::"Yeah, I learned from yesterday. I'll ask for your help if I go after an enemy."::
37872::$$$message_0326_0005_0000$$$::I wave goodbye to Saber and leave.[lr]::
37873::$$$message_0326_0005_0001$$$::The morning air is peaceful.[lr]::
37874::$$$message_0326_0005_0002$$$::But the school that I'm about to head to is completely different.::
37875::$$$message_0326_0006_0000$$$::"...All right."[lr]::
37876::$$$message_0326_0006_0001$$$::I brace myself as I go down the hill.[lr]::
37877::$$$message_0326_0006_0002$$$::Tohsaka is a right and proper Master. I need to step up, or I'll just make a fool of myself.::
37878::$$$message_0326_0007_0000$$$::I greet my classmates as I get to my seat...[lr]::
37879::$$$message_0326_0007_0001$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
37880::$$$message_0326_0007_0002$$$::Along the way...[lr]::
37881::$$$message_0326_0007_0003$$$::I make eye contact with an unexpected person, and I'm momentarily at a loss for words.::
37882::$$$message_0326_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]Are you serious?[font italic=false][lr]::
37883::$$$message_0326_0008_0001$$$::It's instinctive.[lr]::
37884::$$$message_0326_0008_0002$$$::I storm towards Shinji.[lr]::
37885::$$$message_0326_0008_0003$$$::"Shinji, you...!"::
37886::$$$message_0326_0009_0000$$$::"Hey, Emiya. What's going on? You're looking a little scary this morning. What, did something happen while I was gone?"[lr]::
37887::$$$message_0326_0009_0001$$$::"Cut it out. What did you do to Mitsuzuri?"::
37888::$$$message_0326_0010_0000$$$::"Mitsuzuri...? Oh, Ayako. It seems like she ran away from home. I heard about it this morning at the range, too. So she was found in Shinto, huh?"[lr]::
37889::$$$message_0326_0010_0001$$$::None of this is funny, but Shinji laughs.[lr]::
37890::$$$message_0326_0010_0002$$$::The look in his eyes tells me he's delighted by mocking Mitsuzuri.::
37891::$$$message_0326_0011_0000$$$::"...Don't play dumb. You're the last person who talked to her. I'm asking you what you did to her then."::
37892::$$$message_0326_0012_0000$$$::"Huh? We only chatted for a bit.[lr]::
37893::$$$message_0326_0012_0001$$$::More importantly, did you hear, Emiya!? They found her on the ground in a back alley. I heard she was all dizzy and her uniform was messed up.[lr]::
37894::$$$message_0326_0012_0002$$$::Man, I don't know what happened, but you gotta be curious, right? About how that bitchy brat got trashed."::
37895::$$$message_0326_0013_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
37896::$$$message_0326_0013_0001$$$::"Why the scary face? It's just a joke. Don't take it so seriously. Ayako's being looked after, right? I think she's resting at home. Well, I guess it'll be harder for her once she comes back, since the rumors will have spread by then."::
37897::$$$message_0326_0014_0000$$$::"...Hey. Are you saying you told everyone in the kyudo club about this?"[lr]::
37898::$$$message_0326_0014_0001$$$::"Maybe. But all the first years know about it already. It's not a telephone game, but I hear the rumor's been making it around."::
37899::$$$message_0326_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
37900::$$$message_0326_0015_0001$$$::I can feel my fists clenching, and clamp down on the urge I'm feeling.[lr]::
37901::$$$message_0326_0015_0002$$$::Did he go around telling everyone such a story?[lr]::
37902::$$$message_0326_0015_0003$$$::Mitsuzuri is a girl. Everyone knows she's strong, but even so.[lr]::
37903::$$$message_0326_0015_0004$$$::Regardless of how strong she is, rumors like that have a way of eating away at anybody.::
37904::$$$message_0326_0016_0000$$$::Did he go around telling everyone knowing that?[lr]::
37905::$$$message_0326_0016_0001$$$::It's being kept from everybody for a reason, but he's deliberately spreading rumors to hurt her...!::
37906::$$$message_0326_0017_0000$$$::"...Shinji, you...!"[lr]::
37907::$$$message_0326_0017_0001$$$::I grab his shoulders.[lr]::
37908::$$$message_0326_0017_0002$$$::"Don't glare at me like that. I said I don't know anything about it. Don't say something you'll regret, Emiya."[lr]::
37909::$$$message_0326_0017_0003$$$::Shrugging out of my grip, Shinji goes to his seat.::
37910::$$$message_0326_0018_0000$$$::The homeroom bell rings.[lr]::
37911::$$$message_0326_0018_0001$$$::"Khh..."[lr]::
37912::$$$message_0326_0018_0002$$$::I can't stay standing here.[lr]::
37913::$$$message_0326_0018_0003$$$::With a glance at Shinji, I am forced to make my way back to my seat.::
