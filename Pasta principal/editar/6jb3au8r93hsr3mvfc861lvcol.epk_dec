21783::$$$message_0196_0000_0001$$$::She doesn't answer.[lr]::
21784::$$$message_0196_0000_0002$$$::Blood spurts from her mouth as she tries to gasp.::
21785::$$$message_0196_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21786::$$$message_0196_0001_0001$$$::The world goes red.[lr]::
21787::$$$message_0196_0001_0002$$$::   [font italic=true]What was I doing?[font italic=false][lr]::
21788::$$$message_0196_0001_0003$$$::I knew this would happen.[lr]::
21789::$$$message_0196_0001_0004$$$::I knew Saber couldn't win against Gilgamesh, so why didn't I try to stop her, even if I had to use a Command Spell?::
21790::$$$message_0196_0002_0000$$$::"What a bore. Not even a challenge.[lr]::
21791::$$$message_0196_0002_0001$$$::I'm disappointed you were so easily defeated, Saber. Ah, my mistake. I should have gone easy on you. You are just a woman, after all!"[lr]::
21792::$$$message_0196_0002_0002$$$::His smug voice is grating.[lr]::
21793::$$$message_0196_0002_0003$$$::This is my fault.::
21794::$$$message_0196_0003_0000$$$::I thought she could win.[lr]::
21795::$$$message_0196_0003_0001$$$::As bad a feeling as I had about this, I was sure Excalibur would win.[lr]::
21796::$$$message_0196_0003_0002$$$::I may have told her to stop, but my Command Spell didn't react.::
21797::$$$message_0196_0004_0000$$$::I obviously wasn't serious.[lr]::
21798::$$$message_0196_0004_0001$$$::If I'd been serious about protecting her, I could have used a Command Spell to make her escape, even if it was just her... And there would have at least been options for me to fight on my own.::
21799::$$$message_0196_0005_0000$$$::"So, it's time for me to collect what's mine. She's gotten a little dirty, but no matter. She was going to end up that way anyway. A scratch here or there makes no difference."::
21800::$$$message_0196_0006_0000$$$::His voice draws closer.[lr]::
21801::$$$message_0196_0006_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21802::$$$message_0196_0006_0002$$$::Saber must have come to. I see her eyes open.::
21803::$$$message_0196_0007_0000$$$::"Saber! Are you alright!?"[lr]::
21804::$$$message_0196_0007_0001$$$::I can see her breathing, yet I'm still far enough away that I can't reach her.[lr]::
21805::$$$message_0196_0007_0002$$$::She lays still, but I can't run to her.[lr]::
21806::$$$message_0196_0007_0003$$$::All I can do is call out to her.::
21807::$$$message_0196_0008_0000$$$::"Saber! Saber, Saber!!!"[lr]::
21808::$$$message_0196_0008_0001$$$::"...Ah...hg..."::
21809::$$$message_0196_0009_0000$$$::Saber's mouth opens.[lr]::
21810::$$$message_0196_0009_0001$$$::She breathes in as if to ask for help, but even that is painful enough to send her into a coughing fit.::
21811::$$$message_0196_0010_0000$$$::"Shirou...? Are you...there?"[lr]::
21812::$$$message_0196_0010_0001$$$::Her voice is weak, and the question makes clear she can't see me.::
21813::$$$message_0196_0011_0000$$$::"Hold on, I'll..."[lr]::
21814::$$$message_0196_0011_0001$$$::I can't very well say I'll help.[lr]::
21815::$$$message_0196_0011_0002$$$::I'm on the ground too, and can only move one arm.[lr]::
21816::$$$message_0196_0011_0003$$$::I can't even offer words of encouragement.[lr]::
21817::$$$message_0196_0011_0004$$$::At least she can't see me in this pathetic state.::
21818::$$$message_0196_0012_0000$$$::"Oh...I see. I must have lost."[lr]::
21819::$$$message_0196_0012_0001$$$::She tilts her head toward me, her eyes lifeless.[lr]::
21820::$$$message_0196_0012_0002$$$::"I am sorry... Please, escape...even if you must do so alone, Master."[lr]::
21821::$$$message_0196_0012_0003$$$::Saber coughs up blood.::
21822::$$$message_0196_0013_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21823::$$$message_0196_0013_0001$$$::Anger seizes me, and I see red.[lr]::
21824::$$$message_0196_0013_0002$$$::I'd been relying on Saber, and this is the result.[lr]::
21825::$$$message_0196_0013_0003$$$::I took one hit, and I can't even get up.[lr]::
21826::$$$message_0196_0013_0004$$$::   I grab my head with the one hand that still works.[lr]::
21827::$$$message_0196_0013_0005$$$::I could just about kill myself.[lr]::
21828::$$$message_0196_0013_0006$$$::I have every intention of crushing my head, and so pour all the strength I can into my hand.::
21829::$$$message_0196_0014_0000$$$::The switch fails.[lr]::
21830::$$$message_0196_0014_0001$$$::Instead of using my finger, I imagine a hammer to press the switch to change myself into a mage.::
21831::$$$message_0196_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"Don't ever use it again. Projection is beyond your abilities." [font italic=false][r][wsay canskip=1]::
21832::$$$message_0196_0015_0001$$$::I hear Tohsaka's voice.[lr]::
21833::$$$message_0196_0015_0002$$$::She said that trying to do magecraft beyond your abilities will destroy the caster's nerves and Magic Circuits.::
21834::$$$message_0196_0016_0000$$$::So what?[lr]::
21835::$$$message_0196_0016_0001$$$::Saber's more important than any of that. If I can't protect her, I don't need my head anyway.[lr]::
21836::$$$message_0196_0016_0002$$$::She's saved me so many times.[lr]::
21837::$$$message_0196_0016_0003$$$::I've never cared about someone the way I care about her.[lr]::
21838::$$$message_0196_0016_0004$$$::So...[lr]::
21839::$$$message_0196_0016_0005$$$::If I can't protect her, I'm better off dead.::
21840::$$$message_0196_0017_0000$$$::I hear the pounding of iron.[lr]::
21841::$$$message_0196_0017_0001$$$::The shattered bones of my body are being reinforced by magical energy.[lr]::
21842::$$$message_0196_0017_0002$$$::There's no holding back.[lr]::
21843::$$$message_0196_0017_0003$$$::I throw my switch open wide. Ignoring my own limits, I generate as much magical energy as I can.::
21844::$$$message_0196_0018_0000$$$::"...Ghhhg."[lr]::
21845::$$$message_0196_0018_0001$$$::My spine ignites, and my entire body grows red hot.[lr]::
21846::$$$message_0196_0018_0002$$$::My brain feels like it's melting, and I bite my tongue to endure it.[lr]::
21847::$$$message_0196_0018_0003$$$::My teeth sink into the fleshy muscle.[lr]::
21848::$$$message_0196_0018_0004$$$::If I have to bite a hole in my tongue to remain conscious, so be it.::
21849::$$$message_0196_0019_0000$$$::"What?"[lr]::
21850::$$$message_0196_0019_0001$$$::The footsteps stop.[lr]::
21851::$$$message_0196_0019_0002$$$::Gilgamesh's amused laughter stops with them.::
21852::$$$message_0196_0020_0000$$$::"Wha...Shirou...?[lr]::
21853::$$$message_0196_0020_0001$$$::Wh-what are you doing!? You mustn't...or your body will...!"[lr]::
21854::$$$message_0196_0020_0002$$$::She must sense something, even without being able to see.[lr]::
21855::$$$message_0196_0020_0003$$$::Saber screams as she tries desperately to push herself up.::
21856::$$$message_0196_0021_0000$$$::   Something in me snaps.[lr]::
21857::$$$message_0196_0021_0001$$$::I stand up.[lr]::
21858::$$$message_0196_0021_0002$$$::My body tries to ignore my orders, but it begins to move with the help of the surge of magical energy I pour into it.[lr]::
21859::$$$message_0196_0021_0003$$$::It's like being set on fire and instinctively running toward water in hopes of surviving.::
21860::$$$message_0196_0022_0000$$$::I don't care.[lr]::
21861::$$$message_0196_0022_0001$$$::It's better than seeing Saber like that.[lr]::
21862::$$$message_0196_0022_0002$$$::Oh, right.[lr]::
21863::$$$message_0196_0022_0003$$$::With my mind very nearly burning up, I finally realize...[lr]::
21864::$$$message_0196_0022_0004$$$::...from the beginning...[lr]::
21865::$$$message_0196_0022_0005$$$::...I vowed to wield my sword because I didn't want her to get hurt.::
21866::$$$message_0196_0023_0000$$$::"What!? I told you to flee...so why!?"::
21867::$$$message_0196_0024_0000$$$::I stop the enemy from approaching.[lr]::
21868::$$$message_0196_0024_0001$$$::Saber is behind me on the ground.[lr]::
21869::$$$message_0196_0024_0002$$$::This is it.[lr]::
21870::$$$message_0196_0024_0003$$$::There's no way I can retreat now.::
21871::$$$message_0196_0025_0000$$$::"Trace, on."[lr]::
21872::$$$message_0196_0025_0001$$$::I restrain my panicking, burning body and focus my will.[lr]::
21873::$$$message_0196_0025_0002$$$::I need to imagine one, single thing.[lr]::
21874::$$$message_0196_0025_0003$$$::I divide the projection into eight sections, and replicate the lost sword.::
21875::$$$message_0196_0026_0000$$$::There's something solid in my left hand.[lr]::
21876::$$$message_0196_0026_0001$$$::I don't even have to look. [lr]::
21877::$$$message_0196_0026_0002$$$::My second attempt at manufacturing the sword succeeds.::
21878::$$$message_0196_0027_0000$$$::"My...sword? N-no, that is not right. You should know very well that we still cannot win against him![lr]::
21879::$$$message_0196_0027_0001$$$::If you can move, you have to ru[line2]"::
21880::$$$message_0196_0028_0000$$$::"I'm not running. I came here to get you. No way am I going home alone."[lr]::
21881::$$$message_0196_0028_0001$$$::I ready the sword.[lr]::
21882::$$$message_0196_0028_0002$$$::I hold it in both hands[line2]it's so much heavier than the bamboo sword[line2]and glare at Gilgamesh.::
21883::$$$message_0196_0029_0000$$$::"N-no...stop, Shirou. He is..."[lr]::
21884::$$$message_0196_0029_0001$$$::I ignore Saber's words and take a step forward.::
21885::$$$message_0196_0030_0000$$$::There's about four meters between us.[lr]::
21886::$$$message_0196_0030_0001$$$::If I rush at him with all my might, maybe I can cut him down.[lr]::
21887::$$$message_0196_0030_0002$$$::He doesn't move.[lr]::
21888::$$$message_0196_0030_0003$$$::Gilgamesh watches me for a moment, then laughs.[lr]::
21889::$$$message_0196_0030_0004$$$::"I suppose I'll kill you, then."[lr]::
21890::$$$message_0196_0030_0005$$$::His voice is utterly devoid of emotion.::
21891::$$$message_0196_0031_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
21892::$$$message_0196_0031_0001$$$::I instinctively block the attack that comes my way.[lr]::
21893::$$$message_0196_0031_0002$$$::"Hngh...why you...!"[lr]::
21894::$$$message_0196_0031_0003$$$::I dodge the surprise attack by swaying sideways.::
21895::$$$message_0196_0032_0000$$$::"Hnnngh!!!"[lr]::
21896::$$$message_0196_0032_0001$$$::Too slow.[lr]::
21897::$$$message_0196_0032_0002$$$::If the first attack is a sudden gust, the barrage of attacks that follows is like a storm.[lr]::
21898::$$$message_0196_0032_0003$$$::"Ha...ku...ngggh...guh!"[lr]::
21899::$$$message_0196_0032_0004$$$::Blocking is all I can do.[lr]::
21900::$$$message_0196_0032_0005$$$::Actually, I wouldn't have even been able to block the first attack on my own.::
21901::$$$message_0196_0033_0000$$$::Fortunately, when I reproduced the sword, I also reproduced its memory.[lr]::
21902::$$$message_0196_0033_0001$$$::A sword that's been in so many battles gains a will of its own after all that experience.[lr]::
21903::$$$message_0196_0033_0002$$$::This sword must have already mastered this particular dance.[lr]::
21904::$$$message_0196_0033_0003$$$::I can't follow Gilgamesh's attacks, but the sword seems to be able to.::
21905::$$$message_0196_0034_0000$$$::Before I move my arm, the sword is already reacting to Gilgamesh's attacks.[lr]::
21906::$$$message_0196_0034_0001$$$::I let the sword guide me, and manage to parry Gilgamesh's fierce attack.::
21907::$$$message_0196_0035_0000$$$::"Haa...haah...aaah!"[lr]::
21908::$$$message_0196_0035_0001$$$::It doesn't last long.[lr]::
21909::$$$message_0196_0035_0002$$$::Every time I swing the sword, my fingers go numb, and I find myself gradually lagging more and more behind the sword's guidance.::
21910::$$$message_0196_0036_0000$$$::"You mongrel. This is beyond unseemly."[lr]::
21911::$$$message_0196_0036_0001$$$::Gilgamesh must not be able to tolerate even the slightest bit of resistance from me.[lr]::
21912::$$$message_0196_0036_0002$$$::He glares hatefully at me as he backs up just the slightest bit.::
21913::$$$message_0196_0037_0000$$$::"Ah...haaah...ha...aaah!"[lr]::
21914::$$$message_0196_0037_0001$$$::I'm saved.[lr]::
21915::$$$message_0196_0037_0002$$$::If he'd kept attacking, I wouldn't have lasted another second.[lr]::
21916::$$$message_0196_0037_0003$$$::I try to catch my breath.[lr]::
21917::$$$message_0196_0037_0004$$$::    And then...::
21918::$$$message_0196_0038_0000$$$::"You filthy faker. If you are so enamored of it, I will show you the real thing."[lr]::
21919::$$$message_0196_0038_0001$$$::He draws a sword.::
21920::$$$message_0196_0039_0000$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
21921::$$$message_0196_0039_0001$$$::It looks...familiar.[lr]::
21922::$$$message_0196_0039_0002$$$::The decorations are different though.[lr]::
21923::$$$message_0196_0039_0003$$$::The thought that went into making that sword, as well as its soul, are too similar to this sword.::
21924::$$$message_0196_0040_0000$$$::"Don't tell me...the prototype of this sword..."::
21925::$$$message_0196_0041_0000$$$::"That's right. But its precision as a Noble Phantasm is without equal.[lr]::
21926::$$$message_0196_0041_0001$$$::The 'sword in the stone' you hold now originated with the Norse legend of the sword impaled in the tree of supremacy. And this...this sword is the prototype for both. This sword serves as the very foundation of the concept of the divine right of kings."::
21927::$$$message_0196_0042_0000$$$::Is he saying he's holding the original model for the sword in the tree of supremacy...the Norse hero Sigmund's demonic sword, Gram?::
21928::$$$message_0196_0043_0000$$$::"No child surpasses their parent. Replicas deteriorate with each iteration, and are no match for the original!"[lr]::
21929::$$$message_0196_0043_0001$$$::Light flares from the blade.[lr]::
21930::$$$message_0196_0043_0002$$$::The sword understands perfectly that this is the same attack which killed Berserker in a single strike.::
21931::$$$message_0196_0044_0000$$$::"Angh!"[lr]::
21932::$$$message_0196_0044_0001$$$::It must be protecting its owner.[lr]::
21933::$$$message_0196_0044_0002$$$::The sword in my hand moves toward the enemy's sword, more fiercely, more powerfully than ever before.[lr]::
21934::$$$message_0196_0044_0003$$$::The Noble Phantasm is called Caliburn, the Golden Sword of Assured Victory. But...[lr]::
21935::$$$message_0196_0044_0004$$$::...it shatters instantly in the face of Merodach, the Original Sin.::
21936::$$$message_0196_0045_0000$$$::I hear something sliding along the ground.[lr]::
21937::$$$message_0196_0045_0001$$$::It's a faint, rustling sound.[lr]::
21938::$$$message_0196_0045_0002$$$::Is the park's ground slippery?[lr]::
21939::$$$message_0196_0045_0003$$$::I roll across the ground like a bit of trash in the wind before finally coming to a stop.::
21940::$$$message_0196_0046_0000$$$::"Shirou...! Shirou, SHIROU!!!"[lr]::
21941::$$$message_0196_0046_0001$$$::Her voice tells me I'm still alive.::
21942::$$$message_0196_0047_0000$$$::"Oh, there you are, Saber."[lr]::
21943::$$$message_0196_0047_0001$$$::I'm relieved to see that.[lr]::
21944::$$$message_0196_0047_0002$$$::I thought I'd been blown away, but it doesn't matter since Saber's here.[lr]::
21945::$$$message_0196_0047_0003$$$::And then, as long as I can stand up, I can run to her.::
21946::$$$message_0196_0048_0000$$$::"Ah...h"[lr]::
21947::$$$message_0196_0048_0001$$$::I glance at my arm.[lr]::
21948::$$$message_0196_0048_0002$$$::It's red.[lr]::
21949::$$$message_0196_0048_0003$$$::My arm is covered in some sort of sticky red membrane, but there's no blood coming from it.::
21950::$$$message_0196_0049_0000$$$::"Do not move! Please...please do not move, Shirou!"[lr]::
21951::$$$message_0196_0049_0001$$$::Saber's shouts reach me as I lay there, staring at my arm.[lr]::
21952::$$$message_0196_0049_0002$$$::It looks like my torso is what's hurt.::
21953::$$$message_0196_0050_0000$$$::That single attack...[lr]::
21954::$$$message_0196_0050_0001$$$::I'm pretty sure Gilgamesh's sword is what sent me flying.[lr]::
21955::$$$message_0196_0050_0002$$$::That at least explains why I'm injured.[lr]::
21956::$$$message_0196_0050_0003$$$::No wonder Saber's so upset.::
21957::$$$message_0196_0051_0000$$$::The only thing I can move is my right hand.[lr]::
21958::$$$message_0196_0051_0001$$$::My left hand doesn't move.[lr]::
21959::$$$message_0196_0051_0002$$$::I'm not even sure what happened to my left hand.::
21960::$$$message_0196_0052_0000$$$::"...Hgh."[lr]::
21961::$$$message_0196_0052_0001$$$::I can't even breathe.[lr]::
21962::$$$message_0196_0052_0002$$$::A diagonal slash covers my torso, starting at my left shoulder.[lr]::
21963::$$$message_0196_0052_0003$$$::The slash runs all the way through my body, separating parts of me like mismatched building blocks.::
21964::$$$message_0196_0053_0000$$$::I look like a gingko leaf.[lr]::
21965::$$$message_0196_0053_0001$$$::I've been cut open from shoulder to hip.[lr]::
21966::$$$message_0196_0053_0002$$$::It's actually creepy I'm still alive right now.::
21967::$$$message_0196_0054_0000$$$::I don't think this miraculous survival is going to last long.[lr]::
