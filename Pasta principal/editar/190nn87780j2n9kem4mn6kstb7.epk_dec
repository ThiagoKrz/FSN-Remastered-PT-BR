58081::$$$message_0519_0000_0001$$$::No, this is important.[lr]::
58082::$$$message_0519_0000_0002$$$::It's my decision, so I shouldn't push it onto someone else. It's only right that I be the one to tell Sakura.::
58083::$$$message_0519_0001_0000$$$::Just as I make up my mind,[lr]::
58084::$$$message_0519_0001_0001$$$::the doorbell rings with perfect timing.[lr]::
58085::$$$message_0519_0001_0002$$$::"I'm coming in!"[lr]::
58086::$$$message_0519_0001_0003$$$::It's Sakura's voice.[lr]::
58087::$$$message_0519_0001_0004$$$::I'll ask Sakura right away. It's faster this way.::
58088::$$$message_0519_0002_0000$$$::"Ah, Senpai. Thanks for having me over. Are you making dinner now?"[lr]::
58089::$$$message_0519_0002_0001$$$::"Yeah, just starting. I can handle it on my own, so make yourself at home. If you would, could you keep Fuji-nee busy while you're at it? She's being a sore loser after Saber beat her at kendo, so cheer her up with a card game or something."::
58090::$$$message_0519_0003_0000$$$::"That's mean, Senpai. Ms. Fujimura had a rough day, you know."[lr]::
58091::$$$message_0519_0003_0001$$$::"Ahh, she did mention that...then play shogi with her, instead."::
58092::$$$message_0519_0004_0000$$$::"Shogi? Okay, she's very confident at that.[lr]::
58093::$$$message_0519_0004_0001$$$::I think it'll be just right if I give her a handicap and play without rooks."::
58094::$$$message_0519_0005_0000$$$::Sakura's in a good mood.[lr]::
58095::$$$message_0519_0005_0001$$$::The swelling on her face is gone, and there's no sign of the dark bruise from this morning.[lr]::
58096::$$$message_0519_0005_0002$$$::Okay, now would be a good time to bring it up.::
58097::$$$message_0519_0006_0000$$$::"So, Sakura. I know this is sudden, but you should stay over starting tonight."[lr]::
58098::$$$message_0519_0006_0001$$$::"Huh? Stay over...?"[lr]::
58099::$$$message_0519_0006_0002$$$::"You shouldn't go back to the Matou house for the time being. As for how long...let's try to make it a week. Oh, and I already got Fuji-nee's permission."::
58100::$$$message_0519_0007_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
58101::$$$message_0519_0007_0001$$$::Sakura's expression stiffens.[lr]::
58102::$$$message_0519_0007_0002$$$::She gazes back at me like she's scrutinizing my heart rather than my face.::
58103::$$$message_0519_0008_0000$$$::"I know I'm asking a lot. But still, I really want you to stay over. No matter how badly you might think of me, please live here for now."::
58104::$$$message_0519_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58105::$$$message_0519_0009_0001$$$::Sakura doesn't answer.[lr]::
58106::$$$message_0519_0009_0002$$$::She just keeps watching me, and I notice she slightly bites her lip.::
58107::$$$message_0519_0009_0003$$$::"...Why?"[lr]::
58108::$$$message_0519_0009_0004$$$::Finally, she asks me in a very quiet voice.::
58109::$$$message_0519_0010_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
58110::$$$message_0519_0010_0001$$$::I can't give her a reason.[lr]::
58111::$$$message_0519_0010_0002$$$::On my life's honor, I can't tell her it's because Shinji is a Master, but anything else would be a lie.[lr]::
58112::$$$message_0519_0010_0003$$$::Everyone has secrets.[lr]::
58113::$$$message_0519_0010_0004$$$::I'm a guy, so there's plenty of stuff I don't say to Sakura and Fuji-nee.::
58114::$$$message_0519_0011_0000$$$::...No matter how precious someone is to you, there are some things you can't tell them.[lr]::
58115::$$$message_0519_0011_0001$$$::That's all the more reason I can't lie to her.[lr]::
58116::$$$message_0519_0011_0002$$$::If Sakura is my precious family, then I'd rather not tell her anything that's untrue.::
58117::$$$message_0519_0012_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
58118::$$$message_0519_0012_0001$$$::The atmosphere between us chills.[lr]::
58119::$$$message_0519_0012_0002$$$::Silence falls over us, and it seems to stretch on forever. Sakura awkwardly breaks eye contact.[lr]::
58120::$$$message_0519_0012_0003$$$::I desperately rack my stupid brain for a response.::
58121::$$$message_0519_0013_0000$$$::"Do I have to tell you why?"[lr]::
58122::$$$message_0519_0013_0001$$$::She doesn't answer.[lr]::
58123::$$$message_0519_0013_0002$$$::But her eyes seem to show concern for me, rather than herself.[lr]::
58124::$$$message_0519_0013_0003$$$::"...Is it because you're worried about me?"[lr]::
58125::$$$message_0519_0013_0004$$$::She states it outright.::
58126::$$$message_0519_0014_0000$$$::"Yeah. I'm worried, so it would make me feel a lot better if you'd stay over."[lr]::
58127::$$$message_0519_0014_0001$$$::Her long, dark hair sways.[lr]::
58128::$$$message_0519_0014_0002$$$::Sakura nods at my inadequate answer,[lr]::
58129::$$$message_0519_0014_0003$$$::and answers not with words, but a smile.::
