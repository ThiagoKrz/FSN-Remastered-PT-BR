38530::$$$message_0330_0000_0000$$$::She's gone.[lr]::
38531::$$$message_0330_0000_0001$$$::Only Archer and I remain on the temple grounds.::
38532::$$$message_0330_0001_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
38533::$$$message_0330_0001_0001$$$::Seeing him gets on my nerves.[lr]::
38534::$$$message_0330_0001_0002$$$::He's saved me twice today.[lr]::
38535::$$$message_0330_0001_0003$$$::Caster would've taken my Command Spells if it weren't for him, and I'm sure I would've died from that deluge of light.::
38536::$$$message_0330_0002_0000$$$::But this is different.[lr]::
38537::$$$message_0330_0002_0001$$$::I can't forgive him for letting Caster go...::
38538::$$$message_0330_0003_0000$$$::"Archer. Why did you let Caster go?"[lr]::
38539::$$$message_0330_0003_0001$$$::"Because it was not the time to fight. Even if I did attack her, she would have just fled. Don't tell me you didn't see how she can teleport earlier."::
38540::$$$message_0330_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38541::$$$message_0330_0004_0001$$$::...That's...true...[lr]::
38542::$$$message_0330_0004_0002$$$::We wouldn't be able to capture Caster if she really wanted to get away.[lr]::
38543::$$$message_0330_0004_0003$$$::On top of that, this temple is Caster's territory.[lr]::
38544::$$$message_0330_0004_0004$$$::She's a witch.[lr]::
38545::$$$message_0330_0004_0005$$$::Even if she was weakened, I'm sure she had at least one or two tricks up her sleeve.::
38546::$$$message_0330_0005_0000$$$::"Finally get it, huh? If we want to defeat Caster, we need to defeat her Master first. Even if she can teleport away, Caster will eventually disappear if we defeat the Master she is bound to."::
38547::$$$message_0330_0006_0000$$$::...Going for the Master and not the Servant.[lr]::
38548::$$$message_0330_0006_0001$$$::That is the safest and most sure approach in the Holy Grail War.::
38549::$$$message_0330_0007_0000$$$::"...I know that. But still, you're going to let her get away?[lr]::
38550::$$$message_0330_0007_0001$$$::The incidents happening in town are all her doing, right? There will be more victims unless we stop her. I can't let that be."::
38551::$$$message_0330_0008_0000$$$::"Why not? It is not something that harms you. Actually, I would like for her to continue.[lr]::
38552::$$$message_0330_0008_0001$$$::Caster will keep sucking up vitality from people and use that power to defeat Berserker. We can defeat Caster after that.[lr]::
38553::$$$message_0330_0008_0002$$$::Rin and I can defeat Caster, but not Berserker. Until we defeat Berserker, we can let Caster be."::
38554::$$$message_0330_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38555::$$$message_0330_0009_0001$$$::My face heats up.[lr]::
38556::$$$message_0330_0009_0002$$$::Blood rushes to my head, and I want to punch him.::
38557::$$$message_0330_0010_0000$$$::"...Don't be ridiculous. Tohsaka won't do such a thing."::
38558::$$$message_0330_0011_0000$$$::"Right. That's why I want Caster to do so as fast as possible. We can't avoid fighting if Rin finds Caster. It would be ideal if Caster can defeat Berserker before that happens."::
38559::$$$message_0330_0012_0000$$$::"What? I don't know how many people will be sacrificed, but it should be a cheap price to pay if we can defeat Berserker."[lr]::
38560::$$$message_0330_0012_0001$$$::Humans live and humans die. Regardless of what kills them, the result is the same."::
38561::$$$message_0330_0013_0000$$$::"Ugh...!"[lr]::
38562::$$$message_0330_0013_0001$$$::"Though Caster is also resting on her laurels. She should just take their lives, not just their magical energy. If all the humans around die out, it will be a bit easier to fight. My Master is also na√Øve at her core. If that happens, I'm sure she'll do anything to win."::
38563::$$$message_0330_0014_0000$$$::The red knight smiles dryly.[lr]::
38564::$$$message_0330_0014_0001$$$::He sounds amused.[lr]::
38565::$$$message_0330_0014_0002$$$::He feels the people living here are in the way.[lr]::
38566::$$$message_0330_0014_0003$$$::He's saying the same things as Caster...!::
38567::$$$message_0330_0015_0000$$$::"You..."[lr]::
38568::$$$message_0330_0015_0001$$$::"Oh, as you know, Rin is the type to stick to formalities. She's impeccable as a mage, but isn't dirty enough as a Master.[lr]::
38569::$$$message_0330_0015_0002$$$::Yeah, I wouldn't have such a hard time with her if she were more like Caster[line2]"::
38570::$$$message_0330_0016_0000$$$::"You bastard!"[lr]::
38571::$$$message_0330_0016_0001$$$::I punch Archer's face.[lr]::
38572::$$$message_0330_0016_0002$$$::Well, I punch in that general direction, but he easily avoids it.::
38573::$$$message_0330_0017_0000$$$::"What are you doing? I thought we were cooperating."[lr]::
38574::$$$message_0330_0017_0001$$$::"Screw you![lr]::
38575::$$$message_0330_0017_0002$$$::I'm nothing like you. I don't sacrifice those around me in order to win... I would never do such a thing...!"::
38576::$$$message_0330_0018_0000$$$::"I feel the same way, Shirou Emiya. But you cannot save everyone.[lr]::
38577::$$$message_0330_0018_0001$$$::For example, Caster would not just stop at this town if she obtains the Holy Grail. That is the same for Illyasviel and the other Masters.[lr]::
38578::$$$message_0330_0018_0002$$$::As far as I know, you and Rin are the only Masters that would not use the Holy Grail for your own self-interest. There will be more victims unless we win."::
38579::$$$message_0330_0019_0000$$$::"In that case... The only choice is to sacrifice the people here and make use of them."[lr]::
38580::$$$message_0330_0019_0001$$$::We can contain the damage done this way. Like you would want it."::
38581::$$$message_0330_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38582::$$$message_0330_0020_0001$$$::I feel numb.[lr]::
38583::$$$message_0330_0020_0002$$$::He doesn't need to explain it.::
38584::$$$message_0330_0021_0000$$$::I can't save everyone.[lr]::
38585::$$$message_0330_0021_0001$$$::Kiritsugu always said that.[lr]::
38586::$$$message_0330_0021_0002$$$::So I should be over it, but...it's just the [font italic=true]way[font italic=false] that he says it that just pisses me off...!::
38587::$$$message_0330_0022_0000$$$::"You said you don't want to involve any innocent people, right?[lr]::
38588::$$$message_0330_0022_0001$$$::Then accept it. Refusing to kill someone doesn't lead to anyone being saved.[lr]::
38589::$$$message_0330_0022_0002$$$::Just as Caster says, we are unfortunately alike. We would have to cooperate if we do not want any more victims."::
38590::$$$message_0330_0023_0000$$$::"No...! I won't cooperate with you. I can't ever accept you...!"[lr]::
38591::$$$message_0330_0023_0001$$$::"...I see. You only trust Rin, after all."::
38592::$$$message_0330_0024_0000$$$::I turn my back to Archer.[lr]::
38593::$$$message_0330_0024_0001$$$::I'm different than him.[lr]::
38594::$$$message_0330_0024_0002$$$::I can't let Caster be. So there's only one course of action.::
38595::$$$message_0330_0025_0000$$$::"Don't tell me you're going to go after Caster."[lr]::
38596::$$$message_0330_0025_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
38597::$$$message_0330_0025_0002$$$::I ignore him and start walking.[lr]::
38598::$$$message_0330_0025_0003$$$::My destination is inside the temple.[lr]::
38599::$$$message_0330_0025_0004$$$::If this is Caster's territory, then her workshop is inside the temple.::
38600::$$$message_0330_0026_0000$$$::"I can't believe you. You cannot match Caster by yourself. If you want to keep living, turn back."[lr]::
38601::$$$message_0330_0026_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
38602::$$$message_0330_0026_0002$$$::Archer follows, complaining the entire way.::
38603::$$$message_0330_0027_0000$$$::"Damn it all, you're going to waste the life that I saved?[lr]::
38604::$$$message_0330_0027_0001$$$::Have it your way then, but at least thank me before throwing it all away.[lr]::
38605::$$$message_0330_0027_0002$$$::I helped you out of the kindness of my heart. I won't ask you to call me your savior, but you could be thankful towards the fellow you escaped from the brink of death with." ::
38606::$$$message_0330_0028_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
38607::$$$message_0330_0028_0001$$$::Man, he really gets on my nerves...![lr]::
38608::$$$message_0330_0028_0002$$$::"...Shut up! Quit acting like we're pals all of a sudden! Hurry up and go back to Tohsaka's place! I don't need your help!"::
38609::$$$message_0330_0029_0000$$$::I turn away and head towards the temple without looking back for good this time.[lr]::
38610::$$$message_0330_0029_0001$$$::There...[lr]::
38611::$$$message_0330_0029_0002$$$::"...Well then. Good thing you don't like me."[lr]::
38612::$$$message_0330_0029_0003$$$::I feel a chilling premonition of death.::
38613::$$$message_0330_0030_0000$$$::"...What?"[lr]::
38614::$$$message_0330_0030_0001$$$::Before I can fully manage to leap out of the way...[lr]::
38615::$$$message_0330_0030_0002$$$::Archer brings a sword down on me.::
38616::$$$message_0330_0031_0000$$$::"Ah... Guh...!?"[lr]::
38617::$$$message_0330_0031_0001$$$::He cuts me at the shoulder.[lr]::
38618::$$$message_0330_0031_0002$$$::My blood comes pouring out, and I feel like I'll pass out the moment my focus wavers.[lr]::
38619::$$$message_0330_0031_0003$$$::The pain so sharp that I feel like my skin and muscles are burning.::
38620::$$$message_0330_0032_0000$$$::"Haah... Ah..."[lr]::
38621::$$$message_0330_0032_0001$$$::I back away with wobbly steps.[lr]::
38622::$$$message_0330_0032_0002$$$::I can't even flee.[lr]::
38623::$$$message_0330_0032_0003$$$::All my remaining strength is sapped and it's all I can do to remain on my feet.::
38624::$$$message_0330_0033_0000$$$::"Y-you..."[lr]::
38625::$$$message_0330_0033_0001$$$::"Oh, I missed. Must be that I couldn't clamp down on my desire for a kill, or maybe you really do have good reaction time... Well, whatever."[lr]::
38626::$$$message_0330_0033_0002$$$::Archer walks towards me with his sword covered in my blood.::
38627::$$$message_0330_0034_0000$$$::"Ah... Guh...!"[lr]::
38628::$$$message_0330_0034_0001$$$::I'll be killed.[lr]::
38629::$$$message_0330_0034_0002$$$::My instinct is that I'm going to die, and my feet struggle to move.[lr]::
38630::$$$message_0330_0034_0003$$$::   The temple's exit.[lr]::
38631::$$$message_0330_0034_0004$$$::I stagger towards the stairs beyond the mountain gate and retreat back.::
38632::$$$message_0330_0035_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
38633::$$$message_0330_0035_0001$$$::...He must know that this is a fatal wound.[lr]::
38634::$$$message_0330_0035_0002$$$::His steps are unhurried. ::
38635::$$$message_0330_0036_0000$$$::"Haah... Ah, ah...!"[lr]::
38636::$$$message_0330_0036_0001$$$::Everything is going fuzzy.[lr]::
38637::$$$message_0330_0036_0002$$$::I don't know what I'm doing.[lr]::
38638::$$$message_0330_0036_0003$$$::I can't even recall why I'm fleeing or why I was cut to begin with. It feels like my thoughts and memory are following the blood dripping from my body.::
38639::$$$message_0330_0037_0000$$$::...Maybe I'm still conscious because of that sword he's holding.[lr]::
38640::$$$message_0330_0037_0001$$$::The white short sword.[lr]::
38641::$$$message_0330_0037_0002$$$::That plain blade holds my attention and keeps me from closing my eyes.::
38642::$$$message_0330_0038_0000$$$::"Agh...!"[lr]::
38643::$$$message_0330_0038_0001$$$::But it comes to an end.[lr]::
38644::$$$message_0330_0038_0002$$$::The mountain gate is right behind me.[lr]::
38645::$$$message_0330_0038_0003$$$::The stairs are right there, but I can't even turn around.[lr]::
38646::$$$message_0330_0038_0004$$$::The moment I do, I'm sure Archer will split me in two.::
38647::$$$message_0330_0039_0000$$$::"This is it. If you have no reason to fight, die here."[lr]::
38648::$$$message_0330_0039_0001$$$::He raises his blade.[lr]::
38649::$$$message_0330_0039_0002$$$::The white yin sword is raised like a guillotine.::
38650::$$$message_0330_0040_0000$$$::"Wha... Reason...to fight...?"[lr]::
38651::$$$message_0330_0040_0001$$$::"That's right. It's hypocrisy for you to fight for someone else and not yourself. You only wish for peace, not victory.[lr]::
38652::$$$message_0330_0040_0002$$$::Such a thing doesn't even exist in this world."::
38653::$$$message_0330_0041_0000$$$::"I don't..."[lr]::
38654::$$$message_0330_0041_0001$$$::Even as my consciousness fades, I feel defiant.[lr]::
38655::$$$message_0330_0041_0002$$$::But both my body and mind are at their limit.::
38656::$$$message_0330_0042_0000$$$::"...Farewell. Drown in your ideals and die."::
38657::$$$message_0330_0043_0000$$$::His voice is filled with hatred.[lr]::
38658::$$$message_0330_0043_0001$$$::He swings the yin sword Bakuya.[lr]::
38659::$$$message_0330_0043_0002$$$::Once more the blade slashes at me, this time to sever my very life.[lr]::
38660::$$$message_0330_0043_0003$$$::   But right before that...[lr]::
38661::$$$message_0330_0043_0004$$$::With only the thought of defying his words, I jump backwards without thinking of the consequences.::
38662::$$$message_0330_0044_0000$$$::"Guh...!?"[lr]::
38663::$$$message_0330_0044_0001$$$::His sword cuts the air, and my body flies through the air.[lr]::
38664::$$$message_0330_0044_0002$$$::The bottomless darkness is behind me.[lr]::
38665::$$$message_0330_0044_0003$$$::With a horrible sound, my body crashes into the stonework.[lr]::
38666::$$$message_0330_0044_0004$$$::Then it rolls down the mountain stairs.::
38667::$$$message_0330_0045_0000$$$::"Hm, what is that?"[lr]::
38668::$$$message_0330_0045_0001$$$::I hear an unfamiliar voice near me.::
38669::$$$message_0330_0046_0000$$$::"Shirou...!?"[lr]::
38670::$$$message_0330_0046_0001$$$::I also hear a familiar voice.::
38671::$$$message_0330_0047_0000$$$::"...S-Saber...?"[lr]::
38672::$$$message_0330_0047_0001$$$::My vision is almost gone.[lr]::
38673::$$$message_0330_0047_0002$$$::I attempt to lift my body, but can only collapse in a heap back to earth.::
38674::$$$message_0330_0048_0000$$$::"Shirou, please get a hold of yourself...! You're wounded and were pushed down the stairs...!?"[lr]::
38675::$$$message_0330_0048_0001$$$::...Is that Saber?[lr]::
38676::$$$message_0330_0048_0002$$$::Saber supports my body and speaks with urgency.::
38677::$$$message_0330_0049_0000$$$::"Agh... Guh..."[lr]::
38678::$$$message_0330_0049_0001$$$::But that's bad.[lr]::
38679::$$$message_0330_0049_0002$$$::I don't know their identity, but there's one other unknown Servant nearby.[lr]::
38680::$$$message_0330_0049_0003$$$::If she's tending to me, it leaves her wide open for an attack...::
38681::$$$message_0330_0050_0000$$$::"I-it's...fine, Sa...ber..."[lr]::
38682::$$$message_0330_0050_0001$$$::"Be quiet...! There is still time. With your healing powers, if we return home right aw[line2]"[lr]::
38683::$$$message_0330_0050_0002$$$::...She must have realized mid-sentence.[lr]::
38684::$$$message_0330_0050_0003$$$::She looks back at the Servant behind her.::
38685::$$$message_0330_0051_0000$$$::"...Assassin. Why did you not attack me?"[lr]::
38686::$$$message_0330_0051_0001$$$::"That would be tactless. One does not pluck a flower amidst a transient bloom."::
38687::$$$message_0330_0052_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
38688::$$$message_0330_0052_0001$$$::Saber tilts her head, unable to grasp the enemy's true intentions.::
38689::$$$message_0330_0053_0000$$$::"What? I was merely charmed by your countenance. Your expression while in battle was splendid, but your concern now is beautiful. I could not help but admire."[lr]::
38690::$$$message_0330_0053_0001$$$::...Is that a kimono?[lr]::
38691::$$$message_0330_0053_0002$$$::The Servant dressed anachronistically turns his back towards us.::
38692::$$$message_0330_0054_0000$$$::"This is enough for tonight. You should leave, Saber."[lr]::
38693::$$$message_0330_0054_0001$$$::"Wha[line2]Are you letting us go, Assassin?"[lr]::
38694::$$$message_0330_0054_0002$$$::"Yes. If you promise to continue this battle another time, I will let you go.[lr]::
38695::$$$message_0330_0054_0003$$$::I won't be satisfied fighting you in your current situation. It would be a shame."::
38696::$$$message_0330_0055_0000$$$::...Saber glares at Assassin,[lr]::
38697::$$$message_0330_0055_0001$$$::and Assassin stares calmly at Saber.[lr]::
38698::$$$message_0330_0055_0002$$$::Their staredown lasts for a few seconds.::
38699::$$$message_0330_0056_0000$$$::"...I understand, Assassin. I shall settle this match someday."[lr]::
38700::$$$message_0330_0056_0001$$$::"A fine response. I am looking forward to it, King of Knights."[lr]::
38701::$$$message_0330_0056_0002$$$::Saber takes me in her arms and heads down the stairs.[lr]::
38702::$$$message_0330_0056_0003$$$::However...[lr]::
38703::$$$message_0330_0056_0004$$$::I see the knight in red following us from the mountain gate, determined not to let me go.::
38704::$$$message_0330_0057_0000$$$::"Archer...?"[lr]::
38705::$$$message_0330_0057_0001$$$::Saber says in wonder.[lr]::
38706::$$$message_0330_0057_0002$$$::   He said...[lr]::
38707::$$$message_0330_0057_0003$$$::That he kills when he can ensure it.::
38708::$$$message_0330_0058_0000$$$::If he's a man of his word, he can't let me leave here alive.[lr]::
38709::$$$message_0330_0058_0001$$$::If he swung his sword trying to kill me...[lr]::
38710::$$$message_0330_0058_0002$$$::I'm sure he will do whatever he can to kill me now.::
38711::$$$message_0330_0059_0000$$$::The red cloak flutters like a feather.[lr]::
38712::$$$message_0330_0059_0001$$$::It doesn't matter whether Saber is here or not.[lr]::
38713::$$$message_0330_0059_0002$$$::Archer jumps down and slashes his sword at me...!::
38714::$$$message_0330_0060_0000$$$::Swords clash.[lr]::
38715::$$$message_0330_0060_0001$$$::   A counterattack like a flash of light.[lr]::
38716::$$$message_0330_0060_0002$$$::The intercepting blade parries Archer's sword, then makes for his neck as he hangs in midair...!::
38717::$$$message_0330_0060_0003$$$::"Hnng! Assassin, you...!"[lr]::
38718::$$$message_0330_0060_0004$$$::Archer twists his body and lands.[lr]::
38719::$$$message_0330_0060_0005$$$::The knight in red is blocked by the Servant in a kimono and cannot pass down the stairs.::
38720::$$$message_0330_0061_0000$$$::"Do you intend to get in my way, samurai?"[lr]::
38721::$$$message_0330_0061_0001$$$::Archer readies his twin swords and faces the Assassin-class Servant.[lr]::
38722::$$$message_0330_0061_0002$$$::With that in front of him, Assassin adjusts his hold on his sword, as if nothing happened.::
38723::$$$message_0330_0062_0000$$$::"That's my line. Are you trying to get in my way when I have told them I will let them go?"[lr]::
38724::$$$message_0330_0062_0001$$$::His voice is oddly pleasant.[lr]::
38725::$$$message_0330_0062_0002$$$::I don't know what his goal is, but he really intends to let us leave.::
38726::$$$message_0330_0063_0000$$$::"Additionally, my role is to guard this gate. Whether you pass through alive is at my discretion.[lr]::
38727::$$$message_0330_0063_0001$$$::   I let you make your way in, but it is a different story to leave. Your head somewhat lacks elegance, but I shall accept it for tonight."::
38728::$$$message_0330_0063_0002$$$::...He intends to go for the kill.[lr]::
38729::$$$message_0330_0063_0003$$$::Assassin's fighting spirit is as sharp as his longsword.[lr]::
38730::$$$message_0330_0063_0004$$$::There is no dominating presence like Archer or Saber where their everything feels involved.[lr]::
38731::$$$message_0330_0063_0005$$$::His is a sharpened, razor edge that precisely aims for the neck...::
38732::$$$message_0330_0063_0006$$$::"...Well spoken. But a mere tool of Caster that couldn't even scratch Saber is going to match me?"::
38733::$$$message_0330_0064_0000$$$::"I have my complaints as well. I thought you would give that wily old fox an unpleasant surprise, yet you flee with your tail between your legs."[lr]::
38734::$$$message_0330_0064_0001$$$::Their confrontation is short.[lr]::
38735::$$$message_0330_0064_0002$$$::Both parties demonstrate fantastical swordplay.::
38736::$$$message_0330_0065_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38737::$$$message_0330_0065_0001$$$::I'm captivated by what I see.[lr]::
38738::$$$message_0330_0065_0002$$$::To be honest, I can't even make out Assassin's sword technique.[lr]::
38739::$$$message_0330_0065_0003$$$::I'm not unused to swordplay, but I can't make heads or tails out of it. It's too swift and deadly.::
38740::$$$message_0330_0066_0000$$$::The contrast is what makes me so fascinated.[lr]::
38741::$$$message_0330_0066_0001$$$::Dancing twin blades.[lr]::
38742::$$$message_0330_0066_0002$$$::Archer manages to defend himself against such inhuman ability, but his techniques look like something even I could do someday.::
38743::$$$message_0330_0067_0000$$$::I don't like it, but you could say I'm impressed.[lr]::
38744::$$$message_0330_0067_0001$$$::He's fighting against Assassin's magical sword with techniques acquired by experience and sheer force of will rather than talent.::
38745::$$$message_0330_0068_0000$$$::...Damn it, it's obvious that he's strong.[lr]::
38746::$$$message_0330_0068_0001$$$::It's a different strength than Tohsaka or Saber.[lr]::
38747::$$$message_0330_0068_0002$$$::All the training he went through because he's not extraordinary...[lr]::
38748::$$$message_0330_0068_0003$$$::I bet...he didn't have anything.[lr]::
38749::$$$message_0330_0068_0004$$$::So with his limited resources, he trained his heart out and got to that level...::
38750::$$$message_0330_0069_0000$$$::"...Shirou, let us go now. Either way, you must rest your body as soon as possible."[lr]::
38751::$$$message_0330_0069_0001$$$::Saber's voice brings me back to reality.[lr]::
38752::$$$message_0330_0069_0002$$$::We leave Ryudou Temple with Saber carrying me.[lr]::
38753::$$$message_0330_0069_0003$$$::Assassin and Archer's swordplay echoes behind us without pause.::
38754::$$$message_0330_0070_0000$$$::My wound is almost healed by the time we get back.[lr]::
38755::$$$message_0330_0070_0001$$$::"Saber's healing powers might be flowing into you since you're connected with her."[lr]::
38756::$$$message_0330_0070_0002$$$::Tohsaka's opinion might be correct, as my wound heals quickly when Saber's touching me.::
38757::$$$message_0330_0071_0000$$$::"So, what happened, Shirou?"[lr]::
38758::$$$message_0330_0071_0001$$$::Saber demands an explanation once we get to the dojo after treating my wound and getting changed, all without waking Fuji-nee up.::
38759::$$$message_0330_0072_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38760::$$$message_0330_0072_0001$$$::I do my best to summarize all the important points.[lr]::
38761::$$$message_0330_0072_0002$$$::How I was controlled by Caster and went to the temple.[lr]::
38762::$$$message_0330_0072_0003$$$::The coma incidents happening in town and Caster's relation to them.[lr]::
38763::$$$message_0330_0072_0004$$$::...Archer who saved me when my Command Spells were about to be taken.[lr]::
38764::$$$message_0330_0072_0005$$$::And how Archer tried to kill me in the end.::
38765::$$$message_0330_0073_0000$$$::Saber seems to ponder something.[lr]::
38766::$$$message_0330_0073_0001$$$::I would get why she would want to organize her thoughts since all this happened in one night.[lr]::
38767::$$$message_0330_0073_0002$$$::"...I see. So, Archer let Caster go?"::
38768::$$$message_0330_0074_0000$$$::"Yeah, he did... He's the worst. He's no different from Caster if he's using her to win...!"[lr]::
38769::$$$message_0330_0074_0001$$$::It pisses me off when I think back to it.[lr]::
38770::$$$message_0330_0074_0002$$$::Damn it, I wish I'd gotten a hit in on him...!::
38771::$$$message_0330_0075_0000$$$::...Then...[lr]::
38772::$$$message_0330_0075_0001$$$::Saber has a weird expression on her face.::
38773::$$$message_0330_0076_0000$$$::"...Saber. What's so funny?"[lr]::
38774::$$$message_0330_0076_0001$$$::"Well, I was just thinking that it's rare for you to speak ill of someone. Though it has been only a short while, I thought that you were not one to talk behind other people's backs."::
38775::$$$message_0330_0077_0000$$$::"Mrgh..."[lr]::
38776::$$$message_0330_0077_0001$$$::...Now that she mentions it, I have been complaining a lot.::
38777::$$$message_0330_0078_0000$$$::"...But I can't help it. Archer really gets to me. And worst of all, he made fun of Tohsaka, his own partner."::
38778::$$$message_0330_0079_0000$$$::"Yes... But Shirou. Let me ask you one thing.Are you angry at Archer's betrayal?"[lr]::
38779::$$$message_0330_0079_0001$$$::It does not seem that you are angry that he attacked you."::
38780::$$$message_0330_0080_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
38781::$$$message_0330_0080_0001$$$::   Oh, she's right.[lr]::
38782::$$$message_0330_0080_0002$$$::Archer's actions would constitute betrayal.[lr]::
38783::$$$message_0330_0080_0003$$$::...No, but that is...::
38784::$$$message_0330_0081_0000$$$::"...No. It's not like he betrayed me.[lr]::
38785::$$$message_0330_0081_0001$$$::I haven't made any promises with him from the start. That's why even though Archer attacked me, I think that's fair."[lr]::
38786::$$$message_0330_0081_0002$$$::"That is true, but... My, you certainly are a handful."::
38787::$$$message_0330_0082_0000$$$::But her tone has a certain fondness to it.::
38788::$$$message_0330_0083_0000$$$::"In conclusion, I feel the same as you. I cannot let Caster be, but Archer is not cruel."[lr]::
38789::$$$message_0330_0083_0001$$$::"Huh...? Hold on, what part were you listening to, Saber?"::
38790::$$$message_0330_0084_0000$$$::"Everything. Based on all that I have heard, I am saying I have the same opinion as you.[lr]::
38791::$$$message_0330_0084_0001$$$::And his sword technique is like a clear stream. He must have nothing evil in his heart. I believe that his dance-like swordplay indicates his character."::
38792::$$$message_0330_0085_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
38793::$$$message_0330_0085_0001$$$::I don't like it even more now.[lr]::
38794::$$$message_0330_0085_0002$$$::Something is wrong with Saber to compliment him.[lr]::
38795::$$$message_0330_0085_0003$$$::First of all, Archer's technique is...::
38796::$$$message_0330_0086_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
38797::$$$message_0330_0086_0001$$$::No, I was just being delusional![lr]::
38798::$$$message_0330_0086_0002$$$::He's like yogurt that's about to expire compared to Saber!::
38799::$$$message_0330_0087_0000$$$::"Hmph. What are you saying? His technique is nothing. He couldn't even kill me with a surprise attack. How can he call himself a Servant?"[lr]::
38800::$$$message_0330_0087_0001$$$::"Yes. That is because you have talent as well. You should be able to reach Archer's skill level if you train long enough."::
38801::$$$message_0330_0088_0000$$$::"Khh..."[lr]::
38802::$$$message_0330_0088_0001$$$::I can't object if she says so while making that face.[lr]::
38803::$$$message_0330_0088_0002$$$::...Anyhow, Saber approves of Archer's technique.[lr]::
38804::$$$message_0330_0088_0003$$$::I don't know why, but I can't stand that fact.::
38805::$$$message_0330_0089_0000$$$::"...Saber. You said I have talent, right?"[lr]::
38806::$$$message_0330_0089_0001$$$::"Yes. If you continue to work at it, your skill will improve greatly."::
38807::$$$message_0330_0090_0000$$$::"...I've decided. Then, can you teach me things once my wound heals?[lr]::
38808::$$$message_0330_0090_0001$$$::Not just how to survive, but I want to learn how to fight."[lr]::
38809::$$$message_0330_0090_0002$$$::I shake Saber's hand and look her directly in the eyes.::
38810::$$$message_0330_0091_0000$$$::"Hm? Ah, certainly. I don't mind if you so desire."::
38811::$$$message_0330_0092_0000$$$::All right, I have no complaints if I can study under Saber.[lr]::
38812::$$$message_0330_0092_0001$$$::I can't repeat the same failure as tonight, and it's not like me to keep on running away.::
38813::$$$message_0330_0093_0000$$$::...Most importantly...[lr]::
38814::$$$message_0330_0093_0001$$$::I can't lose to the guy who said we need more victims in order to reduce the total number of victims...:G’⁄
