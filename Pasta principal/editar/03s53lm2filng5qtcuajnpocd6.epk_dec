59693::$$$message_0543_0000_0000$$$::"Yeah, I agree with your take on it.[lr]::
59694::$$$message_0543_0000_0001$$$::I can't let that Shadow run around. I don't know the mage behind it, but they've got nerve running amok on my land."::
59695::$$$message_0543_0001_0000$$$::"Are we going to keep the truce, then?"[lr]::
59696::$$$message_0543_0001_0001$$$::"Of course. We don't have the luxury of fighting until we eliminate that Shadow."::
59697::$$$message_0543_0002_0000$$$::   The conversation wraps up smoothly.[lr]::
59698::$$$message_0543_0002_0001$$$::When lunch break started, I went to Tohsaka's Class A and brought her to the roof.[lr]::
59699::$$$message_0543_0002_0002$$$::Then, I kicked things off by suggesting that we do something about the Shadow, but Tohsaka turned out to be even more determined than I am.::
59700::$$$message_0543_0003_0000$$$::"So, what's the plan? Should we patrol together tonight, or split up and search?"::
59701::$$$message_0543_0004_0000$$$::"Let me think...I think we should split up roles.[lr]::
59702::$$$message_0543_0004_0001$$$::You keep patrolling at night. I want you to go over any place you find suspicious as a mage or that stands out to Saber with a fine-toothed comb.[lr]::
59703::$$$message_0543_0004_0002$$$::While you do that out in the open, I'm going to go after Zouken."::
59704::$$$message_0543_0005_0000$$$::"...Zouken Matou? What does he have to do with the Shadow?"::
59705::$$$message_0543_0006_0000$$$::"No idea. I think he's a weak lead because he's scared of it too, but something about him bothers me.[lr]::
59706::$$$message_0543_0006_0001$$$::...Plus, we still can't ignore him even without the Shadow. He's been doing all kinds of shady stuff like controlling Caster's corpse or turning Shinji into a Master even though he isn't even a mage."::
59707::$$$message_0543_0007_0000$$$::"Oh. Yeah, now that you mention it, we teamed up to deal with Caster for similar reasons. We can't just let the old man run wild now."::
59708::$$$message_0543_0008_0000$$$::"Yeah. We'll deal with the Shadow once we clean up the mess around it. Even if you find it, just observe from a distance. We shouldn't fight it until we can do that on our own terms."::
59709::$$$message_0543_0009_0000$$$::"OK. So what are you going to do, specifically? Do you know where Zouken is?"::
59710::$$$message_0543_0010_0000$$$::"Huh...? Um, yeah. I don't know exactly where he is now, but I can go straight to the Matou estate. Our families are connected, so I'm better for this job than you anyway."[lr]::
59711::$$$message_0543_0010_0001$$$::Tohsaka lays out her plan in a lighthearted tone.[lr]::
59712::$$$message_0543_0010_0002$$$::The details are anything but light, though.::
59713::$$$message_0543_0011_0000$$$::"You'll go to the Matous' place!? That's dropping straight into the enemy's home base, you know!"[lr]::
59714::$$$message_0543_0011_0001$$$::"I know that. What are you so shocked for? I'm not going to fight. I'm just going to scout out their camp."::
59715::$$$message_0543_0012_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]And what are you gonna do if Zouken ambushes you!?[lr]::
59716::$$$message_0543_0012_0001$$$::I'm not letting you go there by yourself. I'm coming too, so don't be reckless[line2]"::
59717::$$$message_0543_0013_0000$$$::"You're the reckless one, stupid.[lr]::
59718::$$$message_0543_0013_0001$$$::I said that I have a connection to the Matous, remember? I know their magecraft and I figured out how strong Zouken is yesterday. To be clear, Zouken isn't much of an enemy.[lr]::
59719::$$$message_0543_0013_0002$$$::He uses most of his magical energy just to maintain his body, and he has no direct means of attack."::
59720::$$$message_0543_0014_0000$$$::"In fact, if Zouken wants a straight up fight, it would be to my advantage. Without Shinji as a Master, he's hardly a threat.[lr]::
59721::$$$message_0543_0014_0001$$$::Leave the old-fashioned mage duels to me. You should go physically gather intel for us."::
59722::$$$message_0543_0015_0000$$$::"...Mrgh."[lr]::
59723::$$$message_0543_0015_0001$$$::I can't argue with her when she puts it like that.[lr]::
59724::$$$message_0543_0015_0002$$$::Tohsaka has Archer with her, so there's no point being overprotective.::
59725::$$$message_0543_0016_0000$$$::"...All right. I'll let you deal with Zouken. Saber and I will look for the Shadow."[lr]::
59726::$$$message_0543_0016_0001$$$::"Okay, thanks... Also, Emiya, I wanted to ask. Sakura's really staying at your place, right?"::
59727::$$$message_0543_0017_0000$$$::"? Yeah, she's been sleeping over. Why?"[lr]::
59728::$$$message_0543_0017_0001$$$::"No, never mind. I'm relieved to hear it.[lr]::
59729::$$$message_0543_0017_0002$$$::It would get awkward if I ran into her at the Matou house. She doesn't know anything."::
59730::$$$message_0543_0018_0000$$$::"Oh, right... You're really considerate, Tohsaka. I'm surprised."[lr]::
59731::$$$message_0543_0018_0001$$$::"S-stop looking at me like it's a huge shocker. What do you take me for?"::
59732::$$$message_0543_0019_0000$$$::"Well, if you have to ask..."[lr]::
59733::$$$message_0543_0019_0001$$$::A human hurricane who arrives with a crash and leaves with a bang, I guess.::
59734::$$$message_0543_0020_0000$$$::"...Hmph. I don't care what you think.[lr]::
59735::$$$message_0543_0020_0001$$$::Anyway, I'll deal with the Matou problem, so just behave the rest of the day."::
59736::$$$message_0543_0021_0000$$$::"Roger that. I'll use the daytime to train with Saber, in the meantime."[lr]::
59737::$$$message_0543_0021_0001$$$::I stand up and head for the exit.[lr]::
59738::$$$message_0543_0021_0002$$$::Lunchtime is almost over, so I'd better get back to class.::
59739::$$$message_0543_0022_0000$$$::"Later, Tohsaka. Let's meet up here tomorrow."[lr]::
59740::$$$message_0543_0022_0001$$$::"Okay. We'll tell each other what we found out.[lr]::
59741::$$$message_0543_0022_0002$$$::Oh, but Emiya?"[lr]::
59742::$$$message_0543_0022_0003$$$::Tohsaka's lips curl into a smile.::
59743::$$$message_0543_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59744::$$$message_0543_0023_0001$$$::...When she smiles like that, it never means anything good.::
59745::$$$message_0543_0024_0000$$$::I make a beeline for the door, a terrible feeling building in my stomach.[lr]::
59746::$$$message_0543_0024_0001$$$::"Maybe you shouldn't spend all your time training.[lr]::
59747::$$$message_0543_0024_0002$$$::Isn't there something else you could be doing?[lr]::
59748::$$$message_0543_0024_0003$$$::Liiiike, taking better care of the girl living under the same roof?"[lr]::
59749::$$$message_0543_0024_0004$$$::Unfortunately, I was still within her attack range.::
59750::$$$message_0543_0025_0000$$$::"W-what the hell are you talking about!?[lr]::
59751::$$$message_0543_0025_0001$$$::S-Sakura and I aren't like that! I'm just keeping an eye on her while Shinji is acting out[line2]"::
59752::$$$message_0543_0026_0000$$$::"Oh, I was only saying that you should let Saber rest. Wow, Emiya. So Sakura comes to mind first when I mention girls, huh?"[lr]::
59753::$$$message_0543_0026_0001$$$::She smirks.::
59754::$$$message_0543_0027_0000$$$::"Ah. Er. Uh..."[lr]::
59755::$$$message_0543_0027_0001$$$::My face is beet red.::
59756::$$$message_0543_0028_0000$$$::"Just kidding, man. Did you like that bit of payback?"[lr]::
59757::$$$message_0543_0028_0001$$$::"...Only a nutcase would like the way you treat me."::
59758::$$$message_0543_0029_0000$$$::My shoulders droop.[lr]::
59759::$$$message_0543_0029_0001$$$::I feel as slack as a marionette with its strings cut.::
59760::$$$message_0543_0030_0000$$$::"So that's your weakness, Emiya. I guess that joke was in bad taste."[lr]::
59761::$$$message_0543_0030_0001$$$::"Hmph! You're the one with bad taste! I'm leaving."::
59762::$$$message_0543_0031_0000$$$::"Sure, go on ahead. I'm going to stay here and laugh at you a little longer."[lr]::
59763::$$$message_0543_0031_0001$$$::"Nngh! Damn it, see you tomorrow, Tohsaka!"[wsay canskip=1]::
59764::$$$message_0543_0032_0000$$$::I slam the door behind me and leave the roof.[lr]::
59765::$$$message_0543_0032_0001$$$::...Damn it.[lr]::
59766::$$$message_0543_0032_0002$$$::She only came here to push my buttons.::
59767::$$$message_0543_0033_0000$$$::Did I like it?[lr]::
59768::$$$message_0543_0033_0001$$$::What does that even mean?[lr]::
59769::$$$message_0543_0033_0002$$$::In the first place, I don't remember doing anything to her to warrant this treatment!:: ð
