32235::$$$message_0260_0000_0000$$$::...I can't be a burden to Saber.[lr]::
32236::$$$message_0260_0000_0001$$$::Even if I go after Berserker, it's not like I can do anything. But I'm sure Saber can manage on her own.[lr]::
32237::$$$message_0260_0000_0002$$$::Saber risked her life to draw Berserker away.[lr]::
32238::$$$message_0260_0000_0003$$$::If all that was done to protect me, there's no reason for me to stay here, where it is so dangerous.::
32239::$$$message_0260_0001_0000$$$::"Haah... Haah... Haah..."[lr]::
32240::$$$message_0260_0001_0001$$$::I hurry across the bridge from Shinto and run home.[lr]::
32241::$$$message_0260_0001_0002$$$::I never once look back.[lr]::
32242::$$$message_0260_0001_0003$$$::Whether out of fear of a nonexistent pursuer or guilt over leaving Saber behind, I'm not sure.[lr]::
32243::$$$message_0260_0001_0004$$$::Either way, I run for my life, my eyes fixed on the road ahead of me.::
32244::$$$message_0260_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32245::$$$message_0260_0002_0001$$$::...The living room is just as I left it.[lr]::
32246::$$$message_0260_0002_0002$$$::The air has remained still since Lancer's attack and Tohsaka coming over.[lr]::
32247::$$$message_0260_0002_0003$$$::I go over to the repaired window.[lr]::
32248::$$$message_0260_0002_0004$$$::I find two small pieces of glass on the floor. Tohsaka must have missed them.::
32249::$$$message_0260_0003_0000$$$::"...There's no crack in the window... I wonder how she made up for the missing pieces."[lr]::
32250::$$$message_0260_0003_0001$$$::I mutter to myself.[lr]::
32251::$$$message_0260_0003_0002$$$::...For some reason, I don't feel like turning on the light.[lr]::
32252::$$$message_0260_0003_0003$$$::I hide in the darkness as if to conceal my weakness.::
32253::$$$message_0260_0004_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
32254::$$$message_0260_0004_0001$$$::What I should be thinking about...[lr]::
32255::$$$message_0260_0004_0002$$$::What I should be saying... I'm running away from these things.[lr]::
32256::$$$message_0260_0004_0003$$$::...The person who was here in this room until a few hours ago.[lr]::
32257::$$$message_0260_0004_0004$$$::The person who was beside me until a few minutes ago.[lr]::
32258::$$$message_0260_0004_0005$$$::I should be asking myself whether it was right to leave those two behind, but I can't seem to do anything but hide in this darkness.::
32259::$$$message_0260_0005_0000$$$::The clock strikes 3 AM.[lr]::
32260::$$$message_0260_0005_0001$$$::...It's been 30 minutes since then.[lr]::
32261::$$$message_0260_0005_0002$$$::Whatever the outcome, the battle's probably over by now.::
32262::$$$message_0260_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32263::$$$message_0260_0006_0001$$$::I should go back.[lr]::
32264::$$$message_0260_0006_0002$$$::I pull myself together and look up to turn on the light...[lr]::
32265::$$$message_0260_0006_0003$$$::Suddenly, a sharp pain sears the back of my left hand, then disappears.::
32266::$$$message_0260_0007_0000$$$::"...The Command Spell is getting lighter...?"[lr]::
32267::$$$message_0260_0007_0001$$$::The color has faded from the Command Spell.[lr]::
32268::$$$message_0260_0007_0002$$$::The shape remains, but the bright red that proves I am Saber's Master has disappeared.[lr]::
32269::$$$message_0260_0007_0003$$$::I know, instinctively, what that means.[lr]::
32270::$$$message_0260_0007_0004$$$::"No, Saber...!"[lr]::
32271::$$$message_0260_0007_0005$$$::I follow my instincts and run out of the darkness where I've been hiding.::
32272::$$$message_0260_0008_0000$$$::I run outside.[lr]::
32273::$$$message_0260_0008_0001$$$::I know I'm too late.[lr]::
32274::$$$message_0260_0008_0002$$$::Even so, I run as fast as I can back to where I left Saber...[lr]::
32275::$$$message_0260_0008_0003$$$::Something I can't see lashes from ahead and impales my heart.::
32276::$$$message_0260_0009_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
32277::$$$message_0260_0009_0001$$$::...I can't hear too well.[lr]::
32278::$$$message_0260_0009_0002$$$::There's something in front of me. Something's protruding from my chest. I just...can't make out what.::
32279::$$$message_0260_0010_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
32280::$$$message_0260_0010_0001$$$::The...something in front of me sneers and tells me I'm an idiot.[lr]::
32281::$$$message_0260_0010_0002$$$::It's laughing at me and saying there's no reason for me to be alive after I lost my Servant.::
32282::$$$message_0260_0011_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
32283::$$$message_0260_0011_0001$$$::That's right...[lr]::
32284::$$$message_0260_0011_0002$$$::Shirou Emiya dies the moment that he loses Saber.[lr]::
32285::$$$message_0260_0011_0003$$$::Without Saber, I have no means of protecting myself. I can't possibly survive.::
32286::$$$message_0260_0012_0000$$$::I'm all alone now. I hadn't realized it, but I am.[lr]::
32287::$$$message_0260_0012_0001$$$::And this is where that's brought me.[lr]::
32288::$$$message_0260_0012_0002$$$::This would have happened the same whether I was at home, or wherever I might have tried to run.::
32289::$$$message_0260_0013_0000$$$::"Hrrk..."[lr]::
32290::$$$message_0260_0013_0001$$$::My consciousness fades away...[lr]::
32291::$$$message_0260_0013_0002$$$::I don't know who it is, and I don't care whether that thing piercing my heart is a spear or an arrow.[lr]::
32292::$$$message_0260_0013_0003$$$::It doesn't matter whether I die here and now or tomorrow.::
32293::$$$message_0260_0014_0000$$$::Because...[lr]::
32294::$$$message_0260_0014_0001$$$::...now that my Command Spell has faded, my life is essentially over.::H
