55077::$$$message_0487_0000_0001$$$::My legs move, and my arms still work.[lr]::
55078::$$$message_0487_0000_0002$$$::I just need to move up and pull Tohsaka back...::
55079::$$$message_0487_0001_0000$$$::"Tohsaka!"[lr]::
55080::$$$message_0487_0001_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
55081::$$$message_0487_0001_0002$$$::Tohsaka doesn't even twitch when I grab her arm.[lr]::
55082::$$$message_0487_0001_0003$$$::She's heavier than she looks.::
55083::$$$message_0487_0002_0000$$$::"Ngh. Damn, you're heavy!"[lr]::
55084::$$$message_0487_0002_0001$$$::I can't budge her even with two hands.[lr]::
55085::$$$message_0487_0002_0002$$$::So all I can do...[lr]::
55086::$$$message_0487_0002_0003$$$::"Come on, just get back!"[lr]::
55087::$$$message_0487_0002_0004$$$::...is shoulder tackle her out of the way!::
55088::$$$message_0487_0003_0000$$$::"Ow."[lr]::
55089::$$$message_0487_0003_0001$$$::I hear a dull impact.::
55090::$$$message_0487_0004_0000$$$::"You[line2]what the heck you are you doing!?"[lr]::
55091::$$$message_0487_0004_0001$$$::"Toh..."[lr]::
55092::$$$message_0487_0004_0002$$$::I can't hear Tohsaka's voice.::
55093::$$$message_0487_0005_0000$$$::...My body is hot.[lr]::
55094::$$$message_0487_0005_0001$$$::My vision gets all soft and twisty, like I've caught a serious fever.::
55095::$$$message_0487_0005_0002$$$::"Senpai?"::
55096::$$$message_0487_0005_0003$$$::...I think I hear a familiar voice, far away.[lr]::
55097::$$$message_0487_0005_0004$$$::I'm losing my grip on reality.[lr]::
55098::$$$message_0487_0005_0005$$$::In my white, hazy mind, the blood coming from my left arm mixes like paint on a canvas.::
55099::$$$message_0487_0005_0006$$$::"No..."::
55100::$$$message_0487_0005_0007$$$::With her hands clenched at her chest, Sakura stares in shock at me on the ground.::
55101::$$$message_0487_0005_0008$$$::"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"::
55102::$$$message_0487_0005_0009$$$::I see her fall like a puppet with its strings cut.::
55103::$$$message_0487_0005_0010$$$::"How are you feeling? Have you calmed down?"[lr]::
55104::$$$message_0487_0005_0011$$$::"..."[lr]::
55105::$$$message_0487_0005_0012$$$::Sitting on one of the church pews, I nod wordlessly.::
55106::$$$message_0487_0006_0000$$$::"Okay. Then you don't need healing. You'll recover along with your physical stamina, so try to rest for now."::
55107::$$$message_0487_0007_0000$$$::Tohsaka takes a seat a slight distance from me.[lr]::
55108::$$$message_0487_0007_0001$$$::...But our emotional distance is many times wider.[lr]::
55109::$$$message_0487_0007_0002$$$::We're just waiting in the chapel for Kotomine, not making small talk.::
55110::$$$message_0487_0008_0000$$$::"Ngh."[lr]::
55111::$$$message_0487_0008_0001$$$::When I try to clench my left hand, it twitches numbly.[lr]::
55112::$$$message_0487_0008_0002$$$::The pain feels like a nail was driven through my palm.[lr]::
55113::$$$message_0487_0008_0003$$$::My left hand hurt more from gripping the knife than the dull pain of Rider's beating or Sakura stabbing me through the left arm.::
55114::$$$message_0487_0009_0000$$$::Dark clouds obscure the night sky.[lr]::
55115::$$$message_0487_0009_0001$$$::They seem like rain clouds announcing an imminent shower.::
55116::$$$message_0487_0010_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
55117::$$$message_0487_0010_0001$$$::...The spear-like thing that attacked Tohsaka was apparently Sakura's magecraft.::
55118::$$$message_0487_0011_0000$$$::The Matous pass down Absorption magecraft through their family.[lr]::
55119::$$$message_0487_0011_0001$$$::Sakura unconsciously unleashed her magecraft because she was suffering from magical energy deficiency.[lr]::
55120::$$$message_0487_0011_0002$$$::She targeted Tohsaka because she had the most magical energy there.[lr]::
55121::$$$message_0487_0011_0003$$$::When I pushed Tohsaka out of the way and that thing touched me, it caught my left arm and drained me dry of my power.::
55122::$$$message_0487_0012_0000$$$::Magical energy is life energy.[lr]::
55123::$$$message_0487_0012_0001$$$::It stands to reason that one would collapse if it was taken away.[lr]::
55124::$$$message_0487_0012_0002$$$::Already exhausted from fighting Rider, I fainted right away, and then Tohsaka brought us to the chruch.[lr]::
55125::$$$message_0487_0012_0003$$$::...She says that Sakura lost consciousness at the same time I did.::
55126::$$$message_0487_0013_0000$$$::"...She attacked herself."[lr]::
55127::$$$message_0487_0013_0001$$$::Tohsaka murmurs, explaining that Sakura is being treated in the back of the church.:Ëø}
