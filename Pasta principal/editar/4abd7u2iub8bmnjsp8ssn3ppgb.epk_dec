59191::$$$message_0535_0000_0000$$$::...Zouken Matou stands there, looking just as he did the night before.[lr]::
59192::$$$message_0535_0000_0001$$$::He looks completely intact, even after Archer cut him in two.[lr]::
59193::$$$message_0535_0000_0002$$$::The old mage, waiting only for death to claim him, laughs, as if the other night's events were all a dream.::
59194::$$$message_0535_0001_0000$$$::His methods are a mystery, but if he's truly recovered, then they must be in the realm of restoration, not just healing.[lr]::
59195::$$$message_0535_0001_0001$$$::You can't accomplish this by just healing a wound.[lr]::
59196::$$$message_0535_0001_0002$$$::It's grand magecraft which returns a lost body from nothing to its original form.[lr]::
59197::$$$message_0535_0001_0003$$$::So...does that mean he's immortal?::
59198::$$$message_0535_0002_0000$$$::"What do you expect to accomplish by swinging a stick, boy?"[lr]::
59199::$$$message_0535_0002_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59200::$$$message_0535_0002_0002$$$::I face down Zouken with a Strengthened kyousaku stick.::
59201::$$$message_0535_0003_0000$$$::I can't get any closer to him, nor can I run away to join Saber.[lr]::
59202::$$$message_0535_0003_0001$$$::...If Zouken is immortal, then there's nothing I can do against him with a stick.::
59203::$$$message_0535_0004_0000$$$::"Will you attack me, or go after your Servant? Either way, nothing will happen until you move your feet."[lr]::
59204::$$$message_0535_0004_0001$$$::Insects squirm and chitter all around the old mage.[lr]::
59205::$$$message_0535_0004_0002$$$::No, not just around him.[lr]::
59206::$$$message_0535_0004_0003$$$::I can see the shadows moving, blocking out the moonlight.::
59207::$$$message_0535_0005_0000$$$::"Bugs."[lr]::
59208::$$$message_0535_0005_0001$$$::I know what they are, even if I can't see them.[lr]::
59209::$$$message_0535_0005_0002$$$::The darkness is a disgusting horde of insects.[lr]::
59210::$$$message_0535_0005_0003$$$::Darker than black, they fill all four corners of the shrine room, covering every wall.[lr]::
59211::$$$message_0535_0005_0004$$$::The room is completely overrun by the bugs teeming over the walls, and the stench of rotten meat.::
59212::$$$message_0535_0006_0000$$$::"Why do you hesitate? You were the ones who disemboweled me the other day. Didn't you join forces with the Tohsaka girl to defeat me?"::
59213::$$$message_0535_0007_0000$$$::...The insect-wielding Zouken is clearly enjoying this.[lr]::
59214::$$$message_0535_0007_0001$$$::Obviously, I can't do a damn thing about the swarms of insects with a stick.[lr]::
59215::$$$message_0535_0007_0002$$$::Zouken only needs to give the order to drown me in a sea of bugs.::
59216::$$$message_0535_0008_0000$$$::   No, maybe...[lr]::
59217::$$$message_0535_0008_0001$$$::If I run outside as fast as I can, I might be able to break out of this desperate situation.[lr]::
59218::$$$message_0535_0008_0002$$$::There's a lot of them, but they're just bugs.[lr]::
59219::$$$message_0535_0008_0003$$$::I doubt they can take out a whole human in a matter of seconds.::
59220::$$$message_0535_0009_0000$$$::"Whatever you do, I can wait.[lr]::
59221::$$$message_0535_0009_0001$$$::Will you believe in Saber and wait for her return? Kill me with that weapon? Or break past my worms and run outside! The choice is yours."::
59222::$$$message_0535_0010_0000$$$::...Hmph.[lr]::
59223::$$$message_0535_0010_0001$$$::It sounds like he doesn't intend to let me get away.[lr]::
59224::$$$message_0535_0010_0002$$$::The longer we drag out this staring match, the more bugs gather.[lr]::
59225::$$$message_0535_0010_0003$$$::Then, I'll...[lr]::
