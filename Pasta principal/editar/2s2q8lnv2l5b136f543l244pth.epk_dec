57373::$$$message_0511_0000_0000$$$::    I'd better run away.[lr]::
57374::$$$message_0511_0000_0001$$$::I mean, I'd better hurry to class.[lr]::
57375::$$$message_0511_0000_0002$$$::Asking Tohsaka for advice seemed like a good idea,::
57376::$$$message_0511_0001_0000$$$::but the school's number-one student gives off the aura of a cat ready to tear apart any mice that stray too close.[lr]::
57377::$$$message_0511_0001_0001$$$::A wise man keeps away from danger, after all.::
57378::$$$message_0511_0002_0000$$$::"Morning, Tohsaka. Later, Tohsaka."[lr]::
57379::$$$message_0511_0002_0001$$$::I sprint up the stairs as fast as I can.::
57380::$$$message_0511_0003_0000$$$::"H-hold it, I'm still talking to you!"[lr]::
57381::$$$message_0511_0003_0001$$$::I run for the hallway, turning to look back at the devil's voice behind me.[lr]::
57382::$$$message_0511_0003_0002$$$::...She looks like she's still gathering steam, but nothing could be more dangerous than talking to Tohsaka right now, so this was the right call.::
57383::$$$message_0511_0004_0000$$$::I made it.[lr]::
57384::$$$message_0511_0004_0001$$$::It's still three minutes before homeroom starts, and Fuji-nee isn't here yet.::
57385::$$$message_0511_0005_0000$$$::Shinji's desk is empty.[lr]::
57386::$$$message_0511_0005_0001$$$::It's gonna be tough to face him after yesterday, but I was hoping to talk to him.[lr]::
57387::$$$message_0511_0005_0002$$$::If he's absent, though, there's nothing I can do about that.[lr]::
57388::$$$message_0511_0005_0003$$$::Going to the Matou house would just provoke him, so I need to think of another way that won't involve Sakura.::
57389::$$$message_0511_0006_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
57390::$$$message_0511_0006_0001$$$::There's another empty seat: [lr]::
57391::$$$message_0511_0006_0002$$$::Issei's.[lr]::
57392::$$$message_0511_0006_0003$$$::"Wow. Never thought I'd see that guy miss class."[lr]::
57393::$$$message_0511_0006_0004$$$::I put my bag down at my desk and get ready for homeroom.::
57394::$$$message_0511_0007_0000$$$::"Thanks for waiting! How do you like my new record?"[lr]::
57395::$$$message_0511_0007_0001$$$::Fuji-nee arrives before the bell, which is unusual for her.[lr]::
57396::$$$message_0511_0007_0002$$$::...I'm a little relieved.[lr]::
57397::$$$message_0511_0007_0003$$$::I thought maybe she overslept since she didn't come over for breakfast, but she's as chipper as ever.::
57398::$$$message_0511_0008_0000$$$::"It's chow time! Let's go get the good stuff at the cafeteria before they're out!"[lr]::
57399::$$$message_0511_0008_0001$$$::The moment lunch break starts, a boisterous roar goes up from the middle of the classroom.[lr]::
57400::$$$message_0511_0008_0002$$$::Only the boys are ever involved in a ruckus like this, while the girls avoid them and move their desks into fours.::
57401::$$$message_0511_0009_0000$$$::"Ahh, I'll buy lunch today, too. I'm coming with you, Saitama."[r][wsay canskip=1]::
57402::$$$message_0511_0009_0001$$$::"I'll pass. We had that yesterday."[r][wsay canskip=1]::
57403::$$$message_0511_0009_0002$$$::"We're staying, too. ...Don't you boys ever get tired of that stuff? We're sick of the school lunches."::
57404::$$$message_0511_0010_0000$$$::"Whaaat!? Set B is the best, though! They call it a croquette combo but all you can taste is meat!"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
57405::$$$message_0511_0010_0001$$$::"Yeah, but not everyone thinks that makes it a good deal. I'll be honest with you man, when I eat vegetables, I don't really want them to taste like meat."::
57406::$$$message_0511_0011_0000$$$::"What about you, Emiya? Why don't you switch sides from the home lunch to the cafeteria team?  Actually, just make me lunch, would ya?"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
57407::$$$message_0511_0011_0001$$$::"Hey, no fair! Emiya, why don't you come eat with us? You can trade for one of our sandwiches!"::
57408::$$$message_0511_0012_0000$$$::"Oh please, you bought that at a convenience store! You can't even be bothered to cook, what kind of girl are you!? We're not giving you our lunch! If you want some fine dining, then come back once you've learned to fry an egg!"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
57409::$$$message_0511_0012_0001$$$::"RUDE! I know how to make it! You just need to heat them up in hot water.  So, how about it, Emiya?"::
57410::$$$message_0511_0013_0000$$$::"...Uh, that's not how you make it.[lr]::
57411::$$$message_0511_0013_0001$$$::Everything you guys said was just wrong. Anyway, I didn't bring lunch today. I haven't had time lately, and I'll probably be eating school lunch until the end of the term."::
57412::$$$message_0511_0014_0000$$$::"WHAAAAT!?"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
57413::$$$message_0511_0014_0001$$$::Both Team Cafeteria and Team Takeout's jaws drop.[lr]::
57414::$$$message_0511_0014_0002$$$::It's always times like this when the bitter rivals of our class suddenly become bosom buddies.::
57415::$$$message_0511_0015_0000$$$::I have the combo meal that some of my classmates went on about. The fried shrimp tastes like red meat for some reason, and I grumble about it as I go back to my classroom.::
57416::$$$message_0511_0016_0000$$$::It's almost fifth period. I sit down and start getting ready for the next class, when...[lr]::
57417::$$$message_0511_0016_0001$$$::"What's...this?"[lr]::
57418::$$$message_0511_0016_0002$$$::I find a slip of paper in my desk.::
57419::$$$message_0511_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57420::$$$message_0511_0017_0001$$$::...I don't know what to say.[lr]::
57421::$$$message_0511_0017_0002$$$::The note was written using a ruler grid for character spacing, perhaps to obscure the writer's handwriting.::
57422::$$$message_0511_0018_0000$$$::"Tohsaka."[lr]::
57423::$$$message_0511_0018_0001$$$::...It is her, right?[lr]::
57424::$$$message_0511_0018_0002$$$::After this morning, I can't imagine it would be anyone else.[lr]::
57425::$$$message_0511_0018_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
57426::$$$message_0511_0018_0004$$$::Frankly, I'd like to pretend I never saw this threatening note, but the last sentence is particularly concerning.::
57427::$$$message_0511_0019_0000$$$::"Did she plan this so that I can still read the part she scribbled out...? No way, right?"[lr]::
57428::$$$message_0511_0019_0001$$$::...I don't feel like responding, but I could use Tohsaka's advice.[lr]::
57429::$$$message_0511_0019_0002$$$::I still haven't figured out what to do with Sakura, so I'll keep my expectations low and go talk with Tohsaka.::
57430::$$$message_0511_0020_0000$$$::The school day ends after sixth period.[lr]::
57431::$$$message_0511_0020_0001$$$::It's time.[lr]::
57432::$$$message_0511_0020_0002$$$::I don't know what Tohsaka's scheming, but there are still students on campus.[lr]::
57433::$$$message_0511_0020_0003$$$::The kyudo club should be practicing until 5:00 PM, so I could run somewhere there's still a lot of people around, if it comes to that.[lr]::
57434::$$$message_0511_0020_0004$$$::Tohsaka's a respectable mage, so she shouldn't attack me while there are witnesses around.::
57435::$$$message_0511_0021_0000$$$::Miyama is, as its name suggests, a neighborhood built in a mountain pass.[lr]::
57436::$$$message_0511_0021_0001$$$::It's a hilly area, and there are paths that cross the smaller hills.::
57437::$$$message_0511_0022_0000$$$::Our school is located on one of those hills.[lr]::
57438::$$$message_0511_0022_0001$$$::The campus was erected on a mountainside, and the area behind it is, of course, undeveloped.[lr]::
57439::$$$message_0511_0022_0002$$$::Meaning that if you go behind the school, you'll immediately enter a wooded thicket.::
57440::$$$message_0511_0023_0000$$$::   Then...[lr]::
57441::$$$message_0511_0023_0001$$$::In the deepening woods, where not even the adventurous athletics club dares to tread,[lr]::
57442::$$$message_0511_0023_0002$$$::beyond the shadowy monoliths, I find a monstrous archdemon lying in wait.::
57443::$$$message_0511_0024_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
57444::$$$message_0511_0024_0001$$$::To be honest, I already want to go home.[lr]::
57445::$$$message_0511_0024_0002$$$::But she'll definitely come after me if I leave now.[lr]::
57446::$$$message_0511_0024_0003$$$::Without a doubt, a merciless rain of fire will descend upon my helpless back.::
57447::$$$message_0511_0025_0000$$$::"Uh, Tohsaka? I'm here. What do you want?"[lr]::
57448::$$$message_0511_0025_0001$$$::I call out from the edge of the tree line.[lr]::
57449::$$$message_0511_0025_0002$$$::By no means should I step into the area where she is.[lr]::
57450::$$$message_0511_0025_0003$$$::I'm sure that the closer I get, the lower my chances of survival will be.::
57451::$$$message_0511_0026_0000$$$::"Hey, Tohsaka! Can you hear me!?"[lr]::
57452::$$$message_0511_0026_0001$$$::I raise my voice.[lr]::
57453::$$$message_0511_0026_0002$$$::"...ear me...me...me..." it echoes.::
57454::$$$message_0511_0027_0000$$$::"I hear you! Stop standing there::
57455::$$$message_0511_0027_0001$$$:: and [font italic=true]yelling my name over and over![font italic=false]"[lr]::
57456::$$$message_0511_0027_0002$$$::"...ver...ver...ver..."[lr]::
57457::$$$message_0511_0027_0003$$$::She's pissed at me for getting even this close.[lr]::
57458::$$$message_0511_0027_0004$$$::Her voice echoed twice as loud.::
57459::$$$message_0511_0028_0000$$$::"Damn, Tohsaka. I think they could hear that all the way at the archery range."[lr]::
57460::$$$message_0511_0028_0001$$$::"Ah. Crap. You almost had me going again."[lr]::
57461::$$$message_0511_0028_0002$$$::Tohsaka clicks her tongue and walks backward.::
57462::$$$message_0511_0029_0000$$$::"Hmph. Fine. I expected this much. I figured you'd come here acting like the hapless amateur you are."[lr]::
57463::$$$message_0511_0029_0001$$$::And...[lr]::
57464::$$$message_0511_0029_0002$$$::I gotta wonder what crawled up her butt and died to put her in even a worse mood than before.::
57465::$$$message_0511_0030_0000$$$::"...? What are you so upset about? Did I embarrass you that much by yelling?"[lr]::
57466::$$$message_0511_0030_0001$$$::"I-I'm not mad about that, you dork![lr]::
57467::$$$message_0511_0030_0002$$$::I'm mad at how you can be as daring as a crook while simultaneously being so naïve it hurts!"::
57468::$$$message_0511_0031_0000$$$::She glares at me.[lr]::
57469::$$$message_0511_0031_0001$$$::You know, others would be thrilled to be alone with Tohsaka like this, but the circumstances keep pulling me back to reality.::
57470::$$$message_0511_0032_0000$$$::"What are you getting at? Am I some sort of wolf in sheep's clothing to you?"[lr]::
57471::$$$message_0511_0032_0001$$$::"Hardly. In your case, you really are a sheep, except you're some mutant freak that turns the tables on the wolf."::
57472::$$$message_0511_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]Huh?[font italic=false][lr]::
57473::$$$message_0511_0033_0001$$$::I understand even less than I did a moment ago.[lr]::
57474::$$$message_0511_0033_0002$$$::Also, that "mutant freak" doesn't sound like a sheep at all.::
57475::$$$message_0511_0034_0000$$$::"Fine, whatever. I don't have time for chitchat, so let's get to business. Nice of you not to flee, by the way."[lr]::
57476::$$$message_0511_0034_0001$$$::"Yeah, uh, I couldn't just ignore that awful threat you sent me. I bet it's got some curse on it."::
57477::$$$message_0511_0035_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
57478::$$$message_0511_0035_0001$$$::She pauses for a moment.[lr]::
57479::$$$message_0511_0035_0002$$$::Bewilderment is evident in her expression.::
57480::$$$message_0511_0036_0000$$$::"Wait. What threat?"[lr]::
57481::$$$message_0511_0036_0001$$$::"This."[lr]::
57482::$$$message_0511_0036_0002$$$::I show her the piece of paper I found in my desk.::
57483::$$$message_0511_0037_0000$$$::"Oh, don't scare me like that. Who else besides me would invite you out here?"::
57484::$$$message_0511_0038_0000$$$::"You're such a basket case. Yeah, I'm annoyed with you, but I wouldn't curse a simple message. It was a completely ordinary letter[line2][lr]::
57485::$$$message_0511_0038_0001$$$::...Wait, why are you looking at me like that?"::
57486::$$$message_0511_0039_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
57487::$$$message_0511_0039_0001$$$::I mean, who wouldn't?[lr]::
57488::$$$message_0511_0039_0002$$$::Tohsaka actually thinks that was just a message.[lr]::
57489::$$$message_0511_0039_0003$$$::I mean, I wouldn't have problem if that was just her personal aesthetic. But the image of Rin Tohsaka in my mind is in complete tatters now.::
57490::$$$message_0511_0040_0000$$$::"Oof... Did I...maybe...unconsciously put a Gandr on it?"[lr]::
57491::$$$message_0511_0040_0001$$$::"Huh? No, there was nothing wrong with the physical letter. But anyone would read it as a threat. If someone other than me had seen it, they'd report it to a teacher."::
57492::$$$message_0511_0041_0000$$$::"W-well, what did you expect? There wasn't time, it's not like I'd write something formal to you, so I just wrote exactly what I needed."::
57493::$$$message_0511_0042_0000$$$::"Still, you didn't need to use a ruler. Also, I could feel the intensity in that last sentence."::
57494::$$$message_0511_0043_0000$$$::"That's your fault, Emiya.[lr]::
57495::$$$message_0511_0043_0001$$$::You got away from me this morning, so I thought that was the only way to catch you. I put a little more oomph into the end, hoping you'd take the hint."::
57496::$$$message_0511_0044_0000$$$::"Oh, whatever, call it a threat, a confession, or even a calling card. It served its purpose, and I'm happy with that."::
57497::$$$message_0511_0045_0000$$$::Tohsaka coolly turns her back on me.[lr]::
57498::$$$message_0511_0045_0001$$$::...Though, I'm glad she's aware that she wrote that note a little scarily.::
57499::$$$message_0511_0046_0000$$$::"Okay. So what did you want, anyway? Don't tell me you called me all the way out here because you wanted another fight."::
57500::$$$message_0511_0047_0000$$$::"If you want. But don't get the wrong idea. I haven't attacked you because Archer is still recovering, but if he had been ready to go, I would've taken your Command Spells from you this morning.[lr]::
57501::$$$message_0511_0047_0001$$$::I warned you so many times not to do anything reckless, but seeing you walk around in broad daylight like this makes me wish I'd gone for it."::
57502::$$$message_0511_0048_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57503::$$$message_0511_0048_0001$$$::My eyes widen.[lr]::
57504::$$$message_0511_0048_0002$$$::So, Tohsaka's angry because...[lr]::
57505::$$$message_0511_0048_0003$$$::"Tohsaka, you were worried about me?"[lr]::
57506::$$$message_0511_0048_0004$$$::I'm not sure why, but that's what this was all about?::
57507::$$$message_0511_0049_0000$$$::"O-of course not! I called you out here because I was curious about what happened this morning.[lr]::
57508::$$$message_0511_0049_0001$$$::So, Emiya, weren't you trying to tell me something? I'm in the mood to listen, so go ahead."::
57509::$$$message_0511_0050_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57510::$$$message_0511_0050_0001$$$::I'm even more shocked.[lr]::
57511::$$$message_0511_0050_0002$$$::What's gotten into her? I didn't expect Tohsaka to seek me out just to let me ask her questions.::
57512::$$$message_0511_0051_0000$$$::"And now the silent treatment, hmm? That's fine too, you don't have to talk to me if you can't tell me. I'm not mad anymore, so I'll just go home."::
57513::$$$message_0511_0052_0000$$$::"Ah[line2]wait, Tohsaka.[lr]::
57514::$$$message_0511_0052_0001$$$::I have something to talk about. Actually, I've been wanting to ask you for advice."[lr]::
57515::$$$message_0511_0052_0002$$$::"Then spit it out. I'll keep your secrets, and I'll help you if I can."::
57516::$$$message_0511_0053_0000$$$::"Thanks.[lr]::
57517::$$$message_0511_0053_0001$$$::...Um, this doesn't have anything to do with you, but there's this girl named Sakura Matou.[lr]::
57518::$$$message_0511_0053_0002$$$::She's a first-year I've known for a while, and I go back a long way with her big brother Shinji Matou, too.[lr]::
57519::$$$message_0511_0053_0003$$$::So, to make a long story short, I fought Shinji last night. He was a Master."::
57520::$$$message_0511_0054_0000$$$::"Shinji Matou was...a Master...?"[lr]::
57521::$$$message_0511_0054_0001$$$::"Yeah. His grandpa Zouken told me, so I'm sure of that. He said that the Matou family has always been mages. Did you know that, Tohsaka?"::
57522::$$$message_0511_0055_0000$$$::"...Of course. You're the only mage in town that I didn't know about. But that can't be right. Shinji[line2]"::
57523::$$$message_0511_0056_0000$$$::"Isn't a mage. He lacks even the bare minimum Magic Circuits to be a spellcaster. Zouken said that, too.[lr]::
57524::$$$message_0511_0056_0001$$$::But, that only means he can't be a mage.[lr]::
57525::$$$message_0511_0056_0002$$$::I think the conditions to be a Master are different. I'm not that different from Shinji. We shouldn't assume that someone can't become a Master just because they aren't a mage."::
57526::$$$message_0511_0057_0000$$$::"...I see. So, did you beat Shinji?"[lr]::
57527::$$$message_0511_0057_0001$$$::"Yeah. Saber beat his Servant, Rider. His Command Spell book burned up, and he isn't a Master anymore.[lr]::
57528::$$$message_0511_0057_0002$$$::...But I don't think he's given up yet. Sakura lives at his house, even though things are really dangerous right now."::
57529::$$$message_0511_0058_0000$$$::"Zouken told me that only the chosen heir can inherit the family magecraft. Sakura was raised without knowing anything about that. So she doesn't know what Shinji's been up to.[lr]::
57530::$$$message_0511_0058_0001$$$::If that stays true, then Sakura should be able to live her life without ever getting involved in the Masters' battles."::
57531::$$$message_0511_0059_0000$$$::"...That's right. So what makes you think Sakura's in danger?"[lr]::
57532::$$$message_0511_0059_0001$$$::"I told you, Shinji is unstable. Sakura lives with him, so there's no guarantee she won't get mixed up in this.[lr]::
57533::$$$message_0511_0059_0002$$$::That's why, um..."::
57534::$$$message_0511_0060_0000$$$::"You want to settle this before she does. You're right to think that, but it's impossible for you. There's the matter of Ryudou Temple, and I have a bad feeling about the other Masters. This war is going to drag on longer than I thought."[lr]::
57535::$$$message_0511_0060_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
57536::$$$message_0511_0061_0000$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
57537::$$$message_0511_0061_0001$$$::Shinji forfeiting as a Master and exiting the war would be the best outcome, but it isn't realistic to hope for that.[lr]::
57538::$$$message_0511_0061_0002$$$::The next best option would be to separate Sakura from Shinji, but...::
57539::$$$message_0511_0062_0000$$$::"So there's only one thing left to do. If you don't want this Sakura girl to get involved, then you can just take her under your protection."[lr]::
57540::$$$message_0511_0062_0001$$$::"I thought about that. But I'm a Master, too.[lr]::
57541::$$$message_0511_0062_0002$$$::She's in danger at my house, and Shinji won't like it. Sakura's sure to be upset at me if I suddenly tell her to move in, too."::
57542::$$$message_0511_0063_0000$$$::"...Whew. You sure are oblivious, Emiya."[lr]::
57543::$$$message_0511_0063_0001$$$::"Huh?"::
57544::$$$message_0511_0064_0000$$$::"Nothing. You may as well ask her. Protecting Sakura from Shinji is the same as protecting her from the other Masters.[lr]::
57545::$$$message_0511_0064_0001$$$::That just means you should pick a solution that you can do yourself, right? ...If this Sakura is so important to you, that is."::
57546::$$$message_0511_0065_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57547::$$$message_0511_0065_0001$$$::Tohsaka's words strike a chord, somehow.[lr]::
57548::$$$message_0511_0065_0002$$$::It's like getting punched in the head.[lr]::
57549::$$$message_0511_0065_0003$$$::"You're...right. Yeah, that makes sense. I should just ask Sakura herself instead of worrying about how she might feel."[lr]::
57550::$$$message_0511_0065_0004$$$::"..."::
57551::$$$message_0511_0066_0000$$$::"Thanks, Tohsaka. I'll try to convince her as soon as I get home... So now you're giving me the silent treatment?"::
57552::$$$message_0511_0067_0000$$$::"No. I just didn't think I did anything worth thanking.[lr]::
57553::$$$message_0511_0067_0001$$$::More importantly, now I owe you. I didn't think I'd learn from you that Shinji was a Master.[lr]::
57554::$$$message_0511_0067_0002$$$::In exchange, I'd better show you my cards."::
57555::$$$message_0511_0068_0000$$$::"Huh? Your cards?"[lr]::
57556::$$$message_0511_0068_0001$$$::"I'm saying I'll trade you information. Finding out that Shinji was a Master clears things up for me, so I'll give you some new intel.[lr]::
57557::$$$message_0511_0068_0002$$$::You've heard about the sudden unexplained comas happening around town, right?[lr]::
57558::$$$message_0511_0068_0003$$$::That's the work of a Servant, and its Master is in Ryudou Temple."::
57559::$$$message_0511_0069_0000$$$::"Eh!? So that's why you mentioned it earlier. You mean [font italic=true]that[font italic=false] Ryudou Temple, in the mountains!?"::
57560::$$$message_0511_0070_0000$$$::"Yeah. They're tricky, so be careful if you go after them. Even if they haven't killed anyone yet, they've been indiscriminately attacking people.[lr]::
57561::$$$message_0511_0070_0001$$$::I'd like to crush them soon since they're getting stronger by the day, but my Archer's still healing from a wound from [font italic=true]somebody[font italic=false].[lr]::
57562::$$$message_0511_0070_0002$$$::Well, no matter how much energy they've saved up, there's only so much they can do with it, so I'll just sit back and wait for now."::
57563::$$$message_0511_0071_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57564::$$$message_0511_0071_0001$$$::...So there's a Master in Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
57565::$$$message_0511_0071_0002$$$::Tohsaka must be doing everything she can to stay in the fight without Archer.::
57566::$$$message_0511_0072_0000$$$::"That's all I have for you.[lr]::
57567::$$$message_0511_0072_0001$$$::Goodbye for now, Emiya. You'd better get home soon and reassure your adorable junior."::
57568::$$$message_0511_0073_0000$$$::"Huh? Tohsaka, hey!"[lr]::
57569::$$$message_0511_0073_0001$$$::I try to stop her, but Tohsaka ignores me and leaves in the direction of the archery range.::
57570::$$$message_0511_0074_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
57571::$$$message_0511_0074_0001$$$::I wonder why...[lr]::
57572::$$$message_0511_0074_0002$$$::Tohsaka was in a foul mood from start to finish, but her initial irritation seemed somehow different from grumpiness at the end.::
57573::$$$message_0511_0075_0000$$$::"Oh, it's school closing hours. I'd better get home."[lr]::
57574::$$$message_0511_0075_0001$$$::The bell tolls 5:00 PM.[lr]::
57575::$$$message_0511_0075_0002$$$::The sun will set soon.[lr]::
57576::$$$message_0511_0075_0003$$$::I have to speak to Sakura, so I should go home soon.::
