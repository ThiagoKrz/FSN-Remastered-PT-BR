60058::$$$message_0547_0000_0000$$$::She dashes down the corridor, chasing the skull mask.[lr]::
60059::$$$message_0547_0000_0001$$$::The distance between them closes from 18 meters to a mere five.[lr]::
60060::$$$message_0547_0000_0002$$$::Saber is close enough to cleave her enemy in two with a single step.::
60061::$$$message_0547_0001_0000$$$::But the enemy knows that, too.[lr]::
60062::$$$message_0547_0001_0001$$$::If she closes in, he throws daggers to prevent her from finishing the fight, and if she doesn't close in, that gives him a chance to retreat.::
60063::$$$message_0547_0002_0000$$$::The skull doesn't sprint with galelike speed the way Saber does, but retreats with bestial agility.[lr]::
60064::$$$message_0547_0002_0001$$$::He slips through the narrow corridors with ease, navigating tight turns without losing speed.[lr]::
60065::$$$message_0547_0002_0002$$$::Does he have eyes in the back of his head, or is his back the mask he turns towards Saber when he faces her down?[lr]::
60066::$$$message_0547_0002_0003$$$::Assassin, the skull-masked Servant, evades Saber's pursuit, keeping her neither too close nor too far, like a road mirage.::
60067::$$$message_0547_0003_0000$$$::    Sparks fly.[lr]::
60068::$$$message_0547_0003_0001$$$::Three daggers are hurled without any movement telegraphing their flight. Yet, they fail to touch Saber.::
60069::$$$message_0547_0004_0000$$$::Saber has some resistance to projectile attacks, just as Lancer did.[lr]::
60070::$$$message_0547_0004_0001$$$::Compared to Lancer who predicts their trajectories using air current sounds and his opponent's hostile intent,[lr]::
60071::$$$message_0547_0004_0002$$$::Saber predicts the attacks using air current sounds and her Intuition.[lr]::
60072::$$$message_0547_0004_0003$$$::Invisible attacks are not particularly threatening to Heroic Spirits.[lr]::
60073::$$$message_0547_0004_0004$$$::They operate on a level beyond that, killing each other with decisive attacks that may be understood, but not prevented.::
60074::$$$message_0547_0005_0000$$$::To continue the example, Lancer's spear is worthy to be a Heroic Spirit's Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
60075::$$$message_0547_0005_0001$$$::It is a weapon that pierces the heart without fail. Even if its identity is known, it cannot be blocked.[lr]::
60076::$$$message_0547_0005_0002$$$::The only ways to defend against that demonic spear would be: [lr]::
60077::$$$message_0547_0005_0003$$$::to erect a brute barrier with magical energy exceeding that of the spear,[lr]::
60078::$$$message_0547_0005_0004$$$::to possess luck so auspicious that it bends the destiny-fixing effect of the spear,[lr]::
60079::$$$message_0547_0005_0005$$$::or to prevent Lancer from using the spear to begin with.::
60080::$$$message_0547_0006_0000$$$::Compared to that, Assassin's dirks are easily managed.[lr]::
60081::$$$message_0547_0006_0001$$$::They are lethal if they strike a vital point, but the fact that they can be simply blocked makes them little different than pebbles.::
60082::$$$message_0547_0007_0000$$$::"Tch."[lr]::
60083::$$$message_0547_0007_0001$$$::Assassin has thrown more than forty dirks.[lr]::
60084::$$$message_0547_0007_0002$$$::The robed killer finally stops, his ammunition exhausted.::
60085::$$$message_0547_0008_0000$$$::"Mrgh."[lr]::
60086::$$$message_0547_0008_0001$$$::His pursuer skids to a halt as well.[lr]::
60087::$$$message_0547_0008_0002$$$::Her enemy, who had kept her at a distance, has suddenly stopped.[lr]::
60088::$$$message_0547_0008_0003$$$::She can feel the sinister aura plainly emanating from Assassin.[lr]::
60089::$$$message_0547_0008_0004$$$::This is no time for a foolhardy charge.::
60090::$$$message_0547_0009_0000$$$::"Do you accept your fate, Assassin?"[lr]::
60091::$$$message_0547_0009_0001$$$::Saber takes a slight step back, despite knowing that the best tactical choice would be to cut him down here.[lr]::
60092::$$$message_0547_0009_0002$$$::I must not advance any further.[lr]::
60093::$$$message_0547_0009_0003$$$::Her Intuition, which kept her alive for so many years,[lr]::
60094::$$$message_0547_0009_0004$$$::broadcasts a warning with maximum urgency.[lr]::
60095::$$$message_0547_0009_0005$$$::Do not advance.[lr]::
60096::$$$message_0547_0009_0006$$$::Do not approach the gloom.::
60097::$$$message_0547_0010_0000$$$::"Indeed I have, Saber. I am out of ammunition.[lr]::
60098::$$$message_0547_0010_0001$$$::And I am prepared to die to a single stroke of your sword, but why do you not approach?"::
60099::$$$message_0547_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60100::$$$message_0547_0011_0001$$$::Saber does not answer, but she slightly raises the tip of her sword.[lr]::
60101::$$$message_0547_0011_0002$$$::It points at her enemy.[lr]::
60102::$$$message_0547_0011_0003$$$::Seven meters separate them now. It would take her two steps to reach him.[lr]::
60103::$$$message_0547_0011_0004$$$::It is a range that requires a swordsman like Saber to advance.[lr]::
60104::$$$message_0547_0011_0005$$$::Furthermore, she has a hidden weapon she can use only once,[lr]::
60105::$$$message_0547_0011_0006$$$::for which range is not even a consideration.::
60106::$$$message_0547_0012_0000$$$::Assassin's black cloak flutters.[lr]::
60107::$$$message_0547_0012_0001$$$::He does not know where the breeze stirring it is coming from.::
60108::$$$message_0547_0013_0000$$$::"Hmph. Nothing to say to me? Suit yourself. I'll speak as I please."[lr]::
60109::$$$message_0547_0013_0001$$$::The clarity of Assassin's voice belies his appearance.[lr]::
60110::$$$message_0547_0013_0002$$$::It resembles someone...the spearman she fought before, perhaps. Saber narrows her eyes.::
60111::$$$message_0547_0014_0000$$$::"But I am impressed you fended them all off. I aimed them so that they would not be seen, but you saw them nonetheless."[lr]::
60112::$$$message_0547_0014_0001$$$::"I didn't see them directly, but I can read their trajectories. I could not wield this blade if I feared the unseen."::
60113::$$$message_0547_0015_0000$$$::The skull chuckles in agreement.[lr]::
60114::$$$message_0547_0015_0001$$$::What use is throwing black-painted daggers at someone who wields an invisible sword?[lr]::
60115::$$$message_0547_0015_0002$$$::Assassin keeps laughing, appreciating the clear difference in the two Heroic Spirits' calibers and the gap in their Noble Phantasms' capabilities.::
60116::$$$message_0547_0016_0000$$$::"So I was never a threat to begin with.[lr]::
60117::$$$message_0547_0016_0001$$$::In the end, I am a mere Assassin who cannot stand toe-to-toe with an upstanding Heroic Spirit. We lurk in the shadows. No Heroic Spirit exists to be chosen for such a role."[lr]::
60118::$$$message_0547_0016_0002$$$::"What?"::
60119::$$$message_0547_0017_0000$$$::"Thus, all we can do is assassinate. We Assassins are failed imitations of Heroic Spirits who are only able to kill mortal Masters, not Servants.[lr]::
60120::$$$message_0547_0017_0001$$$::   Thus, I only have one target.[lr]::
60121::$$$message_0547_0017_0002$$$::Do you understand now, Saber? Everything I've done has been for the sake of killing your Master."::
60122::$$$message_0547_0018_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
60123::$$$message_0547_0018_0001$$$::"The very same. My lord is entertaining yours.[lr]::
60124::$$$message_0547_0018_0002$$$::In drawing me away from him, you've left him to become worm food unless you hurry back soon."[lr]::
60125::$$$message_0547_0018_0003$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
60126::$$$message_0547_0018_0004$$$::Saber's sword flashes into brilliance.[lr]::
60127::$$$message_0547_0018_0005$$$::Or rather, she reveals the golden radiance that it always had.::
60128::$$$message_0547_0019_0000$$$::"Ah-ha! So you used a wind charm to conceal the blade. I see now. That gale force could strike me even from there. You don't need to risk yourself by closing in."[lr]::
60129::$$$message_0547_0019_0001$$$::The black cloak sinks down.[lr]::
60130::$$$message_0547_0019_0002$$$::It turns out that the prey he lured out has a ranged weapon of its own.[lr]::
60131::$$$message_0547_0019_0003$$$::No stratagem or calculation can help him now.[lr]::
60132::$$$message_0547_0019_0004$$$::If Saber means to cut him from afar, then all Assassin can do is attempt to disrupt her up close.::
60133::$$$message_0547_0020_0000$$$::"Our positions are reversed, Assassin. Will you meet this Barrier of the Wind King?"[lr]::
60134::$$$message_0547_0020_0001$$$::"Wicked woman, inviting me to jump into a horde of locusts. And yet, the dragon is about to unleash its breath. What a dilemma..."::
60135::$$$message_0547_0021_0000$$$::The skull mask reaches the ground.[lr]::
60136::$$$message_0547_0021_0001$$$::Crouching low, he resembles a crawling spider.[lr]::
60137::$$$message_0547_0021_0002$$$::The vacuum vortex of compressed air is about to be unleashed on Assassin.[lr]::
60138::$$$message_0547_0021_0003$$$::It would be insane to face it.[lr]::
60139::$$$message_0547_0021_0004$$$::Does he really expect to endure that lethal tempest by curling up on the ground?::
60140::$$$message_0547_0022_0000$$$::"Clearly, this will be our final exchange. Allow me to say something first, Saber.[lr]::
60141::$$$message_0547_0022_0001$$$::   You claimed that you could beat me in a duel."[lr]::
60142::$$$message_0547_0022_0002$$$::Saber raises her sword.[lr]::
60143::$$$message_0547_0022_0003$$$::She won't let him stall for an escape with words.[lr]::
60144::$$$message_0547_0022_0004$$$::Her eyes are locked on to Assassin.[lr]::
60145::$$$message_0547_0022_0005$$$::Even if he attempts spatial teleportation, she can finish him before he moves.::
60146::$$$message_0547_0023_0000$$$::"That is why you separated me from him. It was the right decision to protect your Master."[lr]::
60147::$$$message_0547_0023_0001$$$::She's raised her sword as high as it will go.[lr]::
60148::$$$message_0547_0023_0002$$$::Now, all she has to do is let it fall. Assassin sinks even lower to the floor.::
60149::$$$message_0547_0024_0000$$$::"But, how will you protect yourself, I wonder?"[lr]::
60150::$$$message_0547_0024_0001$$$::He asks a question.[lr]::
60151::$$$message_0547_0024_0002$$$::To that,[lr]::
60152::$$$message_0547_0024_0003$$$::"I must go. Goodbye, Assassin."[lr]::
60153::$$$message_0547_0024_0004$$$::Saber answers with her sword.::
60154::$$$message_0547_0025_0000$$$::The duel is decided.[lr]::
60155::$$$message_0547_0025_0001$$$::Like a divine dragon, the vortex of air swallows corridor and skull both, snaking through the temple in a violent tumult.::
60156::$$$message_0547_0026_0000$$$::There is no blocking or dodging it.[lr]::
60157::$$$message_0547_0026_0001$$$::As with Lancer's spear, the only way to stop Saber's Invisible Air is by overcoming it with sheer magical energy.[lr]::
60158::$$$message_0547_0026_0002$$$::Assassin's magical energy can't even compare to Saber's.[lr]::
60159::$$$message_0547_0026_0003$$$::The only way he could have stopped the attack is by stopping Saber from unleashing it.::
60160::$$$message_0547_0027_0000$$$::But it's too late to stop the released tempest.[lr]::
60161::$$$message_0547_0027_0001$$$::The black cloak is sure to be cut into ribbons within a second of her sword stroke.[lr]::
60162::$$$message_0547_0027_0002$$$::A vortex of death descends on him.[lr]::
60163::$$$message_0547_0027_0003$$$::But in the midst of that vacuum wave...[lr]::
60164::$$$message_0547_0027_0004$$$::"God is great!"[lr]::
60165::$$$message_0547_0027_0005$$$::Assassin cries out an exultant laugh, and charges.::
60166::$$$message_0547_0028_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
60167::$$$message_0547_0028_0001$$$::An attack aimed at her neck.[lr]::
60168::$$$message_0547_0028_0002$$$::As Saber instantly parries it, the black cloak slips over her head and drops behind her.::
60169::$$$message_0547_0029_0000$$$::"Damn you!"[lr]::
60170::$$$message_0547_0029_0001$$$::With godlike speed, Saber spins to attack him.[lr]::
60171::$$$message_0547_0029_0002$$$::But Assassin is no longer there, having leapt out of range.::
60172::$$$message_0547_0030_0000$$$::At the same time...[lr]::
60173::$$$message_0547_0030_0001$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
60174::$$$message_0547_0030_0002$$$::The ominous presence she's been feeling now covers the ground beneath her feet.::
60175::$$$message_0547_0031_0000$$$::"It seems you're unlucky on two fronts, Saber."[lr]::
60176::$$$message_0547_0031_0001$$$::The shadow spreads.[lr]::
60177::$$$message_0547_0031_0002$$$::Its muddy corruption taints her silver armor.::
60178::$$$message_0547_0032_0000$$$::"The first is a matter of compatibility. Those who traverse the desert always call upon a djinn's charm to ward off the wind. It is the only magecraft I know how to invoke."[lr]::
60179::$$$message_0547_0032_0001$$$::The corridor is plunged into darkness.[lr]::
60180::$$$message_0547_0032_0002$$$::Pale moonlight fails to illuminate the shadows.[lr]::
60181::$$$message_0547_0032_0003$$$::As her consciousness fades,[lr]::
60182::$$$message_0547_0032_0004$$$::she sees it.::
60183::$$$message_0547_0033_0000$$$::"Assass...in...you..."[lr]::
60184::$$$message_0547_0033_0001$$$::"That's right, Saber. Your second misfortune was choosing to fight here. You should have noticed what vile creature was lurking here."::
60185::$$$message_0547_0034_0000$$$::"Ngh...argh..."[lr]::
60186::$$$message_0547_0034_0001$$$::She can't even hear Assassin's voice.[lr]::
60187::$$$message_0547_0034_0002$$$::In a few more seconds, she will disappear.[lr]::
60188::$$$message_0547_0034_0003$$$::This Shadow consumes Servants.[lr]::
60189::$$$message_0547_0034_0004$$$::Her body screams in revulsion, even as her thoughts fade.::
60190::$$$message_0547_0035_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
60191::$$$message_0547_0035_0001$$$::It doesn't matter if it's a futile gesture.[lr]::
60192::$$$message_0547_0035_0002$$$::She'll spend every last drop of magical energy, if that's what it takes to break out of this bind.::
60193::$$$message_0547_0036_0000$$$::   The Shadow still only covers her feet.[lr]::
60194::$$$message_0547_0036_0001$$$::If she fights against it at maximum output, she can break free.[lr]::
60195::$$$message_0547_0036_0002$$$::Even if she loses most of her energy and the part of her taken by the Shadow, at least she can escape.::
60196::$$$message_0547_0037_0000$$$::And yet...[lr]::
60197::$$$message_0547_0037_0001$$$::"Now, that won't do. You will disappear here, Saber."[lr]::
60198::$$$message_0547_0037_0002$$$::The Shadow isn't her only foe.[lr]::
60199::$$$message_0547_0037_0003$$$::The skull had been watching this effort play out like a spectator, but he is still a grim reaper here to bring death.::
60200::$$$message_0547_0038_0000$$$::"You...planned...this..."[lr]::
60201::$$$message_0547_0038_0001$$$::"You said you would win in a duel. That's certainly true. But you are alone, while I have two on my side. All I had to do was make you lower your guard."[lr]::
60202::$$$message_0547_0038_0002$$$::The Shadow encroaches further.::
60203::$$$message_0547_0039_0000$$$::"Nngh...! Argh, agh..."[lr]::
60204::$$$message_0547_0039_0001$$$::Her very existence begins to decay, starting with her feet.[lr]::
60205::$$$message_0547_0039_0002$$$::She's lost sensation from her toes to her thighs.[lr]::
60206::$$$message_0547_0039_0003$$$::Her legs becoming both part of this world, and not part of it.::
60207::$$$message_0547_0040_0000$$$::"A Servant cannot resist that [font italic=true]alyal[font italic=false]. That's doubly true for a proper Heroic Spirit like you. Even a relatively similar being like me will have its magical energy robbed with a touch. For one as pure as you, its mere touch is enough to lose your sanity.[lr]::
60208::$$$message_0547_0040_0001$$$::...Still, it would be a waste to have you disappear. I would fail to fulfill my goal. I will have your heart."::
60209::$$$message_0547_0041_0000$$$::"And how...will you do that?"[lr]::
60210::$$$message_0547_0041_0001$$$::"Is that so strange? Do you think I have no way to kill you, just because I am out of daggers and cannot approach the Shadow?"::
60211::$$$message_0547_0042_0000$$$::Murderous intent emanates from the skull.[lr]::
60212::$$$message_0547_0042_0001$$$::Assassin's magical energy, which felt feeble so far, concentrates in his right arm.::
60213::$$$message_0547_0043_0000$$$::His right arm is a club,[lr]::
60214::$$$message_0547_0043_0001$$$::a misshapen thing without even a hand, that does not function as an arm.[lr]::
60215::$$$message_0547_0043_0002$$$::All it can do is dumbly strike his opponent. It cannot even hold his daggers.[lr]::
60216::$$$message_0547_0043_0003$$$::Now, it warps.[lr]::
60217::$$$message_0547_0043_0004$$$::Bones bend and break. The skull's arm explodes upward like an abominable wing.::
60218::$$$message_0547_0044_0000$$$::What a bizarre sight.[lr]::
60219::$$$message_0547_0044_0001$$$::What a long, massive arm.[lr]::
60220::$$$message_0547_0044_0002$$$::Where another arm would end in a fist, that is only his elbow.[lr]::
60221::$$$message_0547_0044_0003$$$::It bends into a grotesque forearm and hand that seems sewn into his shoulder.::
60222::$$$message_0547_0045_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60223::$$$message_0547_0045_0001$$$::Saber's thoughts freeze.[lr]::
60224::$$$message_0547_0045_0002$$$::It can reach her.[lr]::
60225::$$$message_0547_0045_0003$$$::That arm is long enough to reach her.[lr]::
60226::$$$message_0547_0045_0004$$$::Once it does, it is sure to gouge out her heart.[lr]::
60227::$$$message_0547_0045_0005$$$::Before she can even tremble, his arm flutters.::
60228::$$$message_0547_0046_0000$$$::The cursed arm is thrust at her like a spear.[lr]::
60229::$$$message_0547_0046_0001$$$::There is a sound of flesh being sliced, and a gout of fresh blood.[lr]::
60230::$$$message_0547_0046_0002$$$::Red liquid splashes on the floor and speckles the black Shadow.::
60231::$$$message_0547_0047_0000$$$::"Keee!"[wfold][imageex page=fore layer=base storage=black][lr]::
60232::$$$message_0547_0047_0001$$$::A shrill cackle escapes the skull mask.[lr]::
60233::$$$message_0547_0047_0002$$$::His outstretched arm is coated in crimson.[lr]::
60234::$$$message_0547_0047_0003$$$::Its deed done, it quickly retracts back towards Assassin.[lr]::
60235::$$$message_0547_0047_0004$$$::"Kee, keekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekeekee!!!"[lr]::
60236::$$$message_0547_0047_0005$$$::He has lost his monstrous arm.::
60237::$$$message_0547_0048_0000$$$::"D-daMn you! whY WOn't You jUST diE!?"[lr]::
60238::$$$message_0547_0048_0001$$$::"Haah...hah...ah..."[lr]::
60239::$$$message_0547_0048_0002$$$::She lowers her sword.[lr]::
60240::$$$message_0547_0048_0003$$$::Assassin's cursed arm never reached Saber.[lr]::
60241::$$$message_0547_0048_0004$$$::Saber repelled the curse before it could extract a mirror image of her heart.::
60242::$$$message_0547_0049_0000$$$::Assassin's Noble Phantasm cannot defeat Saber, even in these dire straits.[lr]::
60243::$$$message_0547_0049_0001$$$::No...[lr]::

60250::$$$message_0547_0051_0002$$$::The Shadow devours her feet and reaches for her waist.[lr]::
60251::$$$message_0547_0051_0003$$$::Not even moonlight can escape its hunger, and now, it has become her.[lr]::
60252::$$$message_0547_0051_0004$$$::It's too late to do anything.::
60253::$$$message_0547_0052_0000$$$::...The Shadow creeps upward.[lr]::
60254::$$$message_0547_0052_0001$$$::It clouds over the silver-clad swordswoman's vision.::
60255::$$$message_0547_0053_0000$$$::"I'm sorry...Shi...rou..."[lr]::
60256::$$$message_0547_0053_0001$$$::She gasps as if craving oxygen, and sinks into the murky swamp.::
