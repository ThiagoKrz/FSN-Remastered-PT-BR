3295::$$$message_0035_0000_0000$$$::"Fuji-nee. You can have some apples if you want, but you'd better eat your quota of tangerines. We still have a whole box of them left, you know."::
3296::$$$message_0035_0001_0000$$$::"Argh, why did you have to remind me? Ugh. I'm so tired of tangerines."[lr]::
3297::$$$message_0035_0001_0001$$$::Fuji-nee's fangs...I mean, her teeth dig into an apple while she complains.::
3298::$$$message_0035_0002_0000$$$::"What do you mean, you're tired of them!? That's why I was against it to begin with. There's just me, Sakura, and you in the house, but you bought over ten pieces of mochi and three boxes of tangerines![lr]::
3299::$$$message_0035_0002_0001$$$::You obviously bought too much for New Year's. It's already February, but we still have a whole box left. If you let them go bad, you're paying for them."::
3300::$$$message_0035_0003_0000$$$::"Ugh... Um, if I may ask...how long does it take for tangerines to rot?"[lr]::
3301::$$$message_0035_0003_0001$$$::"Well, about two weeks to a month at room temperature. So they're nearly done for."[lr]::
3302::$$$message_0035_0003_0002$$$::Well, I'm storing them in a cold room, so we should have a little more time.::
3303::$$$message_0035_0004_0000$$$::"Oh crap. Does that mean they're good to eat, or about to rot?"[lr]::
3304::$$$message_0035_0004_0001$$$::"...Fuji-nee, I beg of you, never live on your own. I've heard some really scary stories about food poisoning. If you live alone, you should at least check the expiration dates on food, and be very careful when you eat fish in summer."::
3305::$$$message_0035_0005_0000$$$::"Don't worry about that. I'll just come to your place if I ever live alone.[lr]::
3306::$$$message_0035_0005_0001$$$::You can give me leftovers."[lr]::
3307::$$$message_0035_0005_0002$$$::"...Like hell I'd give you my leftovers, you dummy.[lr]::
3308::$$$message_0035_0005_0003$$$::You have a huge appetite. If you're going to come for a meal, I'd just make enough for you too."[lr]::
3309::$$$message_0035_0005_0004$$$::I huff as I turn my away and go back to preparing dinner.::
3310::$$$message_0035_0006_0000$$$::"Okay. Then I'll just make tons of money and give you enough to pay for all the ingredients you buy.[lr]::
3311::$$$message_0035_0006_0001$$$::You're a good-for-nothing like Kiritsugu, so money's always tight."::
3312::$$$message_0035_0007_0000$$$::"Big talk, coming from you. Why'd you get so many tangerines anyway? You know Sakura doesn't like those kinds of fruits, and I don't eat much of them either."[lr]::
3313::$$$message_0035_0007_0001$$$::I might as well ask the question that's been bothering me since New Year's.::
3314::$$$message_0035_0008_0000$$$::"Hmmm, no reason. Oh, but don't you think 'orange pekoe' has a nice ring to it?"[lr]::
3315::$$$message_0035_0008_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
3316::$$$message_0035_0008_0002$$$::Well...[lr]::
3317::$$$message_0035_0008_0003$$$::I was a fool to expect sense from Fuji-nee.::
