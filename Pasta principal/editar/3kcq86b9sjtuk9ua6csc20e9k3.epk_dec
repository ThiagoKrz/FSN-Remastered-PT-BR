62550::$$$message_0577_0000_0000$$$::"Sakura, you there?"[lr]::
62551::$$$message_0577_0000_0001$$$::I knock quietly.::
62552::$$$message_0577_0001_0000$$$::"Oh, Senpai?"[lr]::
62553::$$$message_0577_0001_0001$$$::I hear a languid voice from the other side of the door.[lr]::
62554::$$$message_0577_0001_0002$$$::"Oh, just a minute! I'll get changed!"[lr]::
62555::$$$message_0577_0001_0003$$$::She sounds a little panicky. I must have caught her sleeping.[lr]::
62556::$$$message_0577_0001_0004$$$::About two minutes later...::
62557::$$$message_0577_0002_0000$$$::"Thank you for waiting. Please come in."[lr]::
62558::$$$message_0577_0002_0001$$$::"Ah... Okay, pardon me."::
62559::$$$message_0577_0003_0000$$$::I was nervous, standing here waiting to enter a girl's bedroom.[lr]::
62560::$$$message_0577_0003_0001$$$::I've been in this room before, but the situation is different now.[lr]::
62561::$$$message_0577_0003_0002$$$::Back then, Sakura was unconscious. Now, she's inviting me in.::
62562::$$$message_0577_0004_0000$$$::"Did something happen? I was taking a nap, so I couldn't hear."[lr]::
62563::$$$message_0577_0004_0001$$$::"Oh, nothing like that. I'm not here for any particular reason. I just came to see if you were getting enough rest..."[lr]::
62564::$$$message_0577_0004_0002$$$::But I ended up interrupting her sleep.::
62565::$$$message_0577_0005_0000$$$::"Aha, well, I certainly was. I was taking a nice nap."[lr]::
62566::$$$message_0577_0005_0001$$$::"Yeah, sorry for waking you. You know your own body, and I'm sure you wouldn't force yourself to move around when you have a fever... Looks like I was being overprotective."[lr]::
62567::$$$message_0577_0005_0002$$$::I'm disappointed in myself.[lr]::
62568::$$$message_0577_0005_0003$$$::That makes Sakura giggle.::
62569::$$$message_0577_0006_0000$$$::"...Um. Am I overanalyzing you?"[lr]::
62570::$$$message_0577_0006_0001$$$::"No, you're not. You're perceptive.[lr]::
62571::$$$message_0577_0006_0002$$$::I actually wanted to keep cleaning.[lr]::
62572::$$$message_0577_0006_0003$$$::If you hadn't come to my room, I probably would have snuck out."[lr]::
62573::$$$message_0577_0006_0004$$$::"You would have snuck out?"::
62574::$$$message_0577_0007_0000$$$::"Yes. Because I feel fine, so I don't want to stay in bed like a sick person. I was going to try and carry on as usual, even though you told me to rest.[lr]::
62575::$$$message_0577_0007_0001$$$::But I'm sure that'll make my sister upset, too.[lr]::
62576::$$$message_0577_0007_0002$$$::She'd probably say that I would cause even more headaches for her if I collapsed again."::
62577::$$$message_0577_0008_0000$$$::"...Hm."[lr]::
62578::$$$message_0577_0008_0001$$$::...That's true.[lr]::
62579::$$$message_0577_0008_0002$$$::After lunch, I stopped Sakura from cleaning the house.[lr]::
62580::$$$message_0577_0008_0003$$$::But she wouldn't listen to me. I wasn't sure what to do until Tohsaka stepped in.::
62581::$$$message_0577_0009_0000$$$::Still, she didn't exactly ask nicely.[lr]::
62582::$$$message_0577_0009_0001$$$::"If you faint again, we'll have to kill you."[r]::
62583::$$$message_0577_0009_0002$$$::It was an awfully aggressive way to make her back down.::
62584::$$$message_0577_0010_0000$$$::"...Yeah. Tohsaka was mad."[lr]::
62585::$$$message_0577_0010_0001$$$::"Yep, she sure got upset at me."::
62586::$$$message_0577_0011_0000$$$::Sakura seems happy about it.[lr]::
62587::$$$message_0577_0011_0001$$$::...I see now.[lr]::
62588::$$$message_0577_0011_0002$$$::Despite her words, she's happy that Tohsaka is worried about her.::
62589::$$$message_0577_0012_0000$$$::"Then make sure you get some rest, all right?[lr]::
62590::$$$message_0577_0012_0001$$$::Your body's under a lot of strain, no matter how you think you feel. If you rest, then Tohsaka and I can rest easy when we head out."::
62591::$$$message_0577_0013_0000$$$::"...Yeah. But I feel fine, really. I'm just a little off right now, but I'll be okay tomorrow. It's like the cold I had before, so it'll get better overnight."::
62592::$$$message_0577_0014_0000$$$::"...Silly. I know I interrupted your nap, but go lie back down. You should sleep while you can.[lr]::
62593::$$$message_0577_0014_0001$$$::I'll come wake you up for dinner, so take it easy until then."[lr]::
62594::$$$message_0577_0014_0002$$$::I turn to leave.[lr]::
62595::$$$message_0577_0014_0003$$$::But...::
62596::$$$message_0577_0015_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
62597::$$$message_0577_0015_0001$$$::I feel Sakura tug on my shirt sleeve.::
62598::$$$message_0577_0016_0000$$$::"Sakura...?"[lr]::
62599::$$$message_0577_0016_0001$$$::"U-um, I'll sleep like you said to.[lr]::
62600::$$$message_0577_0016_0002$$$::But I'd be happy if you stayed here with me."::
62601::$$$message_0577_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62602::$$$message_0577_0017_0001$$$::It's rare for Sakura to ask to be pampered.[lr]::
62603::$$$message_0577_0017_0002$$$::She usually tries to do everything on her own. Maybe she doesn't want to be a burden to other people.[lr]::
62604::$$$message_0577_0017_0003$$$::And now, she's being a little selfish.[lr]::
62605::$$$message_0577_0017_0004$$$::No, something like this isn't selfish at all, but from her point of view, she's being very indulgent.::
62606::$$$message_0577_0018_0000$$$::That's why she looks so timid as she asks me.[lr]::
62607::$$$message_0577_0018_0001$$$::I'm willing to do anything she asks, but something like this hardly counts as a favor at all.::
62608::$$$message_0577_0019_0000$$$::"...Sure. I'll stay a little longer."[lr]::
62609::$$$message_0577_0019_0001$$$::I agree, suppressing the urge to hug her.[lr]::
62610::$$$message_0577_0019_0002$$$::"Yay! Then I'll make some tea! I have some Chinese tea I was saving for special occasions!"[lr]::
62611::$$$message_0577_0019_0003$$$::Sakura turns to the bedroom door.::
62612::$$$message_0577_0020_0000$$$::"Wait. I'll brew the tea. You stay in bed. It would defeat the whole point of this if you went out there."[lr]::
62613::$$$message_0577_0020_0001$$$::"Ah... Y-you're right. That was silly of me."[lr]::
62614::$$$message_0577_0020_0002$$$::Sakura happily gets back into bed.[lr]::
62615::$$$message_0577_0020_0003$$$::As I walked out, I gave her a gentle pat on the head and went to make tea.::
62616::$$$message_0577_0021_0000$$$::Still, though...[lr]::
62617::$$$message_0577_0021_0001$$$::This is more mentally exhausting than I expected.[lr]::
62618::$$$message_0577_0021_0002$$$::Sakura and I are alone.::
62619::$$$message_0577_0022_0000$$$::"I mean it, though. I've always known that you like my sister. You look so excited whenever she's around."::
62620::$$$message_0577_0023_0000$$$::...Nothing she's saying is entering my brain.[lr]::
62621::$$$message_0577_0023_0001$$$::If I look at her the wrong way, I won't be able to hold myself back.[lr]::
62622::$$$message_0577_0023_0002$$$::...I'm a guy, after all.[lr]::
62623::$$$message_0577_0023_0003$$$::When I think back to the other night, I immediately want to scoop her up in my arms.::
62624::$$$message_0577_0024_0000$$$::"...I'm not charming at all compared to her. It seems like you're fond of Illya, too.[lr]::
62625::$$$message_0577_0024_0001$$$::...Um, do you dislike shy girls?"::
62626::$$$message_0577_0025_0000$$$::I take a deep breath and steady myself.[lr]::
62627::$$$message_0577_0025_0001$$$::I shouldn't do anything too extreme while Sakura's in this state... Though, I suppose that would help her.[lr]::
62628::$$$message_0577_0025_0002$$$::So it isn't a bad thing.[lr]::
62629::$$$message_0577_0025_0003$$$::It isn't bad, but...::
62630::$$$message_0577_0026_0000$$$::"..."::
62631::$$$message_0577_0027_0000$$$::...Oh right, Tohsaka and Illya are right next door![lr]::
62632::$$$message_0577_0027_0001$$$::If we do anything here, they'll know. I'm not ready for the scornful way they'll look at me the next time we're in the living room.::
62633::$$$message_0577_0028_0000$$$::"...Um, Sakura? Did I do something to make you upset?"[lr]::
62634::$$$message_0577_0028_0001$$$::I'm pulled back to reality from my daydream when I realize that Sakura is oddly gloomy.::
62635::$$$message_0577_0029_0000$$$::"...No. You haven't done anything. That's the problem."[lr]::
62636::$$$message_0577_0029_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
62637::$$$message_0577_0029_0002$$$::"Well, um. I was just talking about some delicate topics, but you weren't listening."::
62638::$$$message_0577_0030_0000$$$::"Oof... Sorry, I was daydreaming. Um, I think you mentioned Tohsaka..."[lr]::
62639::$$$message_0577_0030_0001$$$::"Yes, I did. I said that you looked happy when she decided to sleep over."::
62640::$$$message_0577_0031_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
62641::$$$message_0577_0031_0001$$$::...Right.[lr]::
62642::$$$message_0577_0031_0002$$$::I was listening to Sakura talk about our current living situation.::
62643::$$$message_0577_0032_0000$$$::"What about it, though? You like Tohsaka. Aren't you happy she's here?"::
62644::$$$message_0577_0033_0000$$$::"...Yes, I am. But I'm just as anxious, too. Nee-san is everything I aspire to be, and she has so much that I never did. So when she's around me, it's hard to be happy and I don't want to look her in the eye.[lr]::
62645::$$$message_0577_0033_0001$$$::It feels like no matter what she or I do, it ends up with her scolding me."::
62646::$$$message_0577_0034_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62647::$$$message_0577_0034_0001$$$::I think I understand.[lr]::
62648::$$$message_0577_0034_0002$$$::I still have a long way to go, too. If I were suddenly faced with my ideal self, the sight would be too painful and blinding.[lr]::
62649::$$$message_0577_0034_0003$$$::But even if I can empathize...::
62650::$$$message_0577_0035_0000$$$::"...Sakura. You want to be like Tohsaka?"[lr]::
62651::$$$message_0577_0035_0001$$$::I ask her warily.[lr]::
62652::$$$message_0577_0035_0002$$$::It's the kind of question that would spur Tohsaka to knock me out in one punch, if she was here.::
62653::$$$message_0577_0036_0000$$$::"Yes. I've always wanted to be like her. As a girl, I mean, not a mage.[lr]::
62654::$$$message_0577_0036_0001$$$::She can do anything, and she's always so gallant. I want to be as dashing as she is."::
62655::$$$message_0577_0037_0000$$$::Sakura talks about Tohsaka cheerfully.[lr]::
62656::$$$message_0577_0037_0001$$$::...Hm, hm.[lr]::
62657::$$$message_0577_0037_0002$$$::I have mixed feelings about that, but I agree that Tohsaka is pretty cool.[lr]::
62658::$$$message_0577_0037_0003$$$::In fact, I find the way she owns all of her words and actions to be very handsome.::
62659::$$$message_0577_0038_0000$$$::"...I see. But you haven't really talked to her until now because of that deal the Matous and Tohsakas have. You sure know a lot about her, despite that."::
62660::$$$message_0577_0039_0000$$$::"Yeah. I mean, how could I contain my curiosity?[lr]::
62661::$$$message_0577_0039_0001$$$::Neither of us remember much about our childhood days together.[lr]::
62662::$$$message_0577_0039_0002$$$::It was a long time ago.[lr]::
62663::$$$message_0577_0039_0003$$$::All I really knew was the fact that we're biological sisters."::
62664::$$$message_0577_0040_0000$$$::"But I fixated on it, and often watched her from afar.[lr]::
62665::$$$message_0577_0040_0001$$$::I couldn't talk to her, but I heard a lot of rumors about Tohsaka-senpai one year above me."::
62666::$$$message_0577_0041_0000$$$::"Aha... You mean that stuff about her being a flawless honors student.[lr]::
62667::$$$message_0577_0041_0001$$$::She's pretty famous at school, now that you mention it."::
62668::$$$message_0577_0042_0000$$$::"Yes. So it isn't that I couldn't meet her.[lr]::
62669::$$$message_0577_0042_0001$$$::She calls out to me fairly often at school, and I've seen her come watch the kyudo club, too."::
62670::$$$message_0577_0043_0000$$$::"...And every time, I would think: it's enough to know that she's watching me, and just knowing she cares makes me happy. I knew that if I had wished for anything beyond that, she'd end up hating me."::
62671::$$$message_0577_0044_0000$$$::"...? Why would she despise you?"[lr]::
62672::$$$message_0577_0044_0001$$$::"My magecraft is different from my sister's. Magecraft isn't generally limited to a specific purpose, right?[lr]::
62673::$$$message_0577_0044_0002$$$::Even your magecraft creates phenomena to serve various needs. I don't think it was created for a specific, limited purpose."::
62674::$$$message_0577_0045_0000$$$::"Hm... Yeah. There's only so much I can do, but I can choose how to use the things I Strengthen."::
62675::$$$message_0577_0046_0000$$$::"...But that's now how the Matous' magecraft works. The Matou arts are only useful for taking things away from other people.[lr]::
62676::$$$message_0577_0046_0001$$$::They don't have any other use. All they do is cause people pain without showing them how to be happy again."::
62677::$$$message_0577_0047_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
62678::$$$message_0577_0047_0001$$$::I can't answer that.[lr]::
62679::$$$message_0577_0047_0002$$$::After all, I don't know what kind of magecraft the Matous taught Sakura.[lr]::
62680::$$$message_0577_0047_0003$$$::Sakura's ashamed because she feels that she learned magecraft for nefarious purposes.::
62681::$$$message_0577_0048_0000$$$::...So the rift between Sakura and Tohsaka stems from the magical differences between their families.[lr]::
62682::$$$message_0577_0048_0001$$$::The more Sakura despises the magecraft she was taught, the worse her guilty conscience gets.::
62683::$$$message_0577_0049_0000$$$::"Do you dislike your magecraft, Sakura?"[lr]::
62684::$$$message_0577_0049_0001$$$::"Senpai, that's like asking if a person dislikes breathing."::
62685::$$$message_0577_0050_0000$$$::"I don't like or dislike it. But I can't live without it.[lr]::
62686::$$$message_0577_0050_0001$$$::It's the entire reason I was adopted into the Matou household. If I'd failed to become their successor, they would have gotten rid of me."[lr]::
62687::$$$message_0577_0050_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
62688::$$$message_0577_0051_0000$$$::"Oh, please don't look at me that way. My education was difficult, but it isn't as bad as you think it was."::
62689::$$$message_0577_0052_0000$$$::"Besides, it wasn't as hard as yours.[lr]::
62690::$$$message_0577_0052_0001$$$::I can handle getting hurt by others, but I'm afraid of hurting myself.[lr]::
62691::$$$message_0577_0052_0002$$$::I want to live, so I can't do things that go against that desire.[lr]::
62692::$$$message_0577_0052_0003$$$::I've come to terms with the fact that I'll die eventually, but the thought of dying at my own hands is terrifying."::
62693::$$$message_0577_0053_0000$$$::"But you do both of those things... Um, I've seen the kind of training you do at night.[lr]::
62694::$$$message_0577_0053_0001$$$::I-I only looked once, okay? I came back to get something I forgot at the house, when I heard something in the shed, so I went to look."::
62695::$$$message_0577_0054_0000$$$::Sakura dips her head apologetically.[lr]::
62696::$$$message_0577_0054_0001$$$::But her apology is just making me uneasy.::
62697::$$$message_0577_0055_0000$$$::"Oh, you don't have to apologize. I was careless, and I should've realized you were there. I'm a failure of a mage for not paying more attention to my surroundings."::
62698::$$$message_0577_0056_0000$$$::"...Um, it was..."[lr]::
62699::$$$message_0577_0056_0001$$$::"When did that happen, anyway? Was it right after you started coming over?"[lr]::
62700::$$$message_0577_0056_0002$$$::I sure hope it was.[lr]::
62701::$$$message_0577_0056_0003$$$::I've made a fair bit of progress, even it was at a snail's pace.[lr]::
62702::$$$message_0577_0056_0004$$$::If it happened recently, and I still couldn't notice her presence, then it would mean that I haven't grown at all since my early days.::
62703::$$$message_0577_0057_0000$$$::"...It was around summer last year. Ms. Fujimura brought watermelons home that day."[lr]::
62704::$$$message_0577_0057_0001$$$::"...Oh, good."[lr]::
62705::$$$message_0577_0057_0002$$$::I sigh in relief.[lr]::
62706::$$$message_0577_0057_0003$$$::If it was half a year ago, then that's an excuse I can make.::
62707::$$$message_0577_0058_0000$$$::"So, um...what did you think when you saw it?"[lr]::
62708::$$$message_0577_0058_0001$$$::That's the first time someone other than Kiritsugu saw me practicing magecraft.[lr]::
62709::$$$message_0577_0058_0002$$$::I did a few examples in front of Tohsaka the other day, but that was a lot different from my training in the shed.::
62710::$$$message_0577_0059_0000$$$::In that sense, hearing Sakura's opinion is like having a teacher give me feedback after an exam.[lr]::
62711::$$$message_0577_0059_0001$$$::She's a Matou mage too, so maybe she'll give me a good score...::
62712::$$$message_0577_0060_0000$$$::"Um. I'd like to exercise my right to silence. I'm not my sister, but if I were to assign you a test score, you wouldn't like it."[lr]::
62713::$$$message_0577_0060_0001$$$::"Oof. That bad, huh?"[lr]::
62714::$$$message_0577_0060_0002$$$::"Ahaha. There would be red marks all over your answer sheet."::
62715::$$$message_0577_0061_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62716::$$$message_0577_0061_0001$$$::...Oh, man.[lr]::
62717::$$$message_0577_0061_0002$$$::Sometimes you're more like your sister than you think, Sakura.::
62718::$$$message_0577_0062_0000$$$::"But Senpai? That was the only time I saw you... Which is to say, it isn't that I wanted to stop watching you, but it scared me so badly that I couldn't bear to watch again."[lr]::
62719::$$$message_0577_0062_0001$$$::"Huh? You were too scared to watch?"::
62720::$$$message_0577_0063_0000$$$::"Yes. And I wanted to stop you, so many times.[lr]::
62721::$$$message_0577_0063_0001$$$::...The way you train isn't normal. It was like you were stabbing yourself in the throat. That isn't a metaphor, it's what it actually looked like... That's how dangerous your training seemed to me."::
62722::$$$message_0577_0064_0000$$$::I know what Sakura's trying to say.[lr]::
62723::$$$message_0577_0064_0001$$$::Every time I manifest my Magic Circuits, I flirt with death.[lr]::
62724::$$$message_0577_0064_0002$$$::If my focus slips by so much as a millimeter while I'm wrapping my consciousness around my innards, I could end up blasting them out of my body.[lr]::
62725::$$$message_0577_0064_0003$$$::But isn't that the price every mage has to pay?[lr]::
62726::$$$message_0577_0064_0004$$$::My old man said that death would always walk at my side.::
62727::$$$message_0577_0065_0000$$$::"...Yeah. That's what I heard mages are supposed to do, but maybe I'm doing it in a really risky way because I'm too inexperienced."::
62728::$$$message_0577_0066_0000$$$::"That's not what I meant. It isn't about your skill level or experience. To begin with, the fact that you can use magecraft at all even though it isn't in your nature is what makes you different.[lr]::
62729::$$$message_0577_0066_0001$$$::Magecraft isn't something you use, but something you teach your body. No normal mage would manifest Magic Circuits every time they want to use magecraft."::
62730::$$$message_0577_0067_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
62731::$$$message_0577_0067_0001$$$::"I'm talking about the final outcome.[lr]::
62732::$$$message_0577_0067_0002$$$::...Every night, you've been killing yourself. Nobody is forcing you, and you aren't even doing it for your own sake. You just stubbornly stuck to that routine, all by yourself."::
62733::$$$message_0577_0068_0000$$$::"...I don't think even my sister could bring herself to do that.[lr]::
62734::$$$message_0577_0068_0001$$$::When you make up your mind, you stick to your decision until the very end, whether it's good or evil. That's why I think you're the strongest person among us."::
62735::$$$message_0577_0069_0000$$$::"Wait..."[lr]::
62736::$$$message_0577_0069_0001$$$::It's incredibly embarrassing to hear you say that with a straight face, Sakura.::
62737::$$$message_0577_0070_0000$$$::"F-flattery will get you nowhere, stupid![lr]::
62738::$$$message_0577_0070_0001$$$::T-Tohsaka's definitely stronger than me, and I don't know what kind of mage you are but you're still the Matou heir, and you have Rider...!"::
62739::$$$message_0577_0071_0000$$$::"No, you're strong, Senpai. Not because of your Magic Circuits or your magical affinity, but because you have a pure heart.[lr]::
62740::$$$message_0577_0071_0001$$$::...I've known that ever since we met.[lr]::
62741::$$$message_0577_0071_0002$$$::I know that you'll never betray anyone or anything."::
62742::$$$message_0577_0072_0000$$$::"Uh...um..."[lr]::
62743::$$$message_0577_0072_0001$$$::When she says it that seriously, I can't protest.::
62744::$$$message_0577_0073_0000$$$::"...Thanks. Coming from you, that means a lot, even if it's just flattery."[lr]::
62745::$$$message_0577_0073_0001$$$::I say what I really feel, even though I'm embarrassed.[lr]::
62746::$$$message_0577_0073_0002$$$::Sakura smiles, looking right back into[lr]::
62747::$$$message_0577_0073_0003$$$::my eyes.::
62748::$$$message_0577_0074_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
62749::$$$message_0577_0074_0001$$$::Uh oh.[lr]::
62750::$$$message_0577_0074_0002$$$::If she looks at me that way, it's going to bring back the fantasies I had finally managed to shake off earlier.::
62751::$$$message_0577_0075_0000$$$::"...Um, I should be getting back. You're sleepy, right? And there's still tonight, so you should rest while you can."[lr]::
62752::$$$message_0577_0075_0001$$$::I awkwardly clear my throat.[lr]::
62753::$$$message_0577_0075_0002$$$::I try to find a place to point my eyes, and settle on the wall separating this room from Tohsaka's.::
62754::$$$message_0577_0076_0000$$$::"R-right. It's still early, and Nee-san is next door."[lr]::
62755::$$$message_0577_0076_0001$$$::Tohsaka blushes and looks around uneasily too, as if sensing what I'm thinking.[lr]::
62756::$$$message_0577_0076_0002$$$::...I'm sure I'm making the same face.::
62757::$$$message_0577_0077_0000$$$::"I'll go back to my room now. And I'll come get you when it's dinner time."[lr]::
62758::$$$message_0577_0077_0001$$$::"Ah...um, please wait!"[lr]::
62759::$$$message_0577_0077_0002$$$::"Wait? For what?"::
62760::$$$message_0577_0078_0000$$$::"U-um... I would like it if you stayed here until I fall asleep..."[lr]::
62761::$$$message_0577_0078_0001$$$::I find myself chuckling as she stutters while trying to ask for something.[lr]::
62762::$$$message_0577_0078_0002$$$::I wish I could ask her to do the same for me.::
62763::$$$message_0577_0079_0000$$$::"Sure. I'll stay if it doesn't bother you. I'll leave once you're asleep, all right?"::
62764::$$$message_0577_0080_0000$$$::"O-okay! Of course! I'll do my best to stay awake!"[lr]::
62765::$$$message_0577_0080_0001$$$::Look, Sakura.[lr]::
62766::$$$message_0577_0080_0002$$$::I'm happy to hear you say that, but then there's no point in me staying here.::
62767::$$$message_0577_0081_0000$$$::Once Sakura lies down, she suddenly becomes quiet.[lr]::
62768::$$$message_0577_0081_0001$$$::She must be really tired, if she's passing out as soon as she lies down.::
62769::$$$message_0577_0082_0000$$$::But before that happens...[lr]::
62770::$$$message_0577_0082_0001$$$::"Senpai. I should feel better after resting for a whole day, but how's your arm doing?"[lr]::
62771::$$$message_0577_0082_0002$$$::She starts talking to me again. I guess she doesn't intend to sleep after all.::
62772::$$$message_0577_0083_0000$$$::"My arm's fine. It doesn't hurt as long as I keep this wrap on, and I'm starting to be able to move it, little by little. Maybe I can start using it normally tomorrow."::
62773::$$$message_0577_0084_0000$$$::"Thank goodness. It's been a long time since Nee-san treated your arm, right? It was just an emergency measure, so it probably isn't working anymore."::
62774::$$$message_0577_0085_0000$$$::"A long time?"[lr]::
62775::$$$message_0577_0085_0001$$$::"You know how she is. It was nice of her to use her Magic Crest, but all she did was buy you time. She knows it won't even last seven days."::
62776::$$$message_0577_0086_0000$$$::Sakura's tone is casual.[lr]::
62777::$$$message_0577_0086_0001$$$::But she said...[lr]::
62778::$$$message_0577_0086_0002$$$::"Seven...days...?"[lr]::
62779::$$$message_0577_0086_0003$$$::The words sound terribly out of place.::
62780::$$$message_0577_0087_0000$$$::"Yeah! It's probably about to run out, so make sure you ask her to follow up. I can't help you with the Matou magecraft, but Rider might have some good ideas..."[lr]::
62781::$$$message_0577_0087_0001$$$::She starts to doze off as she talks.::
62782::$$$message_0577_0088_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62783::$$$message_0577_0088_0001$$$::I can't think of anything to say.[lr]::
62784::$$$message_0577_0088_0002$$$::...All I can do is convince myself that she made a mistake because she's falling asleep.::
62785::$$$message_0577_0089_0000$$$::"...Are you still there, Senpai?"[lr]::
62786::$$$message_0577_0089_0001$$$::"Yeah, I'm here."[lr]::
62787::$$$message_0577_0089_0002$$$::"...Good. Please stay with me.[lr]::
62788::$$$message_0577_0089_0003$$$::I have scary dreams when I'm alone, so...please..."[lr]::
62789::$$$message_0577_0089_0004$$$::Sakura's eyes slowly close.[lr]::
62790::$$$message_0577_0089_0005$$$::I hear her breathing become slow and steady once she falls into a deep sleep.::
62791::$$$message_0577_0090_0000$$$::I turn off the lights and quietly leave the bedroom.[lr]::
62792::$$$message_0577_0090_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
62793::$$$message_0577_0090_0002$$$::Dark, stormy clouds fill my heart, in contrast to her tranquil expression.::
62794::$$$message_0577_0091_0000$$$::"Please keep an eye on me."::
62795::$$$message_0577_0092_0000$$$::...Just as she's about to fall asleep…[lr]::
62796::$$$message_0577_0092_0001$$$::I can't help but feel that she said that unconsciously.::
