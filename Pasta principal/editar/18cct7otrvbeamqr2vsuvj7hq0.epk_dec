75683::$$$message_0697_0000_0000$$$::I'll protect Illya.[lr]::
75684::$$$message_0697_0000_0001$$$::I can't protect two people at once.[lr]::
75685::$$$message_0697_0000_0002$$$::Tohsaka has Archer, but Illya has nobody else.[lr]::
75686::$$$message_0697_0000_0003$$$::So, I have to protect her[lr]::
75687::$$$message_0697_0000_0004$$$::in Berserker's place!::
75688::$$$message_0697_0001_0000$$$::"Illya, get down!"[lr]::
75689::$$$message_0697_0001_0001$$$::I tackle her to the ground.[lr]::
75690::$$$message_0697_0001_0002$$$::Just as I cover her with my body,[lr]::
75691::$$$message_0697_0001_0003$$$::my sight and spirit are dyed jet black.::
75692::$$$message_0697_0002_0000$$$::"Ah..."::
75693::$$$message_0697_0003_0000$$$::                                                        It's hot.::
75694::$$$message_0697_0004_0000$$$::I feel like my body's about to be blown away.[lr]::
75695::$$$message_0697_0004_0001$$$::A wave of compressed magical energy erupts into a tempest that violates the whole forest.::
75696::$$$message_0697_0005_0000$$$::                                                       Nothing.::
75697::$$$message_0697_0006_0000$$$::My vision is all black.[lr]::
75698::$$$message_0697_0006_0001$$$::It's so dark, even though I can see clearly. I must have fallen into a black sun.::
75699::$$$message_0697_0007_0000$$$::                                           I have no self. No body.::
75700::$$$message_0697_0008_0000$$$::It must have been melted by the sun.[lr]::
75701::$$$message_0697_0008_0001$$$::I have no body.[lr]::
75702::$$$message_0697_0008_0002$$$::The complete sensory loss is more revolting than any pain.::
75703::$$$message_0697_0009_0000$$$::"Hah...ah...ah..."[lr]::
75704::$$$message_0697_0009_0001$$$::But that's a problem.[lr]::
75705::$$$message_0697_0009_0002$$$::I can't protect Illya without my body.[lr]::
75706::$$$message_0697_0009_0003$$$::The black Shadow will try to take Illya away.[lr]::
75707::$$$message_0697_0009_0004$$$::I use my right arm to resist as best as I can.[lr]::
75708::$$$message_0697_0009_0005$$$::I hug Illya with my right arm and hold onto the ground.::
75709::$$$message_0697_0010_0000$$$::"Hah...ah."[lr]::
75710::$$$message_0697_0010_0001$$$::That's when I finally realize it.[lr]::
75711::$$$message_0697_0010_0002$$$::I do have a body. After all, I can't protect Illya without a body.[lr]::
75712::$$$message_0697_0010_0003$$$::...Wow, I'm being so dramatic.[lr]::
75713::$$$message_0697_0010_0004$$$::I'm only missing everything from my left shoulder.[lr]::
75714::$$$message_0697_0010_0005$$$::It's all gone.[lr]::
75715::$$$message_0697_0010_0006$$$::My body is still here. I'm still here.::
75716::$$$message_0697_0011_0000$$$::...But so is the feeling of loss.[lr]::
75717::$$$message_0697_0011_0001$$$::"It's not like [font italic=true]every[font italic=false] part of me got wiped out. But..." [r]I still feel a deep sense of loss, as if I really have lost my whole body.::
75718::$$$message_0697_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75719::$$$message_0697_0012_0001$$$::...I'm disappearing.[lr]::
75720::$$$message_0697_0012_0002$$$::The Shadow melts away without a trace, as if it's expended all its power.::
75721::$$$message_0697_0013_0000$$$::...Illya's safe.[lr]::
75722::$$$message_0697_0013_0001$$$::I don't know what she's saying. Maybe my ears are ringing.::
75723::$$$message_0697_0014_0000$$$::Tohsaka...I wonder how she's doing.[lr]::
75724::$$$message_0697_0014_0001$$$::Archer...is there.[lr]::
75725::$$$message_0697_0014_0002$$$::His red cloak is soaked in blood, and he looks so weak, like he's about to disappear.::
75726::$$$message_0697_0015_0000$$$::...That's weird.[lr]::
75727::$$$message_0697_0015_0001$$$::What's she doing here?::
75728::$$$message_0697_0016_0000$$$::"...Have you lost your mind? If you do that, you'll[line2]"[lr]::
75729::$$$message_0697_0016_0001$$$::"There's nothing to consider. If I do nothing, two will die. But if I transplant this, I'm sure to save one.[lr]::
75730::$$$message_0697_0016_0002$$$::...At any rate, this body has reached its limit. If I'm going to disappear anyway, then it doesn't hurt to try."::
75731::$$$message_0697_0017_0000$$$::Archer's...talking to...Rider.::
75732::$$$message_0697_0018_0000$$$::...I wonder what's happening.[lr]::
75733::$$$message_0697_0018_0001$$$::In the end, he...[lr]::
75734::$$$message_0697_0018_0002$$$::"Normally, he would die. You can't save a person by attaching a spiritual body to theirs. But he and I are a special case. Rin will know what to do once she wakes up."[lr]::
75735::$$$message_0697_0018_0003$$$::Just once, he lovingly touches Tohsaka's hair.::
75736::$$$message_0697_0019_0000$$$::    Everything's growing dark.[lr]::
75737::$$$message_0697_0019_0001$$$::The black sun is gone.[lr]::
75738::$$$message_0697_0019_0002$$$::So, this must be...[lr]::
75739::$$$message_0697_0019_0003$$$::...my mind, sinking into the dark.[lr]::
75740::$$$message_0697_0019_0004$$$::"...This is as far as I go. Be well, Tohsaka."[lr]::
75741::$$$message_0697_0019_0005$$$::Archer says a goodbye in a voice that sounds just like mine.::
