59659::$$$message_0542_0000_0000$$$::"Time to start homeroom![lr]::
59660::$$$message_0542_0000_0001$$$::Start us off[line2]oh, Aikawa's absent, and so is Aimono? Hmm, then I guess I'll do it. Atten-shun!"::
59661::$$$message_0542_0001_0000$$$::Homeroom begins.[lr]::
59662::$$$message_0542_0001_0001$$$::More students are absent than yesterday, and the classroom feels less lively.[lr]::
59663::$$$message_0542_0001_0002$$$::Not just our classroom, actually. The entire school feels muted.[lr]::
59664::$$$message_0542_0001_0003$$$::Fuji-nee moves homeroom along in a breezy tone, but even she doesn't look as upbeat as usual.::
59665::$$$message_0542_0002_0000$$$::"And on that note, after-school club meetings are suspended.[lr]::
59666::$$$message_0542_0002_0001$$$::That's all the announcements I have today. By the way, your first period teacher Mr. Kuzuki is out, so you can just self-study. I brought printouts, so just stay here in the classroom."::
59667::$$$message_0542_0003_0000$$$::The room collectively celebrates, and begins to move desks around with a clatter.[lr]::
59668::$$$message_0542_0003_0001$$$::Fuji-nee's just going to let us do our worksheets at our own pace, meaning we can do whatever we want as long as we stay in the room. But...::
59669::$$$message_0542_0004_0000$$$::"Shirou, one sec!"[lr]::
59670::$$$message_0542_0004_0001$$$::...Why is she waving me over in the hallway in such an obviously suspicious manner?::
59671::$$$message_0542_0005_0000$$$::"What, Fuji-nee? We're still in class."[lr]::
59672::$$$message_0542_0005_0001$$$::"Yeah, but I didn't come over this morning, right? I just got worried that you might not be doing ok."[lr]::
59673::$$$message_0542_0005_0002$$$::"? Where's this coming from? What are you worried about?"::
59674::$$$message_0542_0006_0000$$$::"Mm, I'm not really sure. Just a feeling in my bones, I guess?[lr]::
59675::$$$message_0542_0006_0001$$$::I've always had this tingly feeling that I get sometimes before you get hit by a car or fall off a bridge. That's why I wanted to see if you're okay."[lr]::
59676::$$$message_0542_0006_0002$$$::"Uh-huh. Well, I'm doing just fine. If anything, I'm safer now then I've ever been before."::
59677::$$$message_0542_0007_0000$$$::"Mm, yeah, but I just wonder...[lr]::
59678::$$$message_0542_0007_0001$$$::It's a feeling like there's this train we need to get on together, but you stay behind on the platform waving goodbye at me, or something."[lr]::
59679::$$$message_0542_0007_0002$$$::"Hmm... That's a pretty specific example. And I'm guessing you had a dream like that before you woke up today."::
59680::$$$message_0542_0008_0000$$$::"Oh, could you tell? I overslept because of that!"[lr]::
59681::$$$message_0542_0008_0001$$$::"..."::
59682::$$$message_0542_0009_0000$$$::I'm kind of amazed.[lr]::
59683::$$$message_0542_0009_0001$$$::So she didn't come over because she overslept. No other reason.[lr]::
59684::$$$message_0542_0009_0002$$$::...Okay. That's very Fuji-nee, so I'll allow it.::
59685::$$$message_0542_0010_0000$$$::"No worries. I'm the same as I always am. On the other hand, you've got dark circles around your eyes. I think it's more than just dreams making you miss sleep."::
59686::$$$message_0542_0011_0000$$$::"Huh? Well, yeah. I was busy yesterday, and think it's going to be busy today, too. I'll probably have to keep pulling overtime, so I might not be coming over for a while. Sorry, but you don't have to leave any food for me."::
59687::$$$message_0542_0012_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
59688::$$$message_0542_0012_0001$$$::"I just wanted to let you know. Make sure you do your worksheets, Shirou. You have bad grades in Modern Society. You're going to start failing unless you put more work into it."::
59689::$$$message_0542_0013_0000$$$::Fuji-nee gives me a casual wave goodbye and leaves.::
59690::$$$message_0542_0014_0000$$$::"...She doesn't need food? I guess that's a load off my back."[lr]::
59691::$$$message_0542_0014_0001$$$::I feel a little let down and less motivated.[lr]::
59692::$$$message_0542_0014_0002$$$::It's a hollow feeling, like my regular life has disappeared.::
