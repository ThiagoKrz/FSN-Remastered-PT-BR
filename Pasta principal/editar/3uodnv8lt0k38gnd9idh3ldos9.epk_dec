70982::$$$message_0651_0000_0001$$$::I'll trust her. [lr]::
70983::$$$message_0651_0000_0002$$$::I have to trust her and wait.::
70984::$$$message_0651_0001_0000$$$::How would rushing in to attack Saber help now?[lr]::
70985::$$$message_0651_0001_0001$$$::What could I possibly do with the Projection I've been keeping at the ready?[lr]::
70986::$$$message_0651_0001_0002$$$::We've already decided our battle plan.[lr]::
70987::$$$message_0651_0001_0003$$$::Rider accepted it and recognized me as her temporary Master.[lr]::
70988::$$$message_0651_0001_0004$$$::So, I need to...::
70989::$$$message_0651_0002_0000$$$::"Ngh...!"[lr]::
70990::$$$message_0651_0002_0001$$$::Saber slices through empty air.[lr]::
70991::$$$message_0651_0002_0002$$$::Rider's already retreated out of her range,[lr]::
70992::$$$message_0651_0002_0003$$$::as far as possible.[lr]::
70993::$$$message_0651_0002_0004$$$::She withdraws to the very edge of the cave.::
70994::$$$message_0651_0003_0000$$$::Saber doesn't give chase.[lr]::
70995::$$$message_0651_0003_0001$$$::Her legs are bound in Rider's chains.[lr]::
70996::$$$message_0651_0003_0002$$$::That's why Rider was kneeling.[lr]::
70997::$$$message_0651_0003_0003$$$::She persistently attacked Saber's upper body but used her last move to chain her legs and drive the daggers into the ground, restricting her mobility.::
70998::$$$message_0651_0004_0000$$$::"You think this is enough to stop me!?"[lr]::
70999::$$$message_0651_0004_0001$$$::Magical energy surges through Saber's whole body.[lr]::
71000::$$$message_0651_0004_0002$$$::Wreathed in lightning, she easily destroys the chains.::
71001::$$$message_0651_0005_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
71002::$$$message_0651_0005_0001$$$::But it's too late.[lr]::
71003::$$$message_0651_0005_0002$$$::It was only a two-second delay, but that was more than enough time for Rider to "wind up."::
71004::$$$message_0651_0006_0000$$$::"A Noble Phantasm!"[lr]::
71005::$$$message_0651_0006_0001$$$::Fifty meters separate them.[lr]::
71006::$$$message_0651_0006_0002$$$::Seeing the distance between them, Saber instantly divines Rider's intent.[lr]::
71007::$$$message_0651_0006_0003$$$::She only has one way to counter it.[lr]::
71008::$$$message_0651_0006_0004$$$::She'll answer Rider's ultimate attack with her own.::
71009::$$$message_0651_0007_0000$$$::    There's a torrent of dark light.[lr]::
71010::$$$message_0651_0007_0001$$$::The wind coils, and Saber's sword glows red-hot.[lr]::
71011::$$$message_0651_0007_0002$$$::The comet will likely attack in one second.[lr]::
71012::$$$message_0651_0007_0003$$$::She deploys her strongest Noble Phantasm to cleave through Rider's pure-white light.::
71013::$$$message_0651_0008_0000$$$::"SABER!!!"[lr]::
71014::$$$message_0651_0008_0001$$$::Rider shifts her posture.[lr]::
71015::$$$message_0651_0008_0002$$$::The summoning circle is complete.[lr]::
71016::$$$message_0651_0008_0003$$$::A giant red eyeball appears in front of her.::
71017::$$$message_0651_0009_0000$$$::"Come at me, Rider!"[lr]::
71018::$$$message_0651_0009_0001$$$::Saber shifts her blade sideways.[lr]::
71019::$$$message_0651_0009_0002$$$::Starlight coalesces and rotates, achieving criticality.[lr]::
71020::$$$message_0651_0009_0003$$$::The black sun grasps that flare in both hands.::
71021::$$$message_0651_0010_0000$$$::"BELLERO..."[lr]::
71022::$$$message_0651_0010_0001$$$::Rider chants its True Name.[lr]::
71023::$$$message_0651_0010_0002$$$::She is instantly enveloped in white.::
71024::$$$message_0651_0011_0000$$$::"EX..."[lr]::
71025::$$$message_0651_0011_0001$$$::Saber unveils its True Name.[lr]::
71026::$$$message_0651_0011_0002$$$::Her sword blazes into black fire.::
71027::$$$message_0651_0012_0000$$$::                                                    "...PHON!!!"[r]::

71029::$$$message_0651_0012_0002$$$::Two rays of light flood the chamber, struggling for dominance!::
71030::$$$message_0651_0013_0000$$$::Time stops for an instant.[lr]::
71031::$$$message_0651_0013_0001$$$::Shirou Emiya accelerates his inner world, disguising a moment as eternity.::

71035::$$$message_0651_0015_0000$$$::This is my second Projection.[lr]::
71036::$$$message_0651_0015_0001$$$::Magecraft which erodes my body.[lr]::
71037::$$$message_0651_0015_0002$$$::But I can't defeat Saber without it.[lr]::
71038::$$$message_0651_0015_0003$$$::Rider can't overcome Saber's Noble Phantasm, not even with Bellerophon.::
71039::$$$message_0651_0016_0000$$$::We both know that.[lr]::
71040::$$$message_0651_0016_0001$$$::     So I'll help her win.[lr]::
71041::$$$message_0651_0016_0002$$$::If Rider's Noble Phantasm lacks destructive power, I just need to make up for it...!::
71042::$$$message_0651_0017_0000$$$::"My body is made of swords. (I am the bone of my sword.)"::
71043::$$$message_0651_0018_0000$$$::I've decided what I'll use.[lr]::
71044::$$$message_0651_0018_0001$$$::I complete the Projection in an instant.[lr]::
71045::$$$message_0651_0018_0002$$$::I'll make Rider win, using the greatest defense Archer knows...::
71046::$$$message_0651_0019_0000$$$::"Rho Aias!"::
71047::$$$message_0651_0020_0000$$$::I intone its True Name and turn it into reality!::
71048::$$$message_0651_0020_0001$$$::"Gah!"[lr]::
71049::$$$message_0651_0020_0002$$$::I thrust out my left arm, and it shakes.[lr]::
71050::$$$message_0651_0020_0003$$$::The nerves, muscles, and blood vessels in it are going haywire.[lr]::
71051::$$$message_0651_0020_0004$$$::It feels like it could snap at any second, and I desperately stabilize it with my right hand.::
71052::$$$message_0651_0021_0000$$$::"Nnrgh! Ah, ah, ahhh...!"[lr]::
71053::$$$message_0651_0021_0001$$$::Endure it.[lr]::
71054::$$$message_0651_0021_0002$$$::I can't stop the Projection yet.[lr]::
71055::$$$message_0651_0021_0003$$$::The two pillars of light are still pushing against each other.[lr]::

71067::$$$message_0651_0024_0001$$$::It completely upsets the rivalry between the two powers.::

71072::$$$message_0651_0025_0001$$$::Rider slams into a wall unprotected, with the same speed as her charge.[lr]::
71073::$$$message_0651_0025_0002$$$::Saber is blown away by Bellerophon's light, and falls to the ground on her back.::
