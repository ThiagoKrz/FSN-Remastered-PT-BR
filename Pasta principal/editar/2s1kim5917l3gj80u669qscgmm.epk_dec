37543::$$$message_0323_0000_0000$$$::It's time for the long-awaited dinner.[lr]::
37544::$$$message_0323_0000_0001$$$::On the table, there's the crab egg foo young that Fuji-nee made for the three of us.[lr]::
37545::$$$message_0323_0000_0002$$$::It's a simple dish where there's rice in a bowl and one serving of the omelet on top of it.[lr]::
37546::$$$message_0323_0000_0003$$$::It looks like there's a yellow lid on the bowl, which doesn't really look that good.::
37547::$$$message_0323_0001_0000$$$::But, it should make the rice taste better since it's in a bowl.[lr]::
37548::$$$message_0323_0001_0001$$$::It's like a cutlet rice bowl or tempura rice bowl.[lr]::
37549::$$$message_0323_0001_0002$$$::There's no way it can be bad because the topping's flavor seeps into the rice evenly.[lr]::
37550::$$$message_0323_0001_0003$$$::The only downside is that the flavor would be rather mild, but it's a luxurious problem to have.::
37551::$$$message_0323_0002_0000$$$::"Well, dig in."[lr]::
37552::$$$message_0323_0002_0001$$$::"Yes, bon appétit."[lr]::
37553::$$$message_0323_0002_0002$$$::"Thank you."[lr]::
37554::$$$message_0323_0002_0003$$$::We all bow and start into our bowls.::
37555::$$$message_0323_0003_0000$$$::    But...[lr]::
37556::$$$message_0323_0003_0001$$$::There's not an ounce of softness in the egg foo young. In fact, the strange texture is more like that of a main dish.::
37557::$$$message_0323_0004_0000$$$::"N-NO WAY!?[lr]::
37558::$$$message_0323_0004_0001$$$::We have an emergency! The crab egg foo young turned into something else...!!!"::
37559::$$$message_0323_0005_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
37560::$$$message_0323_0005_0001$$$::...This isn't an emergency or anything.[lr]::
37561::$$$message_0323_0005_0002$$$::This is more like okonomiyaki over rice.::
37562::$$$message_0323_0006_0000$$$::"Hey, how did this happen!? I made it just like I was told!?"[lr]::
37563::$$$message_0323_0006_0001$$$::"...Wow. Did your family really teach you how to make this?"::
37564::$$$message_0323_0007_0000$$$::"Yeah. I told them I'd be making a big omelet, so they gave me flour and other stuff."[lr]::
37565::$$$message_0323_0007_0001$$$::"..."::
37566::$$$message_0323_0008_0000$$$::I wish she realized her mistake at that point.[lr]::
37567::$$$message_0323_0008_0001$$$::Until now, I thought that being able to make an omelet was a basic function every human being was born with.[lr]::
37568::$$$message_0323_0008_0002$$$::A crab egg foo young is only really an advanced version of an omelet.[lr]::
37569::$$$message_0323_0008_0003$$$::So it was my mistake to assume that Fuji-nee couldn't mess up something like that.[lr]::
37570::$$$message_0323_0008_0004$$$::That's right, Fuji-nee can't even cook an omelet...!::
37571::$$$message_0323_0009_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
37572::$$$message_0323_0009_0001$$$::...Then...[lr]::
37573::$$$message_0323_0009_0002$$$::I hear a voice filled with disappointment coming from my side.[lr]::
37574::$$$message_0323_0009_0003$$$::"Saber...?"[lr]::
37575::$$$message_0323_0009_0004$$$::I slowly turn to her.::
37576::$$$message_0323_0010_0000$$$::"...Shirou. This is hard to eat even for me."[lr]::
37577::$$$message_0323_0010_0001$$$::...Yikes. It's hard to tell, but Saber seems mad...::
37578::$$$message_0323_0011_0000$$$::...The nightmare of a dinner ends, and it's time for a strategy meeting.[lr]::
37579::$$$message_0323_0011_0001$$$::But I've already reported to Saber about what happened today.[lr]::
37580::$$$message_0323_0011_0002$$$::Since it's likely that there'll be a battle tomorrow, we might as well prepare.::
37581::$$$message_0323_0012_0000$$$::"Then, we will not be going out tonight, Shirou?"[lr]::
37582::$$$message_0323_0012_0001$$$::"...Yeah. I'm sure it's frustrating for you, but sit tight for tonight. I don't intend to fight needless battles, and more than anything, we're not in a place to be able to fight freely."::
37583::$$$message_0323_0013_0000$$$::I'm inexperienced as a Master, and Saber has a limit to how many times she can battle since I'm not able to provide her with any magical energy.[lr]::
37584::$$$message_0323_0013_0001$$$::Given our situation, it's not a good idea to be aimlessly looking around for Masters.::
37585::$$$message_0323_0014_0000$$$::"...Understood. You certainly do have a point. It is not proactive, but we do need to exercise utmost caution in order to win."::
37586::$$$message_0323_0015_0000$$$::"...However. If you have the will to fight, we must not waste any time. If we are to stay here tonight, then we should use this time to train."::
37587::$$$message_0323_0016_0000$$$::Saber stares at me.[lr]::
37588::$$$message_0323_0016_0001$$$::She doesn't even need to tell me.[lr]::
37589::$$$message_0323_0016_0002$$$::I brought Saber to this dojo with that in mind.::
37590::$$$message_0323_0017_0000$$$::"I know. Do you remember what happened last night?[lr]::
37591::$$$message_0323_0017_0001$$$::We had a match since you told me that I was slacking off for coming home late... Actually, it was less of a match and more of a one-sided beatdown.[lr]::
37592::$$$message_0323_0017_0002$$$::...That was a good lesson. No matter what I do, there's going to be those I can't beat. That was never more apparent than when I fought you."::
37593::$$$message_0323_0018_0000$$$::"With that in mind, I think it's important to train with you.[lr]::
37594::$$$message_0323_0018_0001$$$::I don't know how effective it'll be, but I should be able to survive a bit longer in battle if you're hard on me."::
37595::$$$message_0323_0019_0000$$$::"Then, Shirou..."[lr]::
37596::$$$message_0323_0019_0001$$$::"Yeah. Please train me whenever we have the time.[lr]::
37597::$$$message_0323_0019_0002$$$::For today, that'll be until we go to bed."::
37598::$$$message_0323_0020_0000$$$::I take the bamboo sword on the wall.[lr]::
37599::$$$message_0323_0020_0001$$$::It's 8 PM.[lr]::
37600::$$$message_0323_0020_0002$$$::There's still four hours until bedtime, so I'll train my heart...out...!?::
37601::$$$message_0323_0021_0000$$$::"H-hold on, Saber!!!"[lr]::
37602::$$$message_0323_0021_0001$$$::I stop Saber since I feel like my life's in danger.[lr]::
37603::$$$message_0323_0021_0002$$$::Because as Saber turns to me...[lr]::
37604::$$$message_0323_0021_0003$$$::"What is it? You said that you wanted to train your readiness for battle, so I am only matching your enthusiasm."[lr]::
37605::$$$message_0323_0021_0004$$$::She's going to kill me.::
37606::$$$message_0323_0022_0000$$$::"Now, let us start our training, Shirou.[lr]::
37607::$$$message_0323_0022_0001$$$::First, I will knock the dullness out of your instincts. You've been slacking off. Brace yourself so that something like tonight will never happen again."[lr]::
37608::$$$message_0323_0022_0002$$$::So she [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] mad about dinner...!::
37609::$$$message_0323_0023_0000$$$::"W-what? That was Fuji-nee's fault![lr]::
37610::$$$message_0323_0023_0001$$$::A-and even though you complained, you ate all of it[line2]"::
37611::$$$message_0323_0024_0000$$$::"...There is no use in arguing.[lr]::
37612::$$$message_0323_0024_0001$$$::And, Shirou? Before you lose consciousness, let me make this clear: that was out of necessity. Please do not forget that."::
37613::$$$message_0323_0025_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
37614::$$$message_0323_0025_0001$$$::...Saber disappears.::
37615::$$$message_0323_0026_0000$$$::Oh man.[lr]::
37616::$$$message_0323_0026_0001$$$::So I have to go through four hours of brutal torture... Grudges over food sure are scary.::
