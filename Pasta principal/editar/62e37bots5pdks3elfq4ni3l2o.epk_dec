43025::$$$message_0380_0000_0000$$$::I jump down.::
43026::$$$message_0380_0001_0000$$$::I don't even bother using the stairs.::
43027::$$$message_0380_0002_0000$$$::I jumped down right behind Tohsaka from a height of five meters without knowing it.::
43028::$$$message_0380_0003_0000$$$::But that's it.[lr]::
43029::$$$message_0380_0003_0001$$$::My bamboo sword is crushed by Kuzuki's fist that tried to hit the back of Tohsaka's head. ::
43030::$$$message_0380_0004_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
43031::$$$message_0380_0004_0001$$$::Everyone opens their eyes wide in astonishment at the intruder.[lr]::
43032::$$$message_0380_0004_0002$$$::Except for one enemy, who reacts as if it's natural.::
43033::$$$message_0380_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43034::$$$message_0380_0005_0001$$$::There is no hesitation.[lr]::
43035::$$$message_0380_0005_0002$$$::It does not matter for this man who the opponent is.[lr]::
43036::$$$message_0380_0005_0003$$$::There are no emotions towards Shirou Emiya, who appeared out of nowhere.::
43037::$$$message_0380_0006_0000$$$::The grim reaper's nail is thrust.[lr]::
43038::$$$message_0380_0006_0001$$$::There's no way to avoid it.[lr]::
43039::$$$message_0380_0006_0002$$$::My neck will break like a stem.[lr]::
43040::$$$message_0380_0006_0003$$$::How unsightly.[lr]::
43041::$$$message_0380_0006_0004$$$::It's meaningless if I won't even last two seconds.[lr]::
43042::$$$message_0380_0006_0005$$$::Just like this... I...[lr]::
43043::$$$message_0380_0006_0006$$$::...won't be able to do anything, not even help Tohsaka...[lr]::
43044::$$$message_0380_0006_0007$$$::    [font italic=true]No.[font italic=false][lr]::
43045::$$$message_0380_0006_0008$$$::I've had a way out from the start.[lr]::
43046::$$$message_0380_0006_0009$$$::I can prepare numerous things to block the attack.[lr]::
43047::$$$message_0380_0006_0010$$$::If I am a mage...[lr]::
43048::$$$message_0380_0006_0011$$$::Then it is not my body that does battle, it is none other than my magecraft creations...! ::
43049::$$$message_0380_0007_0000$$$::"...Trace, on."[lr]::
43050::$$$message_0380_0007_0001$$$::Then make it.[lr]::
43051::$$$message_0380_0007_0002$$$::Success is a matter of course.[lr]::
43052::$$$message_0380_0007_0003$$$::Reconstruction doesn't start from the basic framework.[lr]::

43056::$$$message_0380_0007_0007$$$::That is why it is not reconstruction, but Projection. It is an equal shadow cast by the true object.::
43057::$$$message_0380_0008_0000$$$::                                                                           (Danger)[r]::
43058::$$$message_0380_0008_0001$$$::It does not matter how great the work is.[lr]::
43059::$$$message_0380_0008_0002$$$::If something has been accomplished once, there should be no problem recreating it...![lr]::

43061::$$$message_0380_0009_0000$$$::There is another problem.[lr]::
43062::$$$message_0380_0009_0001$$$::Yes, the problem is, the problem is the problem is, the problem is the problem is the problem is the body cannot keep up with the function. My body is burning.[lr]::
43063::$$$message_0380_0009_0002$$$::Every cell in me ignites. My nerves let out agonizing cries, my retinas crack and dry up, and my heartbeat disappears.[lr]::
43064::$$$message_0380_0009_0003$$$::I ignore my body's order to stop. I omit the process of the idea of creation, the basic framework, the quality of the composition materials, the technique necessary for creating, the experience of being depended on, the accumulated years in one breath, and create Kanshou and Bakuya.::
43065::$$$message_0380_0010_0000$$$::My whole body burns.[lr]::
43066::$$$message_0380_0010_0001$$$::To use Projection right now would mean to die.[lr]::
43067::$$$message_0380_0010_0002$$$::Shirou Emiya's body cannot bear such abnormal use of magecraft.[lr]::
43068::$$$message_0380_0010_0003$$$::My head ignores that and gets ahead of itself, and therefore, my body will perish.::
43069::$$$message_0380_0011_0000$$$::    But...[lr]::
43070::$$$message_0380_0011_0001$$$::There's no way that can be a problem.[lr]::
43071::$$$message_0380_0011_0002$$$::No, it can't be.::
43072::$$$message_0380_0012_0000$$$::    [font italic=true]I'll die if I create a sword?[font italic=false][lr]::
43073::$$$message_0380_0012_0001$$$::[font italic=true]No way.[font italic=false][lr]::
43074::$$$message_0380_0012_0002$$$::This body is a Magic Circuit specialized for that purpose alone.[lr]::
43075::$$$message_0380_0012_0003$$$::I've been helped by swords and have lived with swords.[lr]::
43076::$$$message_0380_0012_0004$$$::Therefore... I don't know about others, but there's no way I would self-destruct over something like creating a sword...!::
43077::$$$message_0380_0013_0000$$$::"Hah...!!"[lr]::
43078::$$$message_0380_0013_0001$$$::I repel it.[lr]::
43079::$$$message_0380_0013_0002$$$::The weapons in my hands are the same, and the enemy I'm confronting is the same.[lr]::
43080::$$$message_0380_0013_0003$$$::Kanshou and Bakuya are in my hands.[lr]::
43081::$$$message_0380_0013_0004$$$::The reproduced Archer's Noble Phantasm repels Kuzuki's fist once again.::
43082::$$$message_0380_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43083::$$$message_0380_0014_0001$$$::   It stopped.[lr]::
43084::$$$message_0380_0014_0002$$$::Kuzuki must've figured out that it would turn out the same as last time, as he slightly distances himself.::
43085::$$$message_0380_0015_0000$$$::"Haah, guh...!"[lr]::
43086::$$$message_0380_0015_0001$$$::My lung explodes.[lr]::
43087::$$$message_0380_0015_0002$$$::The breath I've been holding bursts out of my mouth.::
43088::$$$message_0380_0016_0000$$$::I can't feel my left shoulder.[lr]::
43089::$$$message_0380_0016_0001$$$::My wound has completely opened up, and the blood stains not only my bandage, but my clothes as well.::
43090::$$$message_0380_0017_0000$$$::   It's not from the damage of Projection.[lr]::
43091::$$$message_0380_0017_0001$$$::Two blows.[lr]::
43092::$$$message_0380_0017_0002$$$::My left arm is destroyed just from repelling Kuzuki's fist twice.[lr]::
43093::$$$message_0380_0017_0003$$$::If I received one more blow, I bet a strange scene would unfold where my shoulder bone dislocated and my arm flew off, even though I got punched by a fist.::
43094::$$$message_0380_0018_0000$$$::"...Haah, haah, haa..."[lr]::
43095::$$$message_0380_0018_0001$$$::I can't possibly reveal my internal conditions.[lr]::
43096::$$$message_0380_0018_0002$$$::I protect Tohsaka's back while readying my swords.::
43097::$$$message_0380_0019_0000$$$::But Tohsaka...[lr]::
43098::$$$message_0380_0019_0001$$$::"I-Idiot Shirou...! Why are you here...!?"[lr]::
43099::$$$message_0380_0019_0002$$$::...has stopped and is verbally attacking me.::
43100::$$$message_0380_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43101::$$$message_0380_0020_0001$$$::...I'm relieved.[lr]::
43102::$$$message_0380_0020_0002$$$::My choice wasn't wrong.[lr]::
43103::$$$message_0380_0020_0003$$$::I'm glad that her kindness that's hard to understand isn't gone.::
43104::$$$message_0380_0021_0000$$$::"...Ungh."[lr]::
43105::$$$message_0380_0021_0001$$$::No, now's not the time for that.[lr]::
43106::$$$message_0380_0021_0002$$$::It's too early to tell if my choice was right or not.[lr]::
43107::$$$message_0380_0021_0003$$$::We have to get out of here unwounded.::
43108::$$$message_0380_0022_0000$$$::"...Sorry, complain to me later, Tohsaka. I'll listen once I catch my breath, so let's do something about Archer and them right now."[lr]::
43109::$$$message_0380_0022_0001$$$::Tohsaka nods without a word and gets ready for battle.::
43110::$$$message_0380_0023_0000$$$::"...I knew you would interfere, but I did not think you would jump down."[lr]::
43111::$$$message_0380_0023_0001$$$::Kuzuki is watching us with his fists ready to fight.::
43112::$$$message_0380_0024_0000$$$::...He has no intention of letting us go.[lr]::
43113::$$$message_0380_0024_0001$$$::We are glaring at each other so that we don't let each other go.[lr]::
43114::$$$message_0380_0024_0002$$$::If either Tohsaka or I move, he should react right away...::
43115::$$$message_0380_0025_0000$$$::"Guh..."[lr]::
43116::$$$message_0380_0025_0001$$$::But I can't be leisurely standing by.[lr]::
43117::$$$message_0380_0025_0002$$$::...The wound on my shoulder is getting worse by the second.[lr]::
43118::$$$message_0380_0025_0003$$$::I'm losing concentration as I lose more blood.[lr]::
43119::$$$message_0380_0025_0004$$$::My body wasn't going to last long to start with.[lr]::
43120::$$$message_0380_0025_0005$$$::If we're going to run away, we have to run away as soon as possible.::
43121::$$$message_0380_0026_0000$$$::...But we can't run away that easily.[lr]::
43122::$$$message_0380_0026_0001$$$::If I move, Kuzuki will obviously react. If he does, Tohsaka will be the first one to be killed.[lr]::
43123::$$$message_0380_0026_0002$$$::I need to defeat Kuzuki to let Tohsaka get away. But I don't have the power to defeat Kuzuki, and Kuzuki isn't the only enemy.::
43124::$$$message_0380_0027_0000$$$::Behind Kuzuki is Caster and the traitor, Archer.[lr]::
43125::$$$message_0380_0027_0001$$$::...Well, worst comes to worst, Saber might also become our enemy.::
43126::$$$message_0380_0028_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43127::$$$message_0380_0028_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Was there no exit to start with?[font italic=false][lr]::
43128::$$$message_0380_0028_0002$$$::There's no miracle where we can escape this devastating situation.[lr]::
43129::$$$message_0380_0028_0003$$$::I would want Tohsaka to escape at the very least, but even that would require so much luck that it makes me disgusted...::
43130::$$$message_0380_0029_0000$$$::"That's it. I was surprised by the intrusion, but the outcome will not change.[lr]::
43131::$$$message_0380_0029_0001$$$::...Yes, it looks like you have given up too. You came out, so you do not mind dying, right, boy?"::
43132::$$$message_0380_0030_0000$$$::"I shall end it here for you. It would be troublesome to let you live, so..."[lr]::
43133::$$$message_0380_0030_0001$$$::"...!"[lr]::
43134::$$$message_0380_0030_0002$$$::...She's coming...![lr]::
43135::$$$message_0380_0030_0003$$$:: I can only resist with all my might at this point, so I stand in front of Tohsaka, putting strength into the twin swords.::
43136::$$$message_0380_0031_0000$$$::An intent to kill is released.[lr]::
43137::$$$message_0380_0031_0001$$$::Right before that reaches us...[lr]::
43138::$$$message_0380_0031_0002$$$::"...No. Wait, Caster."[lr]::
43139::$$$message_0380_0031_0003$$$::The red knight takes ahold of the atmosphere in an emotionless voice.::
43140::$$$message_0380_0032_0000$$$::"...Archer. I thought you knew that you do not have a right to say anything here."[lr]::
43141::$$$message_0380_0032_0001$$$::"Well, there was something I forgot to say. I would like to add just one condition to submit to you."[lr]::
43142::$$$message_0380_0032_0002$$$::"...A condition?"::
43143::$$$message_0380_0033_0000$$$::"Yeah. I offered my freedom to you without resistance.[lr]::
43144::$$$message_0380_0033_0001$$$::As compensation, let them go.[lr]::
43145::$$$message_0380_0033_0002$$$::In any case, they are useless as Masters. There is no merit in killing them."[lr]::
43146::$$$message_0380_0033_0003$$$::A suggestion as though it doesn't concern him.[lr]::
43147::$$$message_0380_0033_0004$$$::Tohsaka gazes at him intently.::
43148::$$$message_0380_0034_0000$$$::"Let them go? ...Heh. You are rather good-natured, despite your actions."[lr]::
43149::$$$message_0380_0034_0001$$$::"I was born as a human. It will leave a bad aftertaste if I kill my Master the moment I betrayed her."::
43150::$$$message_0380_0035_0000$$$::"Hmm. You are a traitor, yet that is bold of you to say such normal things in front of your Master."::
43151::$$$message_0380_0036_0000$$$::"...Fine. I shall let them go this time. But I will kill them the next time they do such an annoying thing, no matter who tries to stop me.[lr]::
43152::$$$message_0380_0036_0001$$$::Is that fine, Archer?"::
43153::$$$message_0380_0037_0000$$$::"Of course. If they are foolish enough to challenge us to fight in such a situation, they should die right away."::
43154::$$$message_0380_0038_0000$$$::...That must have concluded the negotiation.[lr]::
43155::$$$message_0380_0038_0001$$$::The killing intent that filled the sanctuary fades, and the tension to not let us go disappears.::
43156::$$$message_0380_0039_0000$$$::"So that is it, you two. I shall let you go this time.[lr]::
43157::$$$message_0380_0039_0001$$$::Now, run like the losers you are."[lr]::
43158::$$$message_0380_0039_0002$$$::"Khh..."[lr]::
43159::$$$message_0380_0039_0003$$$::I glare at Caster.[lr]::
43160::$$$message_0380_0039_0004$$$::...But...[lr]::
43161::$$$message_0380_0039_0005$$$::Tohsaka silently pulls my arm.::
43162::$$$message_0380_0040_0000$$$::"Let's go. She's right."[lr]::
43163::$$$message_0380_0040_0001$$$::She whispers in my ear.[lr]::
43164::$$$message_0380_0040_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43165::$$$message_0380_0040_0003$$$::I calm my breathing and turn my back to the enemy in front of me.::
43166::$$$message_0380_0041_0000$$$::We slowly walk to the stairs, without even running.[lr]::
43167::$$$message_0380_0041_0001$$$::The distance that seemed so great is covered in just a few steps.[lr]::
43168::$$$message_0380_0041_0002$$$::A footstep.[lr]::
43169::$$$message_0380_0041_0003$$$::Tohsaka puts a foot on the stairs and looks back at Caster once.[lr]::
43170::$$$message_0380_0041_0004$$$::...No, that's not it.[lr]::
43171::$$$message_0380_0041_0005$$$::The one she looked back at was not Caster, but that man smiling beside our enemy.::
43172::$$$message_0380_0042_0000$$$::"Resenting me would be barking up the wrong tree, Rin.[lr]::
43173::$$$message_0380_0042_0001$$$::It is just that this woman is superior as a Master.[lr]::
43174::$$$message_0380_0042_0002$$$::Once the comparison is clear, I choose the stronger one."::
43175::$$$message_0380_0043_0000$$$::"...You're right. But you'll regret it. I will never give up.[lr]::
43176::$$$message_0380_0043_0001$$$::You see, I'll defeat Caster and get you back. I won't forgive you even if you apologize then."::
43177::$$$message_0380_0044_0000$$$::"Your efforts will be in vain. Well, I will not stop you if you want to throw away your life."[lr]::
43178::$$$message_0380_0044_0001$$$::She turns away and starts walking.[lr]::
43179::$$$message_0380_0044_0002$$$::Looking at her side profile, she's biting her lip vexingly.[lr]::
43180::$$$message_0380_0044_0003$$$::Yet she doesn't speed up and leaves the underground sanctuary with confident steps and without looking back.::
43181::$$$message_0380_0045_0000$$$::We get out of the church.[lr]::
43182::$$$message_0380_0045_0001$$$::We didn't exchange words at all from the underground sanctuary to here.þÙèÝ
