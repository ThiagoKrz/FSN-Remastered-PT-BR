14305::$$$message_0136_0000_0000$$$::By the time the sun sets, the rain's stopped completely.[lr]::
14306::$$$message_0136_0000_0001$$$::Based on our conversation during breakfast, we're heading to town to look for the other Master...::
14307::$$$message_0136_0001_0000$$$::"But I should check something beforehand..."[lr]::
14308::$$$message_0136_0001_0001$$$::I should check Saber's intentions.[lr]::
14309::$$$message_0136_0001_0002$$$::What is her purpose in fighting?::
14310::$$$message_0136_0002_0000$$$::"But I shouldn't just ask her straight out. I'll need to be casual about it."[lr]::
14311::$$$message_0136_0002_0001$$$::I hype myself up a bit, then push to my feet.[lr]::
14312::$$$message_0136_0002_0002$$$::The living room seems like a good starting place.[lr]::
14313::$$$message_0136_0002_0003$$$::I'm going to leverage the peaceful pre-dinner mood to try to get through Saber's stubborn nature.::
14314::$$$message_0136_0003_0000$$$::"What if, hypothetically...[lr]::
14315::$$$message_0136_0003_0001$$$::What would we do if we won the Holy Grail War?"[lr]::
14316::$$$message_0136_0003_0002$$$::So much for casual.[lr]::
14317::$$$message_0136_0003_0003$$$::I thought about it a lot and couldn't come up with anything smooth, so blunt it is.::
14318::$$$message_0136_0004_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
14319::$$$message_0136_0004_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
14320::$$$message_0136_0004_0002$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
14321::$$$message_0136_0004_0003$$$::All three of them offer more or less the same response, though with slightly different expressions.::
14322::$$$message_0136_0005_0000$$$::"Like I said, after we win. I want to talk about what to do once we obtain the Holy Grail."::
14323::$$$message_0136_0006_0000$$$::"Yeah, we got that, thanks... Where did this come from?"::
14324::$$$message_0136_0007_0000$$$::Saber and Illya don't nod, but they do seem to share an opinion on the subject.[lr]::
14325::$$$message_0136_0007_0001$$$::I guess this was kind of weird to bring up out of nowhere.[lr]::
14326::$$$message_0136_0007_0002$$$::But I have to play dumb for now.::
14327::$$$message_0136_0008_0000$$$::"Yeah. Well, I'm just asking.[lr]::
14328::$$$message_0136_0008_0001$$$::There are only three Servants left, so it's not such an unrealistic thought. So, you know, the end is kind of in sight."::
14329::$$$message_0136_0009_0000$$$::"Hmmm. Well, you might be right.[lr]::
14330::$$$message_0136_0009_0001$$$::I guess even Shirou could be thinking about that by now. You did join the war, so I guess it's no surprise you've got your mind on the reward now that you've been risking your life for this."::
14331::$$$message_0136_0010_0000$$$::"Y-yeah. I WOULD think that."[lr]::
14332::$$$message_0136_0010_0001$$$::I'm glad Tohsaka likes to focus on the reason for things.[lr]::
14333::$$$message_0136_0010_0002$$$::Tohsaka will allow for the possibility of anything that seems logical, which is really one of her better qualities.[lr]::
14334::$$$message_0136_0010_0003$$$::This is just something I brought up to discuss though.::
14335::$$$message_0136_0011_0000$$$::"So what about you, Tohsaka? What would you do if you got the Holy Grail?"[lr]::
14336::$$$message_0136_0011_0001$$$::I try to be as natural as possible with this.::
14337::$$$message_0136_0012_0000$$$::"Let's see...I've really only ever thought about winning. There's nothing I want to wish for from the Holy Grail.[lr]::
14338::$$$message_0136_0012_0001$$$::I'd take the Holy Grail, but I've never thought about what I'd do with it."::
14339::$$$message_0136_0013_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14340::$$$message_0136_0013_0001$$$::So she's fighting because she doesn't want to lose.[lr]::
14341::$$$message_0136_0013_0002$$$::I figured that was the case, but didn't know for sure until she said it herself.::
14342::$$$message_0136_0014_0000$$$::"I don't believe this. You seemed like the one person who would have had it all worked out, but you've actually thought about it the least."[lr]::
14343::$$$message_0136_0014_0001$$$::"Hmph. Say what you want. What about you then, Illyasviel?"::
14344::$$$message_0136_0015_0000$$$::"I don't know. I was just told not to give up the Holy Grail to anyone because it's mine.[lr]::
14345::$$$message_0136_0015_0001$$$::It's mine to begin with, so I obviously don't care."::
14346::$$$message_0136_0016_0000$$$::"Is that so? So you're saying you enjoy the Holy Grail War more than the Holy Grail?"[lr]::
14347::$$$message_0136_0016_0001$$$::"Of course. I only came here to win. I don't care what it gets used for."::
14348::$$$message_0136_0017_0000$$$::They're two peas in a pod.[lr]::
14349::$$$message_0136_0017_0001$$$::The two stare at each other in silence. They seem to be coming to some sort of understanding.::
14350::$$$message_0136_0018_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
14351::$$$message_0136_0018_0001$$$::Saber doesn't say anything.[lr]::
14352::$$$message_0136_0018_0002$$$::She probably doesn't intend to join the conversation.[lr]::
14353::$$$message_0136_0018_0003$$$::No matter how much she resists, I still have to ask.::
14354::$$$message_0136_0019_0000$$$::"I have a good idea of your goals."[lr]::
14355::$$$message_0136_0019_0001$$$::I try to turn as naturally as possible.[lr]::
14356::$$$message_0136_0019_0002$$$::"So what about you, Saber?"[lr]::
14357::$$$message_0136_0019_0003$$$::She's been quiet this whole time.::
14358::$$$message_0136_0020_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
14359::$$$message_0136_0020_0001$$$::Saber doesn't reply.[lr]::
14360::$$$message_0136_0020_0002$$$::Sensing that something's amiss, Tohsaka and Illya stop and turn towards Saber.[lr]::
14361::$$$message_0136_0020_0003$$$::The silence stretches out for maybe a minute.::
14362::$$$message_0136_0021_0000$$$::"I need not remind any of you of this, but it is my duty to obtain the Holy Grail.[lr]::
14363::$$$message_0136_0021_0001$$$::I know little of the Holy Grail's potential...[lr]::
14364::$$$message_0136_0021_0002$$$::...but so long as it [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] a Holy Grail, I must obtain it.[lr]::
14365::$$$message_0136_0021_0003$$$::And, if it is possible, I will have my wish granted."::
14366::$$$message_0136_0022_0000$$$::There it is.[lr]::
14367::$$$message_0136_0022_0001$$$::Saber's just said she has a wish of her own!::
14368::$$$message_0136_0023_0000$$$::"I see. So what is your wish?"[lr]::
14369::$$$message_0136_0023_0001$$$::I try to calm my racing heart and keep composed as I ask.[lr]::
14370::$$$message_0136_0023_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14371::$$$message_0136_0023_0003$$$::Saber doesn't answer.::
14372::$$$message_0136_0024_0000$$$::Fine. That's fine.[lr]::
14373::$$$message_0136_0024_0001$$$::If she can't answer, chances are good it's because her wish is a selfish one.::
14374::$$$message_0136_0025_0000$$$::Knowing Saber, she may hesitate to reveal her wish to anyone if she's wishing for something selfish.[lr]::
14375::$$$message_0136_0025_0001$$$::And I think I'd rather she keep quiet than make something up.[lr]::
14376::$$$message_0136_0025_0002$$$::I can feel myself trying to back away from the question I raised.::
14377::$$$message_0136_0026_0000$$$::"Is it really that complicated?[lr]::
14378::$$$message_0136_0026_0001$$$::Grandfather said the Servants want to come back to life in this world. They want the Holy Grail for a second chance at life. Isn't that the case with you, Saber?"::
14379::$$$message_0136_0027_0000$$$::Saber jerks her head up.[lr]::
14380::$$$message_0136_0027_0001$$$::If that's what she wanted, there would be no problem.[lr]::
14381::$$$message_0136_0027_0002$$$::Which means...::
14382::$$$message_0136_0028_0000$$$::"No. I have no interest in a second life.[lr]::
14383::$$$message_0136_0028_0001$$$::My only goal is to obtain the Holy Grail.[lr]::
14384::$$$message_0136_0028_0002$$$::The price I paid to have a chance at obtaining the Holy Grail was becoming a Servant."::
14385::$$$message_0136_0029_0000$$$::I figured that much.[lr]::
14386::$$$message_0136_0029_0001$$$::Someone who took an oath and drew the sacred sword wouldn't seek a second life.::
14387::$$$message_0136_0030_0000$$$::"Hold on. You became a Servant just to obtain the Holy Grail? You formed a contract when you become a Heroic Spirit?"::
14388::$$$message_0136_0031_0000$$$::"Yes. I asked to seek the Holy Grail in exchange for becoming a Servant."::
14389::$$$message_0136_0032_0000$$$::"What!?[lr]::
14390::$$$message_0136_0032_0001$$$::Are you saying you weren't summoned as a Servant to help a Master get the Holy Grail, but you [font italic=true]chose[font italic=false] to become a Servant so you can get the Grail yourself!?"::
14391::$$$message_0136_0033_0000$$$::Tohsaka stares at Saber.[lr]::
14392::$$$message_0136_0033_0001$$$::She tilts her head, confused.::
14393::$$$message_0136_0034_0000$$$::"So Saber wasn't summoned because she's a Heroic Spirit, but because she just volunteered to join the war?"::
14394::$$$message_0136_0035_0000$$$::"But as long as she's a Servant, she's supposed to be a reputable Heroic Spirit... That would mean she can't affect the world herself... So Saber must have gone around the rules for Servants... Which she obviously hasn't...[lr]::
14395::$$$message_0136_0035_0001$$$::Argh. Hold on a minute. I need to organize my thoughts."::
14396::$$$message_0136_0036_0000$$$::"No. You need do nothing of the sort. You were correct, Rin.[lr]::
14397::$$$message_0136_0036_0001$$$::I am different than the other Servants.[lr]::
14398::$$$message_0136_0036_0002$$$::I have yet to become a complete Servant."::
14399::$$$message_0136_0037_0000$$$::"Not a complete Servant...?"[lr]::
14400::$$$message_0136_0037_0001$$$::What does that mean?[lr]::
14401::$$$message_0136_0037_0002$$$::Well first of all, what does it mean to become a Servant?::
14402::$$$message_0136_0038_0000$$$::Saber just said...[lr]::
14403::$$$message_0136_0038_0001$$$::She agreed to become a Servant as the price she had to pay to obtain the Holy Grail.[lr]::
14404::$$$message_0136_0038_0002$$$::Which means...::
14405::$$$message_0136_0039_0000$$$::"Hold on a minute.[lr]::
14406::$$$message_0136_0039_0001$$$::Are Servants forced to fight as the price to get what they want?"::
14407::$$$message_0136_0040_0000$$$::"No, that is incorrect. Servants are special familiars that exist only for the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
14408::$$$message_0136_0040_0001$$$::A Servant is created through special summoning magecraft which employs the characteristics of Heroic Spirits.[lr]::
14409::$$$message_0136_0040_0002$$$::They are already Heroic Spirits, so there are no rules which say that Servants must work because they are given something."::
14410::$$$message_0136_0041_0000$$$::"Right. The Servant system uses Heroic Spirits, which are Guardian incarnations.[lr]::
14411::$$$message_0136_0041_0001$$$::It's working with something that already exists, so neither Servants nor Masters have to pay a price to use this system."::
14412::$$$message_0136_0042_0000$$$::"But I have heard that before becoming a Servant...they have to pay a price to become a Heroic Spirit in the first place.[lr]::
14413::$$$message_0136_0042_0001$$$::Heroic Spirits are Guardians for humans.[lr]::
14414::$$$message_0136_0042_0002$$$::Even after their deaths, they work to protect humanity and prevent the destruction of the human world."::
14415::$$$message_0136_0043_0000$$$::"And in order to become a Guardian, the person must, while they are still active as a hero in their lifetime, make a deal of some kind.[lr]::
14416::$$$message_0136_0043_0001$$$::That's the contract to become a Heroic Spirit...a ritual to give themselves to the world after they die."::
14417::$$$message_0136_0044_0000$$$::"The beneficiaries of this exchange become heroes, and after they've done what they wanted to do as a hero and eventually died, they repay that debt by becoming Heroic Spirits.[lr]::
14418::$$$message_0136_0044_0001$$$::Basically, in order to become a hero in life, they go into a sort of debt, which they then repay as a Heroic Spirit after death.[lr]::
14419::$$$message_0136_0044_0002$$$::Masters like us use Servants because we swoop in and make use of that debt Heroic Spirits are trying to repay."::
14420::$$$message_0136_0045_0000$$$::"Hm. So you're saying humans become heroes by making some sort of trade, and in return, they get used and summoned as Heroic Spirit familiars after their death.[lr]::
14421::$$$message_0136_0045_0001$$$::Which means the deal Saber made to become a Heroic Spirit was for..."::
14422::$$$message_0136_0046_0000$$$::The Holy Grail.[lr]::
14423::$$$message_0136_0046_0001$$$::Since Saber obtained the Holy Grail in her lifetime, the price she has to pay is serving as a Heroic Spirit, a sort of Guardian, even after death?::
14424::$$$message_0136_0047_0000$$$::"That doesn't sound right. Saber said that her goal was the Holy Grail. But she already obtained it, since she became a hero in exchange for the Holy Grail."::
14425::$$$message_0136_0048_0000$$$::"That is not correct, Shirou. I have not yet obtained the Holy Grail.[lr]::
14426::$$$message_0136_0048_0001$$$::Altria...King Arthur's wish was to obtain the Holy Grail during their lifetime.[lr]::
14427::$$$message_0136_0048_0002$$$::I had to obtain the Holy Grail [font italic=true]before[font italic=false] I died.[lr]::
14428::$$$message_0136_0048_0003$$$::That is why I agreed to become a Guardian after I died if I could first obtain the Holy Grail."::
14429::$$$message_0136_0049_0000$$$::"As Rin explained, humans form contracts with the world to become heroes. In exchange, they receive powers beyond human ability, which they pay for by serving after death.[lr]::
14430::$$$message_0136_0049_0001$$$::But I did not require the world's help to become a hero. Fortunately, King Arthur required no such aid."::
14431::$$$message_0136_0050_0000$$$::...She didn't need any help to become a hero.[lr]::
14432::$$$message_0136_0050_0001$$$::So Saber became a hero on her own.::
14433::$$$message_0136_0051_0000$$$::"Hm. Yet you are here as a Heroic Spirit.[lr]::
14434::$$$message_0136_0051_0001$$$::Does that mean you asked for something else from the world [font italic=true]after[font italic=false] King Arthur became a hero?"::
14435::$$$message_0136_0052_0000$$$::"Yes. I required the Holy Grail in my final moments. A wish that must be granted presented itself, so I [font italic=true]needed[font italic=false] the Holy Grail.[lr]::
14436::$$$message_0136_0052_0001$$$::That is why...I formed a Heroic Spirit contract.[lr]::
14437::$$$message_0136_0052_0002$$$::I offered to wield my sword as a Heroic Spirit after my death...so long as I could lay hands upon the Holy Grail."::
14438::$$$message_0136_0053_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14439::$$$message_0136_0053_0001$$$::In her last moments, she wished for the Holy Grail's miracle.[lr]::
14440::$$$message_0136_0053_0002$$$::Now I understand her feelings.[lr]::
14441::$$$message_0136_0053_0003$$$::The blood-soaked hill.[lr]::
14442::$$$message_0136_0053_0004$$$::Swords standing as gravestones, the bodies of so many knights.[lr]::
14443::$$$message_0136_0053_0005$$$::A lone king whose reign ended in betrayal.[lr]::
14444::$$$message_0136_0053_0006$$$::She didn't deserve the end she met.[lr]::
14445::$$$message_0136_0053_0007$$$::Even if she hadn't had a wish of her own before, she must have thought...::
14446::$$$message_0136_0054_0000$$$::I can't die here.[lr]::
14447::$$$message_0136_0054_0001$$$::This isn't the end I want.[lr]::
14448::$$$message_0136_0054_0002$$$::And that's why...there is no shame in using the power of the Holy Grail to prolong her life.::
14449::$$$message_0136_0055_0000$$$::"I see. So you seized the means of obtaining the Holy Grail by selling yourself after death.[lr]::
14450::$$$message_0136_0055_0001$$$::But Saber, your condition was obtaining the Holy Grail while you were still alive, right?[lr]::
14451::$$$message_0136_0055_0002$$$::Then...::
14452::$$$message_0136_0056_0000$$$::"Yes, I could not complete my search for the Holy Grail while I was alive. I, King Arthur, could not obtain the Holy Grail even at the very end.[lr]::
14453::$$$message_0136_0056_0001$$$::But that would nullify my contract.[lr]::
14454::$$$message_0136_0056_0002$$$::For the world to make a Servant of me, it must provide a Holy Grail while King Arthur yet lives.[lr]::
14455::$$$message_0136_0056_0003$$$::And that is why..."::
14456::$$$message_0136_0057_0000$$$::"King Arthur will not die until she obtains the Holy Grail. That is to say, she can't die.[lr]::
14457::$$$message_0136_0057_0001$$$::That means you're..."::
14458::$$$message_0136_0058_0000$$$::"Yes. Time for King Arthur...for me...stopped at the moment of my death.[lr]::
14459::$$$message_0136_0058_0001$$$::I should have died a long time ago, but that does not fulfill the contract.[lr]::
14460::$$$message_0136_0058_0002$$$::King Arthur was summoned as a Servant right at the moment of death, and she will die the moment she obtains the Holy Grail."::
14461::$$$message_0136_0059_0000$$$::"So it's not that time's stopped. You're just stuck in time.[lr]::
14462::$$$message_0136_0059_0001$$$::It doesn't matter how many times you repeat your fight as a Servant, because you obtaining the Holy Grail and fulfilling your contract is predetermined..."::
14463::$$$message_0136_0060_0000$$$::"That is correct. I will one day obtain the Holy Grail, and my contract will be fulfilled. That is why I can be summoned as a Heroic Spirit in another age: the outcome of my arrangement has already been determined.::
14464::$$$message_0136_0061_0000$$$::"This does not apply only to the Holy Grail in this town.[lr]::
14465::$$$message_0136_0061_0001$$$::Should there be a chance of obtaining the Holy Grail, I could be summoned to any battlefield.[lr]::
14466::$$$message_0136_0061_0002$$$::One day, I will obtain the Holy Grail, and once my wish has been granted, time[line2]stopped for me at the moment of death[line2]will resume its flow.[lr]::
14467::$$$message_0136_0061_0003$$$::King Arthur will meet her end, and in exchange for obtaining the Holy Grail, she will become a Heroic Spirit."::
14468::$$$message_0136_0062_0000$$$::"So, for you, it's like a dream just before dying...one you can't wake from.[lr]::
14469::$$$message_0136_0062_0001$$$::This Holy Grail War is just a part of that dream.[lr]::
14470::$$$message_0136_0062_0002$$$::And the only way for you to wake is to get a Holy Grail.::
14471::$$$message_0136_0063_0000$$$::"You believed I could not enter spirit form because Shirou is inexperienced, but that is incorrect. I cannot enter spirit form because I am still alive.[lr]::
14472::$$$message_0136_0063_0001$$$::It may only be a technicality, but I am considered a living person.[lr]::
14473::$$$message_0136_0063_0002$$$::...Just like during the last Holy Grail War."::
14474::$$$message_0136_0064_0000$$$::Saber's tone is apologetic.[lr]::
14475::$$$message_0136_0064_0001$$$::She probably feels bad for laying the blame for her not being able to enter spirit form on my ineptitude.[lr]::
14476::$$$message_0136_0064_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14477::$$$message_0136_0064_0003$$$::I don't care about that.[lr]::
14478::$$$message_0136_0064_0004$$$::But there's something I need to ask.::
14479::$$$message_0136_0065_0000$$$::"Saber. What do you mean you're not dead? I got that you won't die until you obtain the Holy Grail.[lr]::
14480::$$$message_0136_0065_0001$$$::...And based on how you described it, you haven't been alive since the time of King Arthur.[lr]::
14481::$$$message_0136_0065_0002$$$::But then...who are you right now?[lr]::
14482::$$$message_0136_0065_0003$$$::You're not a clone of the real person or anything...right?"::
14483::$$$message_0136_0066_0000$$$::"That is correct. Heroic Spirits, when summoned, are like copies of a person's original body, but I have yet to reach that state.[lr]::
14484::$$$message_0136_0066_0001$$$::Until I obtain a Holy Grail, I appear as I am at the moment of my death."::
14485::$$$message_0136_0067_0000$$$::"As Rin mentioned, King Arthur is now stopped in the great river of time.[lr]::
14486::$$$message_0136_0067_0001$$$::From where I am stranded, I jump both forward and back along the river's flow, and after I attempt to obtain the Holy Grail, I return to where time stopped for me."::
14487::$$$message_0136_0068_0000$$$::I try to diagram it all in my head.[lr]::
14488::$$$message_0136_0068_0001$$$::It's pretty simple once I visualize it. [lr]::
14489::$$$message_0136_0068_0002$$$::King Arthur is stopped in time at the moment before she dies.[lr]::
14490::$$$message_0136_0068_0003$$$::But that doesn't matter to the wider flow of time.[lr]::
14491::$$$message_0136_0068_0004$$$::It continues on, all the way to the present.::
14492::$$$message_0136_0069_0000$$$::She jumps to whatever time she's needed, then returns to her own frozen moment in time after she completes her duty.::
14493::$$$message_0136_0070_0000$$$::If she manages to obtain the Holy Grail in one of the times she visits, she'll be swept back into the proper flow of time and die, just as she does in the history we know.::
14494::$$$message_0136_0071_0000$$$::Maybe that's how Heroic Spirits work.[lr]::
14495::$$$message_0136_0071_0001$$$::When they die, they're transferred back to a sort of nexus where the flow of time stops.::
14496::$$$message_0136_0072_0000$$$::And then when they're summoned, they are taken to that point in time, then disappear without ever returning.[lr]::
14497::$$$message_0136_0072_0001$$$::That's probably what is meant by Heroic Spirits being doubles.::
14498::$$$message_0136_0073_0000$$$::Kind of like a clone made from their original cells.[lr]::
14499::$$$message_0136_0073_0001$$$::The Heroic Spirit, which completely retains the abilities and memories they had while alive, appears in this world and gains more knowledge. But it's all useless.::
14500::$$$message_0136_0074_0000$$$::They have no means to return to their original body, and instead just disappear.[lr]::
14501::$$$message_0136_0074_0001$$$::And so, no matter how many times or in how many different eras they're summoned, there will never be any inconsistencies in the Heroic Spirit's memories.::
14502::$$$message_0136_0075_0000$$$::From the moment the person becomes a Heroic Spirit, they will never change.[lr]::
14503::$$$message_0136_0075_0001$$$::Even if they obtain new knowledge, they will just disappear once their role is over.::
14504::$$$message_0136_0076_0000$$$::So in that sense, Saber is not a complete Servant.[lr]::
14505::$$$message_0136_0076_0001$$$::After each time she's summoned, she eventually returns to her own time.[lr]::
14506::$$$message_0136_0076_0002$$$::She goes back to that moment where she's about to die on that blood-soaked hill.::
14507::$$$message_0136_0077_0000$$$::"Hold it.[lr]::
14508::$$$message_0136_0077_0001$$$::So then what? If you manage to get the Holy Grail this time, you'll return to your own time and use the Holy Grail there!?[lr]::
14509::$$$message_0136_0077_0002$$$::That's altering the past! Time traveling or intervening in a parallel world is Magic! You can't do something like that."::
14510::$$$message_0136_0078_0000$$$::"But the Holy Grail makes that possible."[lr]::
14511::$$$message_0136_0078_0001$$$::My contract dictates that I will become a Servant if I can use the Holy Grail.[lr]::
14512::$$$message_0136_0078_0002$$$::Even if using the Holy Grail causes the [font italic=true]person[font italic=false] Altria to disappear, that is simply cost of me becoming a Heroic Spirit."::
14513::$$$message_0136_0079_0000$$$::Saber is so matter-of-fact about it.[lr]::
14514::$$$message_0136_0079_0001$$$::It doesn't sound right though.[lr]::
14515::$$$message_0136_0079_0002$$$::Using the Holy Grail to grant a wish is fine.[lr]::
14516::$$$message_0136_0079_0003$$$::But why would that mean Altria has to disappear?::
14517::$$$message_0136_0080_0000$$$::"What the hell? Altria's going to disappear by using the Holy Grail? That's messed up.[lr]::
14518::$$$message_0136_0080_0001$$$::Saber. You're not going to..."[lr]::
14519::$$$message_0136_0080_0002$$$::I see the image of the girl dying on that hill all alone.[lr]::
14520::$$$message_0136_0080_0003$$$::"You're not going to use the Holy Grail to save yourself?"::
14521::$$$message_0136_0081_0000$$$::"Hm? What are you asking, Shirou?[lr]::
14522::$$$message_0136_0081_0001$$$::My only desire is to save my nation from ruin."::
14523::$$$message_0136_0082_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
14524::$$$message_0136_0082_0001$$$::I can feel my expression tensing up.[lr]::
14525::$$$message_0136_0082_0002$$$::I thought I knew Saber's wish...but now my head is spinning, and I feel like throwing up.[lr]::
14526::$$$message_0136_0082_0003$$$::"Wh...y?"[lr]::
14527::$$$message_0136_0082_0004$$$::And yet...[lr]::
14528::$$$message_0136_0082_0005$$$::I try to push air from my lungs and get that one word out.::
14529::$$$message_0136_0083_0000$$$::"There is no reason I should not.[lr]::
14530::$$$message_0136_0083_0001$$$::I could not protect my nation. I became king to protect the nation, but I failed to fulfill that duty.[lr]::
14531::$$$message_0136_0083_0002$$$::And that is when I thought...[lr]::
14532::$$$message_0136_0083_0003$$$::Perhaps the sword in the stone was wrong to have chosen me."::
14533::$$$message_0136_0084_0000$$$::"Tha[line2]"[lr]::
14534::$$$message_0136_0084_0001$$$::That's ridiculous.[lr]::
14535::$$$message_0136_0084_0002$$$::Why would she think that!?::
14536::$$$message_0136_0085_0000$$$::"No, that is a doubt I always carried with me.[lr]::
14537::$$$message_0136_0085_0001$$$::Perhaps I was never fit to be king.[lr]::
14538::$$$message_0136_0085_0002$$$::Perhaps there was another hero who would have been a better choice.[lr]::
14539::$$$message_0136_0085_0003$$$::Even in the moment I pulled the sword, there must have been a better king out there, one able to save the nation, while I could not.[lr]::
14540::$$$message_0136_0085_0004$$$::And so, if I could use the power of the Holy Grail to redo the selection of the king...then perhaps we could..."::
14541::$$$message_0136_0086_0000$$$::Is she saying that...[lr]::
14542::$$$message_0136_0086_0001$$$::Her nation wouldn't be destroyed if she was able to go back to that moment?::
14543::$$$message_0136_0087_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14544::$$$message_0136_0087_0001$$$::I feel faint.[lr]::
14545::$$$message_0136_0087_0002$$$::I'm really angry at Saber for wishing for such a ridiculous thing? The feeling passes in an instant though.::
14546::$$$message_0136_0088_0000$$$::I probably look like a deer in headlights.[lr]::
14547::$$$message_0136_0088_0001$$$::Isn't it obvious?[lr]::
14548::$$$message_0136_0088_0002$$$::Saber's wish is not for herself. And on top of that, she wishes for her own elimination.::
14549::$$$message_0136_0089_0000$$$::She exists because she became king by drawing the sacred sword.[lr]::
14550::$$$message_0136_0089_0001$$$::To pretend that never happened means she simply wouldn't exist.::
14551::$$$message_0136_0090_0000$$$::Let's say we use the Holy Grail to grant her wish.[lr]::
14552::$$$message_0136_0090_0001$$$::Altria would never become king. She would just live in a timeline where she is an ordinary knight.[lr]::
14553::$$$message_0136_0090_0002$$$::But then what would happen to the Saber I know?[lr]::
14554::$$$message_0136_0090_0003$$$::Even if it's only temporary, she already exists as a Heroic Spirit. And if her wish is granted, she will continue on, but as a being meant only for fighting.::
14555::$$$message_0136_0091_0000$$$::She's already paid the price for obtaining the Holy Grail...so the Saber I know will continue existing, even if Altria never becomes king.[lr]::
14556::$$$message_0136_0091_0001$$$::She will be cut off from the past and future.[lr]::
14557::$$$message_0136_0091_0002$$$::She will always and only ever be the lonely knight dying on that blood-soaked hill.::
14558::$$$message_0136_0092_0000$$$::"That's idiotic."[lr]::
14559::$$$message_0136_0092_0001$$$::I won't allow it.[lr]::
14560::$$$message_0136_0092_0002$$$::There is no hope of salvation there.[lr]::
14561::$$$message_0136_0092_0003$$$::Even if she was able to do it all over, and there really was a better king, and her nation did manage to last longer, and if she was herself saved...::
14562::$$$message_0136_0093_0000$$$::It'd all be lies.[lr]::
14563::$$$message_0136_0093_0001$$$::Even if it made everyone around her happy, I can't just let the past ten years she fought through be a lie.::
14564::$$$message_0136_0094_0000$$$::"No. You can't do that.[lr]::
14565::$$$message_0136_0094_0001$$$::You can't redo things. It wouldn't mean anything if you did, Saber."::
14566::$$$message_0136_0095_0000$$$::"...Shirou?"[lr]::
14567::$$$message_0136_0095_0001$$$::"Don't use the Holy Grail for something like that.[lr]::
14568::$$$message_0136_0095_0002$$$::You obtain the Holy Grail because [font italic=true]you[font italic=false] fight for it. You should use that miracle for yourself."::
14569::$$$message_0136_0096_0000$$$::"Wha... But I have said... I will be using it for myself.[lr]::
14570::$$$message_0136_0096_0001$$$::I... Altria, must fulfill her duty as king."[lr]::
14571::$$$message_0136_0096_0002$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
14572::$$$message_0136_0096_0003$$$::How does she not understand!?::
14573::$$$message_0136_0097_0000$$$::"You've already done more than your duty! You've done so much already. You didn't give up even when you were feared, or even when you were betrayed! You held on to your sword until the end on that hill.[lr]::
14574::$$$message_0136_0097_0001$$$::So why...why do you have to keep such promises even after you die!?"::
14575::$$$message_0136_0098_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14576::$$$message_0136_0098_0001$$$::Saber looks bewildered.[lr]::
14577::$$$message_0136_0098_0002$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
14578::$$$message_0136_0098_0003$$$::Too late to regret what I said.[lr]::
14579::$$$message_0136_0098_0004$$$::I shouldn't have just blurted out that I've been dreaming of Saber's past.::
14580::$$$message_0136_0099_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14581::$$$message_0136_0099_0001$$$::A heavy silence hangs between us.[lr]::
14582::$$$message_0136_0099_0002$$$::I can't think what to say.[lr]::
14583::$$$message_0136_0099_0003$$$::Even I can tell speaking up will just make things worse right now.[lr]::
14584::$$$message_0136_0099_0004$$$::But...I just can't keep quiet.::
14585::$$$message_0136_0100_0000$$$::"Saber...I don't like it when people aren't rewarded for their hard work."[lr]::
14586::$$$message_0136_0100_0001$$$::It's wrong. It's not fair.[lr]::
14587::$$$message_0136_0100_0002$$$::I get that it's childish, but I want to believe that humans can find happiness if they really work for it.::
14588::$$$message_0136_0101_0000$$$::"I'm not going to lose to the other Masters.[lr]::
14589::$$$message_0136_0101_0001$$$::I'm claiming the Holy Grail, no question.[lr]::
14590::$$$message_0136_0101_0002$$$::...That's why I want you to make your own wish.[lr]::
14591::$$$message_0136_0101_0003$$$::That way, I'll actually find some meaning in this stupid war."::
14592::$$$message_0136_0102_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14593::$$$message_0136_0102_0001$$$::That's the conclusion I reached.[lr]::
14594::$$$message_0136_0102_0002$$$::I don't know what the Holy Grail is, nor do I know if it's even something you [font italic=true]should[font italic=false] try to obtain.[lr]::
14595::$$$message_0136_0102_0003$$$::But...if it could save Saber, even a little, then I'll go all out for her.::
14596::$$$message_0136_0103_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
14597::$$$message_0136_0103_0001$$$::The sound of heavy bells rings out and the house suddenly goes dark.::
14598::$$$message_0136_0104_0000$$$::The air changes immediately.[lr]::
14599::$$$message_0136_0104_0001$$$::The lights go out, but Saber, Tohsaka, and I don't say a word. We try to gauge our surroundings with our other senses.::
14600::$$$message_0136_0105_0000$$$::The loud ringing stops and the living room goes silent.[lr]::
14601::$$$message_0136_0105_0001$$$::And yet...[lr]::
14602::$$$message_0136_0105_0002$$$::A soft, rustling sound ripples through the house.::
14603::$$$message_0136_0106_0000$$$::"Is that alarm this house's Bounded Field?"[lr]::
14604::$$$message_0136_0106_0001$$$::I nod in silence.[lr]::
14605::$$$message_0136_0106_0002$$$::It's the same sound as when Lancer broke in.[lr]::
14606::$$$message_0136_0106_0003$$$::Then that can only mean...::
14607::$$$message_0136_0107_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
14608::$$$message_0136_0107_0001$$$::The sounds are getting closer. Louder.[lr]::
14609::$$$message_0136_0107_0002$$$::Something is...sliding against or across something else.[lr]::
14610::$$$message_0136_0107_0003$$$::It sounds like a swarm of bugs rushing toward the light.::
14611::$$$message_0136_0108_0000$$$::The only place that sound doesn't seem to be coming from is the living room.[lr]::
14612::$$$message_0136_0108_0001$$$::It's not even been a minute since the lights went out, and we're surrounded on all sides by that sound.::
14613::$$$message_0136_0109_0000$$$::"An enemy. But it doesn't seem like a Servant..."[lr]::
14614::$$$message_0136_0109_0001$$$::There's just too many of them.[lr]::
14615::$$$message_0136_0109_0002$$$::Whatever people might say, I do have some knowledge of mages and magecraft.[lr]::
14616::$$$message_0136_0109_0003$$$::Even I can sense that there's a lot of magical energy coming from a ton of people or things surrounding the house.::
14617::$$$message_0136_0110_0000$$$::Twenty, at least.[lr]::
14618::$$$message_0136_0110_0001$$$::But they also seem weirdly light.[lr]::
14619::$$$message_0136_0110_0002$$$::I don't sense any human will or intellect.[lr]::
14620::$$$message_0136_0110_0003$$$::The flapping sounds seem to be coming from enemy puppets.::
14621::$$$message_0136_0111_0000$$$::"Oh, so they did come.[lr]::
14622::$$$message_0136_0111_0001$$$::They've been running away from me this entire time, but now that Berserker's gone, here they are again.[lr]::
14623::$$$message_0136_0111_0002$$$::What a shrewd Servant."[lr]::
14624::$$$message_0136_0111_0003$$$::Illya speaks up amid the flapping sounds.[lr]::
14625::$$$message_0136_0111_0004$$$::She, unlike the three of us, is strangely calm.::
14626::$$$message_0136_0112_0000$$$::"Do you know who that is, Illya!?"[lr]::
14627::$$$message_0136_0112_0001$$$::"Of course I do. I know all the Servants. Caster is out there, and she's brought quite an entourage with her. They look like cheap golems made with dragon teeth."::
14628::$$$message_0136_0113_0000$$$::Illya is so casual about this.[lr]::
14629::$$$message_0136_0113_0001$$$::And just then, the sound stops.::
14630::$$$message_0136_0114_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14631::$$$message_0136_0114_0001$$$::I grab the wooden sword in the living room.[lr]::
14632::$$$message_0136_0114_0002$$$::Saber and Tohsaka seem to be waiting for me to make a move.[lr]::
14633::$$$message_0136_0114_0003$$$::I...[lr]::
