6647::$$$message_0058_0000_0000$$$::I should call Tohsaka back.[lr]::
6648::$$$message_0058_0000_0001$$$::I shouldn't break any more lamps.[lr]::
6649::$$$message_0058_0000_0002$$$::...Actually, I really shouldn't be talking big after breaking over forty lamps.::
6650::$$$message_0058_0001_0000$$$::"Hey Tohsaka."[lr]::
6651::$$$message_0058_0001_0001$$$::I call out to her, but there's no answer.[lr]::
6652::$$$message_0058_0001_0002$$$::That's weird. Did she step out of the house?[lr]::
6653::$$$message_0058_0001_0003$$$::Where else might Tohsaka go...?::
6654::$$$message_0058_0002_0000$$$::"There's someone in the shed."[lr]::
6655::$$$message_0058_0002_0001$$$::It sounds like Tohsaka and Saber are talking inside.[lr]::
6656::$$$message_0058_0002_0002$$$::"Hey, Tohsa[line2]"[lr]::
6657::$$$message_0058_0002_0003$$$::The instant I lift a hand to call out to her...::
6658::$$$message_0058_0003_0000$$$::A chill runs up my spine.[lr]::
6659::$$$message_0058_0003_0001$$$::I think it's because I can feel Tohsaka's magical energy seeping from the shed. It pulses with enmity.::
6660::$$$message_0058_0004_0000$$$::"What the...?"[lr]::
6661::$$$message_0058_0004_0001$$$::I immediately stop calling for her.[lr]::
6662::$$$message_0058_0004_0002$$$::Even from here, I can tell Tohsaka is agitated.::
6663::$$$message_0058_0005_0000$$$::But I can hear the two of them talking.[lr]::
6664::$$$message_0058_0005_0001$$$::Before I know it, I'm eavesdropping.::
6665::$$$message_0058_0006_0000$$$::"What's up with him!?"[lr]::
6666::$$$message_0058_0006_0001$$$::Tohsaka sounds both angry and nervous.[lr]::
6667::$$$message_0058_0006_0002$$$::Saber stands silently behind her.::
6668::$$$message_0058_0007_0000$$$::"I don't believe it. Saber, did you know about this?"[lr]::
6669::$$$message_0058_0007_0001$$$::"No, I did not. I am a knight, not a mage. I only felt something was amiss. I do not understand the situation as well as you, Rin."::
6670::$$$message_0058_0008_0000$$$::"I see. Then let me tell you. He's no mage."::
6671::$$$message_0058_0009_0000$$$::"What do you mean by that?"[lr]::
6672::$$$message_0058_0009_0001$$$::"I mean what I said.[lr]::
6673::$$$message_0058_0009_0002$$$::Magecraft is ultimately equivalent exchange. No matter what kind of Mystics you're talking about, all it does is take something from somewhere else and put it to use."::
6674::$$$message_0058_0010_0000$$$::"But this is different. He is creating something from nothing. He's taking something that shouldn't exist and giving it shape.[lr]::
6675::$$$message_0058_0010_0001$$$::This is...a concept encroaching on reality itself.[lr]::
6676::$$$message_0058_0010_0002$$$::His magecraft is nothing but a degraded version of it."::
6677::$$$message_0058_0011_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
6678::$$$message_0058_0011_0001$$$::I have no idea what Tohsaka is saying.[lr]::
6679::$$$message_0058_0011_0002$$$::But I definitely shouldn't be listening in on the two of them.[lr]::
6680::$$$message_0058_0011_0003$$$::I walk away from the shed.[lr]::
6681::$$$message_0058_0011_0004$$$::I'll be lying to Tohsaka, but I should go back to her room and pretend I was waiting for her to come back...::
