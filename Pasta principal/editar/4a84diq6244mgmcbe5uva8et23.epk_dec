20017::$$$message_0182_0000_0000$$$::I manage to make it home, leaning on Saber's shoulder.[lr]::
20018::$$$message_0182_0000_0001$$$::The wound in my chest hasn't completely healed.[lr]::
20019::$$$message_0182_0000_0002$$$::According to Saber, I'll need to lie still for a few hours.::
20020::$$$message_0182_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20021::$$$message_0182_0001_0001$$$::I bite my lip.[lr]::
20022::$$$message_0182_0001_0002$$$::I curse my body for refusing to listen to me, even though I know what I need to do now.::
20023::$$$message_0182_0002_0000$$$::"Shirou. Are you thinking of doing something rash?"[lr]::
20024::$$$message_0182_0002_0001$$$::"Eh? U-uh, no, I wasn't thinking about anything."::
20025::$$$message_0182_0003_0000$$$::"I will be very angry if you do something reckless.[lr]::
20026::$$$message_0182_0003_0001$$$::You must not fight until your wounds have fully healed. This will be our final battle, so we must both be at our very best."::
20027::$$$message_0182_0004_0000$$$::"Yeah. We're better off preparing ourselves than getting impatient."[lr]::
20028::$$$message_0182_0004_0001$$$::I'm thinking about where Kotomine went...[lr]::
20029::$$$message_0182_0004_0002$$$::...about how to defeat Gilgamesh.[lr]::
20030::$$$message_0182_0004_0003$$$::There's just so much we need to consider.[lr]::
20031::$$$message_0182_0004_0004$$$::For now though, we need to rest and wait until night.::
20032::$$$message_0182_0005_0000$$$::At that moment, my mind freezes.::
20033::$$$message_0182_0006_0000$$$::"Eh...?"[lr]::
20034::$$$message_0182_0006_0001$$$::There's nobody inside.[lr]::
20035::$$$message_0182_0006_0002$$$::The house feels different.[lr]::
20036::$$$message_0182_0006_0003$$$::Mingled with the smell of something burning, I can just pick out the strong scent of blood.::
20037::$$$message_0182_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20038::$$$message_0182_0007_0001$$$::I run.[lr]::
20039::$$$message_0182_0007_0002$$$::I ignore my chest wound; I run to shake off the chill running down my back.[lr]::
20040::$$$message_0182_0007_0003$$$::I run through the corridor, turn a corner, and pass through the familiar curtain that divides one room of the house from another.::
20041::$$$message_0182_0008_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
20042::$$$message_0182_0008_0001$$$::The scene that greets me is anything but familiar.::
20043::$$$message_0182_0009_0000$$$::"Toh...saka..."[lr]::
20044::$$$message_0182_0009_0001$$$::My voice trembles.[lr]::
20045::$$$message_0182_0009_0002$$$::I don't know what happened.[lr]::
20046::$$$message_0182_0009_0003$$$::All I know is that Tohsaka is looking at me, breathing weakly.::
20047::$$$message_0182_0010_0000$$$::"Ah...you're finally...home. You're so late, I was about to go to sleep...dummy."[lr]::
20048::$$$message_0182_0010_0001$$$::What the hell is she saying?[lr]::
20049::$$$message_0182_0010_0002$$$::It looks like she's really struggling even to speak, but she tries to make conversation like nothing's wrong.::
20050::$$$message_0182_0011_0000$$$::"Wha...don't talk, you idiot! Damn...we need to stop the bleeding! Saber, get some towels and a washbasin with warm water from the bathroom!"[lr]::
20051::$$$message_0182_0011_0001$$$::Saber nods and turns to run to the bathroom.::
20052::$$$message_0182_0012_0000$$$::"Bandages. I need bandages and some styptic...I don't think styptic will be enough for this! Dammit! I need a doctor! I need to call a doctor to treat her!"[lr]::
20053::$$$message_0182_0012_0001$$$::I panic as I pull out the first aid kit.::
20054::$$$message_0182_0013_0000$$$::"It's fine. I already treated myself. I don't need a doctor.[lr]::
20055::$$$message_0182_0013_0001$$$::There's something more important you need to do first."[lr]::
20056::$$$message_0182_0013_0002$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
20057::$$$message_0182_0013_0003$$$::Tohsaka is panting, but she looks straight at me.::
20058::$$$message_0182_0014_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka?"[lr]::
20059::$$$message_0182_0014_0001$$$::I don't know what the hell she's trying to say.[lr]::
20060::$$$message_0182_0014_0002$$$::I'm confused, but I just nod to listen to what she has to say.::
20061::$$$message_0182_0015_0000$$$::"Are you sure you're going to be okay?[lr]::
20062::$$$message_0182_0015_0001$$$::There's so much blood..."[lr]::
20063::$$$message_0182_0015_0002$$$::"It's fine. I can stop my own bleeding.[lr]::
20064::$$$message_0182_0015_0003$$$::But more importantly, I'm sorry. I was supposed to be taking care of her, but I couldn't protect Illya."::
20065::$$$message_0182_0016_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
20066::$$$message_0182_0016_0001$$$::I finally put two and two together.[lr]::
20067::$$$message_0182_0016_0002$$$::Tohsaka wounded.[lr]::
20068::$$$message_0182_0016_0003$$$::The living room in disarray.[lr]::
20069::$$$message_0182_0016_0004$$$::And...[lr]::
20070::$$$message_0182_0016_0005$$$::Illya...gone.::
20071::$$$message_0182_0017_0000$$$::"Did Kotomine come here?"[lr]::
20072::$$$message_0182_0017_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20073::$$$message_0182_0017_0002$$$::She nods.[lr]::
20074::$$$message_0182_0017_0003$$$::He's the only enemy left, so there wasn't much point in asking.::
20075::$$$message_0182_0018_0000$$$::But Saber and I were the only ones who knew Kotomine was our enemy.[lr]::
20076::$$$message_0182_0018_0001$$$::It must have been a shock for Tohsaka.[lr]::
20077::$$$message_0182_0018_0002$$$::The seventh Master is her teacher and guardian.::
20078::$$$message_0182_0019_0000$$$::"Don't apologize. Even you wouldn't have been able to do anything in an ambush. I know that, whatever you said, you always trusted Kotomine."::
20079::$$$message_0182_0020_0000$$$::"I suppose. Honestly, I underestimated him. I guess I got a little cocky, thinking I could do everything on my own."[lr]::
20080::$$$message_0182_0020_0001$$$::She coughs up blood.[lr]::
20081::$$$message_0182_0020_0002$$$::Crap. I can't let her keep talking.::
20082::$$$message_0182_0021_0000$$$::"Let's talk later. Just don't move. We'll get you treated, then you can rest up."[lr]::
20083::$$$message_0182_0021_0001$$$::"Yeah, that's good. But before that, I think I need to tell you something.[lr]::
20084::$$$message_0182_0021_0002$$$::Shirou. This is the last advice I have for you, so listen good."::
20085::$$$message_0182_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20086::$$$message_0182_0022_0001$$$::That's...ominous.[lr]::
20087::$$$message_0182_0022_0002$$$::But I just nod.[lr]::
20088::$$$message_0182_0022_0003$$$::This is serious, especially if she's so insistent on telling me, even as wounded as she is.[lr]::
20089::$$$message_0182_0022_0004$$$::I couldn't stop her from speaking up now, even if I wanted to.::
20090::$$$message_0182_0023_0000$$$::"First. Kotomine's objective was Illya. He must have known from the very beginning that she would be the vessel for the Holy Grail."[lr]::
20091::$$$message_0182_0023_0001$$$::"Wha...!? Illya's the Holy Grail!?"::
20092::$$$message_0182_0024_0000$$$::"Her heart, to be precise. Mages are humans with Magic Circuits, but Illya's a human [font italic=true]made from[font italic=false] Magic Circuits.[lr]::
20093::$$$message_0182_0024_0001$$$::As soon as there's only one Servant left, she'll become the vessel that summons the Holy Grail."::
20094::$$$message_0182_0025_0000$$$::"Then Kotomine's taken Illya to...?"[lr]::
20095::$$$message_0182_0025_0001$$$::"Yep, he took her away. But[line2]guh! If Saber's still around, the path won't open. So I don't think Kotomine will harm Illya, since she's the vessel."::
20096::$$$message_0182_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20097::$$$message_0182_0026_0001$$$::I can only hope so.[lr]::
20098::$$$message_0182_0026_0002$$$::And Lancer won't be an easy Servant to beat.[lr]::
20099::$$$message_0182_0026_0003$$$::Even if he couldn't defeat Gilgamesh, he might at least have been able to run away.[lr]::
20100::$$$message_0182_0026_0004$$$::I'll just have to hope he did. This isn't the time to tell Tohsaka anyway.::
20101::$$$message_0182_0027_0000$$$::"Got it. I'll go save Illya, so don't worry."[lr]::
20102::$$$message_0182_0027_0001$$$::"Okay. Now the second thing.[lr]::
20103::$$$message_0182_0027_0002$$$::I think Kotomine's at Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
20104::$$$message_0182_0027_0003$$$::I can't think of anywhere else to summon the Holy Grail.[lr]::
20105::$$$message_0182_0027_0004$$$::He probably abandoned the church already, and if he's going to hide, it's got to be there."::
20106::$$$message_0182_0028_0000$$$::"Got it. Kotomine's at Ryudou Temple."[lr]::
20107::$$$message_0182_0028_0001$$$::She doesn't even seem to have the strength to move her head.[lr]::
20108::$$$message_0182_0028_0002$$$::But she nods anyway.::
20109::$$$message_0182_0029_0000$$$::"Okay, last thing. You can't beat Kirei. Are you still going to fight him?"[lr]::
20110::$$$message_0182_0029_0001$$$::That question...[lr]::
20111::$$$message_0182_0029_0002$$$::She's not asking as a friend, but as a mage who truly understands the situation.[lr]::
