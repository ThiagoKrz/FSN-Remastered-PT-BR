36327::$$$message_0303_0000_0000$$$::"I'm home."[lr]::
36328::$$$message_0303_0000_0001$$$::Even though I don't really feel it, I try to carry on with the normal routine.::
36329::$$$message_0303_0001_0000$$$::It feels like a lot is going on in the living room.[lr]::
36330::$$$message_0303_0001_0001$$$::I bet Fuji-nee is watching TV, and Sakura is preparing dinner.[lr]::
36331::$$$message_0303_0001_0002$$$::Saber... Is she in the living room?::
36332::$$$message_0303_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36333::$$$message_0303_0002_0001$$$::I shake my head when Archer's words flash through my mind. ::
36334::$$$message_0303_0003_0000$$$::I don't know what he wanted to say nor do I want to know.[lr]::
36335::$$$message_0303_0003_0001$$$::But it's stuck in my head, and I can't ignore it.[lr]::
36336::$$$message_0303_0003_0002$$$::A familiar called a Servant.[lr]::
36337::$$$message_0303_0003_0003$$$::His honest opinion, scorning Heroic Spirits like they're merely a cleanup crew.::
36338::$$$message_0303_0004_0000$$$::"Oh. Welcome home, Senpai."[lr]::
36339::$$$message_0303_0004_0001$$$::"Thanks. I'm sorry I'm late. How much of dinner's done?"::
36340::$$$message_0303_0005_0000$$$::"I just started. But I don't think I need your help. We're having stew tonight as per Ms. Fujimura's request."::
36341::$$$message_0303_0006_0000$$$::"I see. Yeah, I can't help with that."[lr]::
36342::$$$message_0303_0006_0001$$$::I see that all the ingredients are cut up already.[lr]::
36343::$$$message_0303_0006_0002$$$::Sakura is efficient, so surely all that's left is to simmer them.::
36344::$$$message_0303_0007_0000$$$::"...Where's Saber? I don't see her in the living room."[lr]::
36345::$$$message_0303_0007_0001$$$::"She is taking a nap in the other room. She said to wake her up when you came home, but..."[lr]::
36346::$$$message_0303_0007_0002$$$::"...Hm. Was she mad?"::
36347::$$$message_0303_0008_0000$$$::"Um... I don't think so? Though Saber always looks a little on edge."::
36348::$$$message_0303_0009_0000$$$::...If Sakura is hesitant to say it, it must mean that Saber was really mad.[lr]::
36349::$$$message_0303_0009_0001$$$::It's only natural though, since I broke our promise of coming home before dark.::
36350::$$$message_0303_0010_0000$$$::"Hey, welcome home, Shirou. Saber was really mad. She said she wanted to talk to you in the dojo once you're home."[lr]::
36351::$$$message_0303_0010_0001$$$::Fuji-nee makes a frightening statement while munching on a mandarin.::
36352::$$$message_0303_0011_0000$$$::"...Fuji-nee. You didn't drill anything weird into Saber's head, right? ...Um, like a person who breaks a promise should be punished by getting beaten with a shinai or something."::
36353::$$$message_0303_0012_0000$$$::"I did. We're athletes, so I told her that she doesn't need to hold back."[lr]::
36354::$$$message_0303_0012_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36355::$$$message_0303_0012_0002$$$::I see.[lr]::
36356::$$$message_0303_0012_0003$$$::The other Masters aren't my only problem. An enemy force has already infiltrated my home.::
36357::$$$message_0303_0013_0000$$$::"This is off topic, but did you take Saber to the dojo? Did you tell her to use a shinai if she wanted to practice?"::
36358::$$$message_0303_0014_0000$$$::"Yeah, I fought with her a bit, but she's amazing. She doesn't even know kendo, but she seems even more like a Japanese fencer than I do. She do Western fencing where she's from?"::
36359::$$$message_0303_0015_0000$$$::"No, I don't think so. I think she's actually a lot like you."[lr]::
36360::$$$message_0303_0015_0001$$$::...Like how she swings around a huge sword that doesn't suit her frame, or how she attacks enemies like a wild animal.::
36361::$$$message_0303_0016_0000$$$::"Oh well, I'll accept my punishment since it's my fault.[lr]::
36362::$$$message_0303_0016_0001$$$::By the way, about Mitsuzuri. Do you know if she's home or not?"::
36363::$$$message_0303_0017_0000$$$::"Huh? Why do you know about that? You shouldn't have been informed yet."[lr]::
36364::$$$message_0303_0017_0001$$$::"Yeah, I heard about it in the student council room... So, how about it? Did anyone find Mitsuzuri?"::
36365::$$$message_0303_0018_0000$$$::I stare at Fuji-nee.[lr]::
36366::$$$message_0303_0018_0001$$$::...Fuji-nee is still a teacher, even if she may not seem like one.[lr]::
36367::$$$message_0303_0018_0002$$$::She keeps quiet about things she shouldn't talk about, and I'm sure she'd lie to keep students calm.[lr]::
36368::$$$message_0303_0018_0003$$$::So I have to make sure I don't overlook anything she says or does when it comes to this.::
36369::$$$message_0303_0019_0000$$$::"So, Fuji-nee. Has nothing changed?"[lr]::
36370::$$$message_0303_0019_0001$$$::"...I guess I can't keep it from you. You look like you'll go run out if I keep quiet, and it's not like this is a secret.[lr]::
36371::$$$message_0303_0019_0002$$$::But this is special treatment, okay? I'm telling you since you're her friend."::
36372::$$$message_0303_0020_0000$$$::"I know. I'll owe you one, so tell me already."[lr]::
36373::$$$message_0303_0020_0001$$$::"Well, to start at the end, they found her and she ought to be home by now. I'd assume the examination is over by now.[lr]::
36374::$$$message_0303_0020_0002$$$::She's kind of confused, but she's uninjured and her life isn't in danger. I can't tell you anything else, though. You're friends so you should ask her about it yourself."::
36375::$$$message_0303_0021_0000$$$::"...I see.[lr]::
36376::$$$message_0303_0021_0001$$$::So it wasn't serious, huh?"::
36377::$$$message_0303_0022_0000$$$::...I'm glad.[lr]::
36378::$$$message_0303_0022_0001$$$::I still don't know what Mitsuzuri got into, but I can tell that it has something to do with the strange incidents happening in town.[lr]::
36379::$$$message_0303_0022_0002$$$::There's a high possibility that the culprit is the Master hiding at my school.[lr]::
36380::$$$message_0303_0022_0003$$$::I don't know what I would've done if something happened to Mitsuzuri.::
36381::$$$message_0303_0023_0000$$$::"...Oh yeah. Sakura, can I talk to you for a bit?"[lr]::
36382::$$$message_0303_0023_0001$$$::"...Yes? What is it, Senpai?"[lr]::
36383::$$$message_0303_0023_0002$$$::"Well, it's nothing much. I was just wondering if you knew what Shinji is up to."::
36384::$$$message_0303_0024_0000$$$::"Um... I'm sorry, Senpai. I spent the night here last night and went to school, so I haven't been home. I heard that he skipped school today, but um..."::
36385::$$$message_0303_0025_0000$$$::"So you don't know the situation, huh? ...Yeah, there's no way that you would know. Sorry, dumb question."::
36386::$$$message_0303_0026_0000$$$::"No, it's okay! I know my brother more than anyone else, so I should know why he skipped, right?"[lr]::
36387::$$$message_0303_0026_0001$$$::"No, that's not your responsibility. Besides, it really helps to have you here."::
36388::$$$message_0303_0027_0000$$$::...The incident in the woods.[lr]::
36389::$$$message_0303_0027_0001$$$::If the one that was there was actually Shinji, then he has to have some kind of connection to the Servant in black.[lr]::
36390::$$$message_0303_0027_0002$$$::Worst case scenario, there's a possibility that he's the Master.[lr]::
36391::$$$message_0303_0027_0003$$$::If that's the case, wouldn't it be dangerous to let Sakura go back to the Matou household?::
36392::$$$message_0303_0028_0000$$$::"Senpai, what does that mean..."[lr]::
36393::$$$message_0303_0028_0001$$$::"...Sakura, spend the night here tonight. You can use Fuji-nee's clothes if you don't have spares."[lr]::
36394::$$$message_0303_0028_0002$$$::"Huh... S-Senpai, is that, um..."::
36395::$$$message_0303_0029_0000$$$::"I'd feel better about it if you can stay here for a while if you can.[lr]::
36396::$$$message_0303_0029_0001$$$::Well, you can go home if it's really that much of a pain."[lr]::
36397::$$$message_0303_0029_0002$$$::...Oh.[lr]::
36398::$$$message_0303_0029_0003$$$::Right, this is really coming out of nowhere for her. It really puts her on the spot, too.::
36399::$$$message_0303_0030_0000$$$::"Sorry for being so pushy about this."[lr]::
36400::$$$message_0303_0030_0001$$$::I bow my head in apology.[lr]::
36401::$$$message_0303_0030_0002$$$::   Then...[lr]::
36402::$$$message_0303_0030_0003$$$::"...Okay. I will take you up on your offer."[lr]::
36403::$$$message_0303_0030_0004$$$::Sakura nods and agrees so quietly that it blends in with the sound of the brewing stew.:kÚú
