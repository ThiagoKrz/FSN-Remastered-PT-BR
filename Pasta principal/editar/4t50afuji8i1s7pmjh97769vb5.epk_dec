14273::$$$message_0135_0000_0000$$$::Hi there! This is Tiger Dojo, the training area that saves you people who fell straight into cat hell because you made a trivial mistake!::
14274::$$$message_0135_0000_0001$$$::Yes ma'am! I'm Disciple Number One, pumped up and in the groove now!::
14275::$$$message_0135_0000_0002$$$::Cat and heaven!::
14276::$$$message_0135_0000_0003$$$::Owww... Why would you take a swing at me, Tiger!?[r][wsay canskip=1]::
14277::$$$message_0135_0000_0004$$$::Did I do something bad?::
14278::$$$message_0135_0000_0005$$$::You shut your mouth! This is the eighth episode of Tiger Dojo, and you've killed Shirou [font italic=true]five times[font italic=false] now![lr]::
14279::$$$message_0135_0000_0006$$$::It's mass murder!::
14280::$$$message_0135_0000_0007$$$::What? I don't think it's that bad.[lr]::
14281::$$$message_0135_0000_0008$$$::I mean, by the end, the one who kills Shirou most is[line2]::
14282::$$$message_0135_0000_0009$$$::Stop right there! Eat my spoiler sword!::
14283::$$$message_0135_0000_0010$$$::Heh. It's not going to get me![lr]::
14284::$$$message_0135_0000_0011$$$::Besides, I'm at the bottom of the list.[lr]::
14285::$$$message_0135_0000_0012$$$::See? Take a look at this notebook.::
14286::$$$message_0135_0000_0013$$$::Whoa. I didn't know there was an actual list of killers floating around.[lr]::
14287::$$$message_0135_0000_0014$$$::Oh, what the... You're right. What are all these absurd, fabricated records!?[lr]::
14288::$$$message_0135_0000_0015$$$::Why does Illya get the "Good Girl Award"?::
14289::$$$message_0135_0000_0016$$$::Because I carry myself elegantly.[lr]::
14290::$$$message_0135_0000_0017$$$::If you're bored, check out all the endings where I kill Shirou.::
14291::$$$message_0135_0000_0018$$$::You'll notice it's slightly different than the winner of the Last Kill Award.::
14292::$$$message_0135_0000_0019$$$::Slightly different? Well, I guess I'm not going to dwell on the details.[lr]::
14293::$$$message_0135_0000_0020$$$::Thinking hurts anyway.::
14294::$$$message_0135_0000_0021$$$::Okay, so in this episode of Tiger Dojo...[lr]::
14295::$$$message_0135_0000_0022$$$::I don't think you made any bad choices, but why do you think it ended up like this? Answer, Disciple Number One!::
14296::$$$message_0135_0000_0023$$$::You ran out of magical energy.[lr]::
14297::$$$message_0135_0000_0024$$$::Saber had recovered to the point where she could deploy Excalibur, but there just wasn't enough magical energy to use in her Noble Phantasm.::
14298::$$$message_0135_0000_0025$$$::A weakened Excalibur like that couldn't possibly wipe out Berserker's two lives.::
14299::$$$message_0135_0000_0026$$$::I see. So this time around, you lost because you made a sensible choice.::
14300::$$$message_0135_0000_0027$$$::Yes, ma'am. You'll die if you go on the defensive, but you'll also die if you try to get too aggressive... What a crazy tightrope you're ｗalking.::
14301::$$$message_0135_0000_0028$$$::It's a delicate balancing act, as usual.::
14302::$$$message_0135_0000_0029$$$::Delicate may not be the best way to describe it... It's more like there's nothing you can do given the characters' abilities.::
14303::$$$message_0135_0000_0030$$$::Is that so, meow? Then this concludes this episode of the dojo.[lr]::
14304::$$$message_0135_0000_0031$$$::Go back to the previous choice and choose the more reckless, youthful...and immature option!::
