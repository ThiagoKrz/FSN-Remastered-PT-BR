39574::$$$message_0339_0000_0001$$$::I say to the mage, without looking away.::
39575::$$$message_0339_0001_0000$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
39576::$$$message_0339_0001_0001$$$::Three people gasp.[lr]::
39577::$$$message_0339_0001_0002$$$::Nobody here expected me to choose that option.::
39578::$$$message_0339_0002_0000$$$::"A-Are you insane...? Do you understand the position you are in?"[lr]::
39579::$$$message_0339_0002_0001$$$::"Yeah. I get your argument. I think what you're saying is correct."::
39580::$$$message_0339_0003_0000$$$::If we can avoid battles, we should avoid them. And if the Holy Grail can be shared, we should share it.[lr]::
39581::$$$message_0339_0003_0001$$$::    But...::
39582::$$$message_0339_0004_0000$$$::"But, I won't cooperate with a witch who attacks people indiscriminately.[lr]::
39583::$$$message_0339_0004_0001$$$::Your argument is correct, but your method is wrong.[lr]::
39584::$$$message_0339_0004_0002$$$::...And one more thing. I wasn't forced to be a mage. I succeeded my old man out of my own will.[lr]::
39585::$$$message_0339_0004_0003$$$::   You have no right to say anything about it."::
39586::$$$message_0339_0005_0000$$$::"...I see. Then I do not need you. You can die here."[lr]::
39587::$$$message_0339_0005_0001$$$::Caster's voice is filled with murderous intent.::
39588::$$$message_0339_0006_0000$$$::"You..."[lr]::
39589::$$$message_0339_0006_0001$$$::At the same time, Saber braces herself.[lr]::
39590::$$$message_0339_0006_0002$$$::Seeing that...[lr]::
39591::$$$message_0339_0006_0003$$$::"Don't move, Saber...!"[lr]::
39592::$$$message_0339_0006_0004$$$::I stop her with all my might.::
39593::$$$message_0339_0007_0000$$$::"...Please. Don't move, Saber. You too, Tohsaka. We can't move right now."[lr]::
39594::$$$message_0339_0007_0001$$$::She'll be killed if any one of us moves.[lr]::
39595::$$$message_0339_0007_0002$$$::In this house...[lr]::
39596::$$$message_0339_0007_0003$$$::I would lose the person who has been like my older sister and stayed with me until now, in this very living room.::
39597::$$$message_0339_0008_0000$$$::"...But Shirou..."[lr]::
39598::$$$message_0339_0008_0001$$$::"...Idiot. Then why did you refuse?"[lr]::
39599::$$$message_0339_0008_0002$$$::Still, they both stopped.[lr]::
39600::$$$message_0339_0008_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
39601::$$$message_0339_0008_0004$$$::I take one step towards Caster, trying to hide them.::
39602::$$$message_0339_0009_0000$$$::"Oh. I thought you might be clueless, but it seems like you at least understand your position."[lr]::
39603::$$$message_0339_0009_0001$$$::A smile returns to Caster's face.[lr]::
39604::$$$message_0339_0009_0002$$$::...That arm.[lr]::
39605::$$$message_0339_0009_0003$$$::Her left arm that was carrying Fuji-nee points slowly at me.::
39606::$$$message_0339_0010_0000$$$::"Guh...! How unfair, are you going to kill Shirou when he isn't resisting...!?"[lr]::
39607::$$$message_0339_0010_0001$$$::"Of course not. I won't take his life. He is just going to lose his rights as a Master. You seem to have only one left, but hand over that Command Spell.[lr]::
39608::$$$message_0339_0010_0002$$$::You will not cooperate with me, yet you want to save this girl.[lr]::
39609::$$$message_0339_0010_0003$$$::You should have been prepared for this when you said that."::
39610::$$$message_0339_0011_0000$$$::"Oh...!"[lr]::
39611::$$$message_0339_0011_0001$$$::Saber's breath stops.[lr]::
39612::$$$message_0339_0011_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
39613::$$$message_0339_0011_0003$$$:: I apologize to Saber in my head and take one step closer to Caster.::
39614::$$$message_0339_0012_0000$$$::"...Got it. But how should I give you the Command Spell?[lr]::
39615::$$$message_0339_0012_0001$$$::I don't know how to hand it to people."[lr]::
39616::$$$message_0339_0012_0002$$$::"Shirou...! It is no use...!"::
39617::$$$message_0339_0013_0000$$$::"Let us see. I can transplant it if there is no interruption, but that does not seem likely here. It is not possible to do it unless we relocate to a place where we can settle down. So...::
39618::$$$message_0339_0014_0000$$$::    Rip off your skin. Here."::
39619::$$$message_0339_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39620::$$$message_0339_0015_0001$$$::The black witch says with a smile.::
39621::$$$message_0339_0016_0000$$$::"...That is it.[lr]::
39622::$$$message_0339_0016_0001$$$::Shirou, please give up on Taiga. We cannot let Caster get her way any further...!"[lr]::
39623::$$$message_0339_0016_0002$$$::"I agree. First of all, she's not one to release a hostage. She'll just use you until the end if you obey her."::
39624::$$$message_0339_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39625::$$$message_0339_0017_0001$$$::Both are right.[lr]::
39626::$$$message_0339_0017_0002$$$::That's why for now, I can only apologize to them in my head.::
39627::$$$message_0339_0018_0000$$$::"...Take it. This is what you want, right?"[lr]::
39628::$$$message_0339_0018_0001$$$::I raise my left arm.[lr]::
39629::$$$message_0339_0018_0002$$$::Caster should be able to take away my Command Spell, along with my flesh, with just one word.::
39630::$$$message_0339_0019_0000$$$::"...No, Shirou...!"[lr]::
39631::$$$message_0339_0019_0001$$$::"What's wrong with you...!? There's no need to go that far to save someone else...!"[lr]::
39632::$$$message_0339_0019_0002$$$::"There is. If I'm able to save Fuji-nee at the cost of just one arm, there's no need to think about it."[lr]::
39633::$$$message_0339_0019_0003$$$::I show my left arm to Caster.::
39634::$$$message_0339_0020_0000$$$::"...All right. Come here, Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
39635::$$$message_0339_0020_0001$$$::I do not know what you are scheming, but my finger is faster than any surprise attack."[lr]::
39636::$$$message_0339_0020_0002$$$::Caster does not seem to trust me, as she carefully puts distance between us.::
39637::$$$message_0339_0021_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
39638::$$$message_0339_0021_0001$$$::I walk closer.[lr]::
39639::$$$message_0339_0021_0002$$$::...Caster's right in front of me, and I'm far from the other two.[lr]::
39640::$$$message_0339_0021_0003$$$::I walked to a position where I couldn't escape from and offered my left arm.::
39641::$$$message_0339_0022_0000$$$::"Ha..."[lr]::
39642::$$$message_0339_0022_0001$$$::The black witch watches me in astonishment.::
39643::$$$message_0339_0023_0000$$$::"Haha. Muahaha, muahahahahahaha...!!![lr]::
39644::$$$message_0339_0023_0001$$$::I am surprised. What a good person you are, boy! Fine, I shall return this woman in deference to your good faith!"[lr]::
39645::$$$message_0339_0023_0002$$$::Her robe flutters.[lr]::
39646::$$$message_0339_0023_0003$$$::While keeping her grip on Fuji-nee's neck with her left arm, Caster takes out a dagger with her remaining right hand. ::
39647::$$$message_0339_0024_0000$$$::"What a joke, I didn't have to go through the trouble if it was going to be like this![lr]::
39648::$$$message_0339_0024_0001$$$::What a stupid kid. An annoying people pleaser like you deserves to die...!"[lr]::
39649::$$$message_0339_0024_0002$$$::She swings her dagger.[lr]::
39650::$$$message_0339_0024_0003$$$::It goes not for my arm, but down towards my chest as if to take my heart…::
39651::$$$message_0339_0025_0000$$$::"Caster...!"[lr]::
39652::$$$message_0339_0025_0001$$$::She explodes.[lr]::
39653::$$$message_0339_0025_0002$$$::Saber steps in with speed that I could only imagine. ::
39654::$$$message_0339_0026_0000$$$::"...Guh!?"[lr]::
39655::$$$message_0339_0026_0001$$$::That speed must've been faster than Caster had expected, as she is unable to react to her dagger being repelled.[lr]::
39656::$$$message_0339_0026_0002$$$::Caster retreats and Saber goes after her.[lr]::
39657::$$$message_0339_0026_0003$$$::She must've realized that she can't get away.::
39658::$$$message_0339_0027_0000$$$::"I see, then..."[lr]::
39659::$$$message_0339_0027_0001$$$::Smiling happily, Caster puts strength into her right arm and...::
39660::$$$message_0339_0028_0000$$$::"...No, stop, Saber...!!!"[lr]::
39661::$$$message_0339_0028_0001$$$::I pray from the bottom of my heart and extend my raised left arm.::
39662::$$$message_0339_0029_0000$$$::"Wha... Shirou, you used the Command Spell..."[lr]::
39663::$$$message_0339_0029_0001$$$::Saber stops.[lr]::
39664::$$$message_0339_0029_0002$$$::Her movements are stopped by the absolute obedience enforced by the Command Spell.::
39665::$$$message_0339_0030_0000$$$::There...[lr]::
39666::$$$message_0339_0030_0001$$$::With a thud…[lr]::
39667::$$$message_0339_0030_0002$$$::The dagger is stabbed as easily as making footsteps in snow.::
39668::$$$message_0339_0031_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
39669::$$$message_0339_0031_0001$$$::An illusion as though time has stopped.[lr]::
39670::$$$message_0339_0031_0002$$$::Saber looks down at her own chest, dumbfounded.::
39671::$$$message_0339_0032_0000$$$::"Caster, you..."[lr]::
39672::$$$message_0339_0032_0001$$$::"Yes. This is my Noble Phantasm, Saber. It has no lethality and is nothing more than a ritualistic key.[lr]::
39673::$$$message_0339_0032_0002$$$::But... This is a blade of betrayal that overturns any contract. We are now the same.[lr]::
39674::$$$message_0339_0032_0003$$$::Betray your Master and entrust your sword to me."::
39675::$$$message_0339_0033_0000$$$::"Oh...!?"[lr]::
39676::$$$message_0339_0033_0001$$$::A red light shines through.[lr]::
39677::$$$message_0339_0033_0002$$$::Ominous magical energy flows out.[lr]::
39678::$$$message_0339_0033_0003$$$::It goes through Saber's whole body and destroys every rule that disciplined her...[lr]::
39679::$$$message_0339_0033_0004$$$::It completely cuts my connection with Saber.::
39680::$$$message_0339_0034_0000$$$::"Haah, ah...!"[lr]::
39681::$$$message_0339_0034_0001$$$::Saber crumbles to the floor.[lr]::
39682::$$$message_0339_0034_0002$$$::...A bruise-like seal appears on her forehead.::
39683::$$$message_0339_0035_0000$$$::Three seals appear on Caster who is standing beside her.[lr]::
39684::$$$message_0339_0035_0001$$$::The Command Spell that binds Servants.[lr]::
39685::$$$message_0339_0035_0002$$$::The proof of being Saber's Master that used to be on me, is now on her arm.::
39686::$$$message_0339_0036_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
39687::$$$message_0339_0036_0001$$$::"Are you surprised? This is my Noble Phantasm, 'Rule Breaker.'[lr]::
39688::$$$message_0339_0036_0002$$$::The sword of betrayal and negation that nullifies any magecraft cast in this world."::
39689::$$$message_0339_0037_0000$$$::"Ah... Khh..."[lr]::
39690::$$$message_0339_0037_0001$$$::Saber is panting on the floor.[lr]::
39691::$$$message_0339_0037_0002$$$::As if she is fighting against a poison that entered her body.::
39692::$$$message_0339_0038_0000$$$::"You... A Servant taking another Servant...?"::
39693::$$$message_0339_0039_0000$$$::"Yes, I made her into a familiar, young lady. Now, everything is as planned.[lr]::
39694::$$$message_0339_0039_0001$$$::Shirou Emiya is no longer her Master, and Saber is mine.[lr]::
39695::$$$message_0339_0039_0002$$$::There is nothing to fear now that I have full command of her. Yes, it does not even matter whether Berserker attacks me. I shall go attack them this time...!"[lr]::
39696::$$$message_0339_0039_0003$$$::Caster laughs loudly and holds the collapsed Fuji-nee in her arms.::
39697::$$$message_0339_0040_0000$$$::"Here, I will give her back to you, idiot. She is an important person to you, right? Then you have to do your best until your final moment so she does not die."[lr]::
39698::$$$message_0339_0040_0001$$$::Fuji-nee's body floats.[lr]::
39699::$$$message_0339_0040_0002$$$::As if being pulled by an invisible arm, Fuji-nee's body levitates.::
39700::$$$message_0339_0041_0000$$$::"Ungh, Fuji-nee...!"[lr]::
39701::$$$message_0339_0041_0001$$$::I catch her at once.::
39702::$$$message_0339_0042_0000$$$::"Fuji-nee...! Are you all right, Fuji-nee...!?"[lr]::
39703::$$$message_0339_0042_0001$$$::There is no reply.[lr]::
39704::$$$message_0339_0042_0002$$$::But her body is warm.[lr]::
39705::$$$message_0339_0042_0003$$$::Fuji-nee is unconscious, but she's breathing and doesn't have a single wound.::
39706::$$$message_0339_0043_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39707::$$$message_0339_0043_0001$$$::I sigh with relief.[lr]::
39708::$$$message_0339_0043_0002$$$::"Are you satisfied now? I did promise you, so I shall spare that girl. And...well, I shall let you go as well.[lr]::
39709::$$$message_0339_0043_0003$$$::That spectacle from earlier was so wonderful it made me angry.[lr]::
39710::$$$message_0339_0043_0004$$$::But..."::
39711::$$$message_0339_0044_0000$$$::"...I see. Well, I figured it would be like this."[lr]::
39712::$$$message_0339_0044_0001$$$::"Yes, the fun's over, young lady.[lr]::
39713::$$$message_0339_0044_0002$$$::Now, Saber. Kill Archer's Master.[lr]::
39714::$$$message_0339_0044_0003$$$::If he gets in the way, you can kill the kid that was your Master too."::
39715::$$$message_0339_0045_0000$$$::"Guh... Don't be ridiculous, who would obey you...!?"[lr]::
39716::$$$message_0339_0045_0001$$$::Saber glares at Caster, still on her knees.::
39717::$$$message_0339_0046_0000$$$::"No, you obey me, Saber. You are mine now. You cannot disobey me physically or mentally as long as I have this Command Spell."::
39718::$$$message_0339_0047_0000$$$::"Ah... Guh...!"[lr]::
39719::$$$message_0339_0047_0001$$$::Saber's voice is filled with pain.[lr]::
39720::$$$message_0339_0047_0002$$$::...But, on the other hand...[lr]::
39721::$$$message_0339_0047_0003$$$::Saber's body slowly gets up against her will.::
39722::$$$message_0339_0048_0000$$$::"Ah... Haah...!"[lr]::
39723::$$$message_0339_0048_0001$$$::Saber's body moves.[lr]::
39724::$$$message_0339_0048_0002$$$::She charges towards Tohsaka at the same speed as before,[lr]::
39725::$$$message_0339_0048_0003$$$::and...[lr]::
39726::$$$message_0339_0048_0004$$$::she thrusts her sword.::
39727::$$$message_0339_0049_0000$$$::"Ah... Khh...!"[lr]::
39728::$$$message_0339_0049_0001$$$::I feel a dull pain in my shoulder.[lr]::
39729::$$$message_0339_0049_0002$$$::I feel the steel stabbing into my shoulder.[lr]::
39730::$$$message_0339_0049_0003$$$::Saber's sword that should be invisible emerges faintly with my blood.::
39731::$$$message_0339_0050_0000$$$::"You idiot, why...?"[lr]::
39732::$$$message_0339_0050_0001$$$::I hear Tohsaka's voice from right behind me.[lr]::
39733::$$$message_0339_0050_0002$$$::...But, even if she says that, there's nothing I can do.[lr]::
39734::$$$message_0339_0050_0003$$$::My body just moved on its own, and above all... I didn't want to see Saber attack Tohsaka.[lr]::
39735::$$$message_0339_0050_0004$$$::I didn't want to see it, so I just went in between them.::
39736::$$$message_0339_0051_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
39737::$$$message_0339_0051_0001$$$::My body jumps.[lr]::
39738::$$$message_0339_0051_0002$$$::Saber's sword doesn't stop its force.[lr]::
39739::$$$message_0339_0051_0003$$$::It rips my flesh and scrapes my collarbone.[lr]::
39740::$$$message_0339_0051_0004$$$::The blade will eventually tear the blood vessels in my neck, and I will die.::
39741::$$$message_0339_0052_0000$$$::"Haah, ah...!!!!!"[lr]::
39742::$$$message_0339_0052_0001$$$::That's... Not good.[lr]::
39743::$$$message_0339_0052_0002$$$::I'm still carrying Fuji-nee.[lr]::
39744::$$$message_0339_0052_0003$$$::And Tohsaka is behind me...!::
39745::$$$message_0339_0053_0000$$$::"...That's too bad. What a waste. I was interested in that kid, but..."[lr]::
39746::$$$message_0339_0053_0001$$$::Far away...[lr]::
39747::$$$message_0339_0053_0002$$$::Caster is...saying something.::
39748::$$$message_0339_0054_0000$$$::"Obey the Command Spell, Saber. That'll get rid of two more people if you slash them both."[lr]::
39749::$$$message_0339_0054_0001$$$::A ruthless order.[lr]::
39750::$$$message_0339_0054_0002$$$::Making sounds as if resisting it...[lr]::
39751::$$$message_0339_0054_0003$$$::Saber's arm shakes while stopping.::
39752::$$$message_0339_0055_0000$$$::"Guh...! No way, Saber's Magic Resistance opposes even the binding of the Command Spell...!?"[lr]::
39753::$$$message_0339_0055_0001$$$::Caster is astonished.[lr]::
39754::$$$message_0339_0055_0002$$$::Still looking down, Saber desperately bites her lips and pulls back her sword.::
39755::$$$message_0339_0056_0000$$$::"[line2]un."::
39756::$$$message_0339_0057_0000$$$::A squeezed out whisper.[lr]::
39757::$$$message_0339_0057_0001$$$::Something drips.[lr]::
39758::$$$message_0339_0057_0002$$$::Crying from her downcast face…::
