2782::$$$message_0025_0000_0000$$$::Well, I don't want to complain about this training...[lr]::
2783::$$$message_0025_0000_0001$$$::...but I also think that if there is some sort of secret move I could learn that might let me get through this training, I might be more enthusiastic about sparring against Saber.::
2784::$$$message_0025_0001_0000$$$::"Saber. Hear me out."[lr]::
2785::$$$message_0025_0001_0001$$$::"Yes, what is it, Shirou? You certainly look expectant."::
2786::$$$message_0025_0002_0000$$$::"You think so? Hm, well I guess I want to ask you for a favor, and I have some high hopes for it... But let me get to the point: there's something I want you to teach me."::
2787::$$$message_0025_0003_0000$$$::"Huh. I am not entirely sure what exactly you wish to learn, but I will share what I can with you."::
2788::$$$message_0025_0004_0000$$$::Saber thinks it's a serious conversation, so she sits in front of me in a formal seiza position.::
2789::$$$message_0025_0005_0000$$$::"So what is it that you want to know? Is it about Servants?"[lr]::
2790::$$$message_0025_0005_0001$$$::Saber regards me seriously.::
2791::$$$message_0025_0006_0000$$$::"...Uh."[lr]::
2792::$$$message_0025_0006_0001$$$::I feel like I already know what's going to happen in the next few seconds here, but I should go for broke and ask anyway.::
2793::$$$message_0025_0007_0000$$$::"Um...I'm actually really serious about this, so I want you to hear me out and please not get mad."::
2794::$$$message_0025_0008_0000$$$::"Yes, that is why I mean to listen intently. Please do not hold back. Ask whatever is on your mind."::
2795::$$$message_0025_0009_0000$$$::"Okay, I'm going to take you at your word...[lr]::
2796::$$$message_0025_0009_0001$$$::So...is there some sort of secret technique I could learn that would let me take down a Servant? It'd be great if it were strong enough to take even you down."::
2797::$$$message_0025_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2798::$$$message_0025_0010_0001$$$::Saber stops breathing.::
2799::$$$message_0025_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2800::$$$message_0025_0011_0001$$$::Saber's brow doesn't move so much as a millimeter.::
2801::$$$message_0025_0012_0000$$$::"I-I knew it couldn't be that easy, right?[lr]::
2802::$$$message_0025_0012_0001$$$::Sorry...I apologize... It was my bad! I was only joking, so I would really appreciate if you just understood I was kidding and pretended you didn't hear any of that!"::
2803::$$$message_0025_0013_0000$$$::Just then...[lr]::
2804::$$$message_0025_0013_0001$$$::Saber grins wickedly.::
2805::$$$message_0025_0014_0000$$$::"S-Saber? I might be imagining things, but you seem to have an evil smile on your face that...doesn't quite fit you..."::
2806::$$$message_0025_0015_0000$$$::"Oh it is not your imagination. I am feeling every bit as wicked as Rin right now."::
2807::$$$message_0025_0016_0000$$$::"Aaaah!!!"[lr]::
2808::$$$message_0025_0016_0001$$$::Every hair on my body stands on end.::
2809::$$$message_0025_0017_0000$$$::"Uh...ah...uh..."[lr]::
2810::$$$message_0025_0017_0001$$$::"Why are you so distressed, Shirou? I have not yet answered your question. If I recall correctly, you desire a secret attack powerful enough to defeat a Servant in a single blow, yes?"::
2811::$$$message_0025_0018_0000$$$::I retreat instinctively, but Saber closes the distance between us, not allowing me to escape.::
2812::$$$message_0025_0019_0000$$$::"I...uh, well, you see... Saber, are you mad?"[lr]::
2813::$$$message_0025_0019_0001$$$::"Oh, [font italic=true]very.[font italic=false]"::
2814::$$$message_0025_0020_0000$$$::I am a dead man.[lr]::
2815::$$$message_0025_0020_0001$$$::If Saber and I were actually to fight right now, I'd die.::
2816::$$$message_0025_0021_0000$$$::"...Hold it. Let's calm down, Saber.[lr]::
2817::$$$message_0025_0021_0001$$$::I regret what I said. I have a pretty good idea why you're mad too."[lr]::
2818::$$$message_0025_0021_0002$$$::"Do you, now? Then please, seat yourself there, seiza style. My rage will not abate until I have properly explained everything to you."::
2819::$$$message_0025_0022_0000$$$::Saber gets to her feet.[lr]::
2820::$$$message_0025_0022_0001$$$::I quickly sit up straight, just as Saber had been, and brace myself for the worst.::
2821::$$$message_0025_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2822::$$$message_0025_0023_0001$$$::Saber takes a deep breath.[lr]::
2823::$$$message_0025_0023_0002$$$::And...::
2824::$$$message_0025_0024_0000$$$::"HOW CAN YOU BE SO [font italic=true]RIDICULOUS[font italic=false]!? WHAT WERE YOU [font italic=true]THINKING[font italic=false], ASKING ME TO TEACH YOU SUCH A TECHNIQUE!?"::
2825::$$$message_0025_0025_0000$$$::"Agh... Oof."[lr]::
2826::$$$message_0025_0025_0001$$$::The sheer volume is wreaking havoc on my poor ears.[lr]::
2827::$$$message_0025_0025_0002$$$::I had no idea her yelling alone could paralyze me.[lr]::
2828::$$$message_0025_0025_0003$$$::No human could ever shout so loud.[lr]::
2829::$$$message_0025_0025_0004$$$::It's like the roar of a beast...a lion.::
2830::$$$message_0025_0026_0000$$$::"S-sorry... I said I regret my actions.[lr]::
2831::$$$message_0025_0026_0001$$$::Saber, you're stronger than me. I just thought maybe you knew some kind of sword skill even amateurs could learn."::
2832::$$$message_0025_0027_0000$$$::"No such easy path exists![lr]::
2833::$$$message_0025_0027_0001$$$::An ambush is best used against an opponent with whom you are evenly matched, and amateurs like you must carefully build a foundation before even considering using such a thing!"::
2834::$$$message_0025_0028_0000$$$::"Besides, I have already told you not to think about defeating your opponent! Defending yourself is your first priority! If there is to be a special secret move for you, Shirou, it would be gaining the ability to lead a battle without actually fighting!"::
2835::$$$message_0025_0029_0000$$$::"Ugh...I know. I got it...so can you tone it down a bit?"[lr]::
2836::$$$message_0025_0029_0001$$$::I show her how bad I feel about this, and clap my hands together like I'm praying for her forgiveness.::
2837::$$$message_0025_0030_0000$$$::"Honestly... I thought you had some potential, but then, a moment later, THIS is what you ask me. If you continue like this, it will simply be too dangerous to leave you alone!"[lr]::
2838::$$$message_0025_0030_0001$$$::Saber continues scolding me.::
2839::$$$message_0025_0031_0000$$$::"...Hnn..."[lr]::
2840::$$$message_0025_0031_0001$$$::I stepped on the lion's tail and incurred her wrath.[lr]::
2841::$$$message_0025_0031_0002$$$::I'll just keep my mouth shut and endure Saber's scolding.::
