31531::$$$message_0253_0000_0000$$$::    That's when...[lr]::
31532::$$$message_0253_0000_0001$$$::"Oh. I'm surprised Saber's here."[lr]::
31533::$$$message_0253_0000_0002$$$::On the way out back, we run into that tardy bastard.::
31534::$$$message_0253_0001_0000$$$::"Archer! What took you so damn long!?"[lr]::
31535::$$$message_0253_0001_0001$$$::"It's obvious, right? I rushed over since I sensed my Master's imminent danger. But it seems that I was too late. If Saber is here and Rin is safe, then I assume that everything is over and done?"::
31536::$$$message_0253_0002_0000$$$::"Ugh...! Yeah, everything's over! I'll tell you everything you missed while you were taking your sweet time, so come over here and listen up![lr]::
31537::$$$message_0253_0002_0001$$$::"Just in time for a lecture...this is the worst."::
31538::$$$message_0253_0003_0000$$$::The two of them quarrel, leaving us aside.[lr]::
31539::$$$message_0253_0003_0001$$$::...Well, it's more like Tohsaka is yelling at Archer, while he just calmly brushes it off.::
31540::$$$message_0253_0004_0000$$$::"Those two are close after all, hmm? Rin is angry because she trusts Archer, and Archer is accepting the verbal abuse as a form of apology."::
31541::$$$message_0253_0005_0000$$$::"I get what you're saying. But why are you explaining it to me, Saber?"[lr]::
31542::$$$message_0253_0005_0001$$$::"Well, your expression was complicated and I thought you were perhaps confused."::
31543::$$$message_0253_0006_0000$$$::I don't know what's so funny, but Saber's smiling as if she's figured something out.[lr]::
31544::$$$message_0253_0006_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
31545::$$$message_0253_0006_0002$$$::That makes what I was seeing before even more unpleasant.::
31546::$$$message_0253_0007_0000$$$::"Okay, okay. Next time I won't worry about appearances. So let's say it's good for now.[lr]::
31547::$$$message_0253_0007_0001$$$::So. Which Servant was eliminated?"::
31548::$$$message_0253_0008_0000$$$::Archer's expression changes.[lr]::
31549::$$$message_0253_0008_0001$$$::His usual caustic and laid-back attitude withdraws, and in its place is the rational warrior.::
31550::$$$message_0253_0009_0000$$$::"...The Rider Servant disappeared. We don't know what happened, but she must have been defeated by Caster."[lr]::
31551::$$$message_0253_0009_0001$$$::"By Caster? Then what happened to Caster? Don't tell me she went unwounded."::
31552::$$$message_0253_0010_0000$$$::"I don't know. But Rider was defeated in one blow, so I think Caster's unwounded."[lr]::
31553::$$$message_0253_0010_0001$$$::The three of us were in agreement on that.::
31554::$$$message_0253_0011_0000$$$::...Then...[lr]::
31555::$$$message_0253_0011_0001$$$::"...Humph. What a fool. So she was just all talk.[lr]::
31556::$$$message_0253_0011_0002$$$::I didn't think that she was capable of a win, but getting defeated with one blow? Man, show some spirit, don't go out like a coward."[lr]::
31557::$$$message_0253_0011_0003$$$::He goes back to his usual manner and insults the late Rider.::
31558::$$$message_0253_0012_0000$$$::"...Archer. Rider died protecting her Master. You do not have the right to criticize."::
31559::$$$message_0253_0013_0000$$$::"What, that's what you have to say? A coward's a coward. If she calls herself a hero, then she needs to kill at least one person to save face. Or if she can't do that, at least drag an enemy down with her."::
31560::$$$message_0253_0014_0000$$$::"...How conceited. She was defeated without resistance as she was in a situation where she could not do such a thing. Are you one to call yourself a hero while speaking ill of her death?"::
31561::$$$message_0253_0015_0000$$$::"Heh. Whatever the reason, it makes no difference to the fact that her defeat came ignobly.[lr]::
31562::$$$message_0253_0015_0001$$$::...Well, it was certainly my mistake to say anything about a hero. The weak will die no matter what, hero or not.[lr]::
31563::$$$message_0253_0015_0002$$$::Heroes unfit for war should bow out early."::
31564::$$$message_0253_0016_0000$$$::"...Well said. Then will you fight me, Archer?"::
31565::$$$message_0253_0017_0000$$$::"With you? What a surprise. I don't know what crawled up your ass, but challenging your ally?[lr]::
31566::$$$message_0253_0017_0001$$$::But too bad. I've been ordered with a Command Spell not to fight the two of you.[lr]::
31567::$$$message_0253_0017_0002$$$::Challenge me now, I will only be defeated without resistance just like Rider... Would your chivalry approve of fighting such an opponent, Saber?[lr]::
31568::$$$message_0253_0017_0003$$$::"Mrgh..."::
31569::$$$message_0253_0018_0000$$$::The two glare at each other wordlessly.[lr]::
31570::$$$message_0253_0018_0001$$$::"Stop right there, Archer."[lr]::
31571::$$$message_0253_0018_0002$$$::Tohsaka's quiet but firm order stops them.[lr]::
31572::$$$message_0253_0018_0003$$$::"Mrgh..."::
31573::$$$message_0253_0019_0000$$$::"This is no time to be fighting with Saber.[lr]::
31574::$$$message_0253_0019_0001$$$::Rider disappeared, and one Master was eliminated. But there's no doubt that there is one more unidentified Master hiding at school.[lr]::
31575::$$$message_0253_0019_0002$$$::Our truce lasts until we defeat the Master hiding at our school. Or what? Do you [font italic=true]want[font italic=false] me to use another Command Spell to order you not to fight against Saber?"::
31576::$$$message_0253_0020_0000$$$::"Yeah, okay. Saber was just so adamant about her pretty little ideals that I couldn't help it.[lr]::
31577::$$$message_0253_0020_0001$$$::I'm sorry, Saber. We can fight after this truce is over."::
31578::$$$message_0253_0021_0000$$$::"...No. It was immature of me as well. I will ignore your comment out of respect to Rin."[lr]::
31579::$$$message_0253_0021_0001$$$::Saber takes a step back, still glaring at Archer, and stands by my side.::
31580::$$$message_0253_0022_0000$$$::Tohsaka and Archer also step back to clear the air.::
31581::$$$message_0253_0023_0000$$$::"...Well, that's about it.[lr]::
31582::$$$message_0253_0023_0001$$$::Our truce is still on. It's not possible today anymore, but we can search for Caster's Master at school tomorrow.[lr]::
31583::$$$message_0253_0023_0002$$$::To be clear, we're just maintaining our status quo, but is that okay with you?"::
31584::$$$message_0253_0024_0000$$$::"Yeah, of course. What's the plan after this? Are you going to try to go to Ryudou Temple after all?"::
31585::$$$message_0253_0025_0000$$$::"...Of course not. According to Archer, going to the temple is like suicide. If we want to defeat Caster, we'll have to search for her Master first.[lr]::
31586::$$$message_0253_0025_0001$$$::For better or worse, Caster's Master seems to be coming to school daily. Instead of doing something on our end and having them on guard, we should just let them continue."::
31587::$$$message_0253_0026_0000$$$::"...Mm?"[lr]::
31588::$$$message_0253_0026_0001$$$::I try to think of how she came to that conclusion.[lr]::
31589::$$$message_0253_0026_0002$$$::Tohsaka had noticed that there was another Master at school.[lr]::
31590::$$$message_0253_0026_0003$$$::That must be because there's someone with magical energy other than Shinji.::
31591::$$$message_0253_0027_0000$$$::Since Caster appeared during everything, the Master hiding at our school would be Caster's Master.[lr]::
31592::$$$message_0253_0027_0001$$$::So, Caster's Master is coming to school for some reason.[lr]::
31593::$$$message_0253_0027_0002$$$::It means that instead of staying at Ryudou Temple under Caster's protection, they are coming to school, defenseless.::
31594::$$$message_0253_0028_0000$$$::"...In other words, after we find out who the Master is, we attack them before they go back to the temple?"[lr]::
31595::$$$message_0253_0028_0001$$$::"Yup. It seems like Caster's Master doesn't know that we're Masters.[lr]::
31596::$$$message_0253_0028_0002$$$::If they knew, they wouldn't come to school, right?"::
31597::$$$message_0253_0029_0000$$$::"Oh... Yeah, that's true. Then Caster's Master didn't know Shinji was a Master either, huh?"::
31598::$$$message_0253_0030_0000$$$::"...I can't come up with an explanation, but there's a high possibility. Such a crazy thing doesn't seem possible, what with how good their Servant is with magecraft."::
31599::$$$message_0253_0031_0000$$$::...Right.[lr]::
31600::$$$message_0253_0031_0001$$$::Even I, who has no knowledge as a Master, got this far thanks to Saber.[lr]::
31601::$$$message_0253_0031_0002$$$::If you have a Servant like Caster, I'm sure you wouldn't be so reckless as to go out.::
31602::$$$message_0253_0032_0000$$$::"That's wrong. Your entire premise is wrong, Rin."[lr]::
31603::$$$message_0253_0032_0001$$$::"Archer...?"::
31604::$$$message_0253_0033_0000$$$::"I don't think Caster's Master has free will.[lr]::
31605::$$$message_0253_0033_0001$$$::...Well, I think the Master believes he has free will when in fact, he's being controlled by Caster. That woman is not someone to willingly suffer others. She would defy the very concept of a Master and be the one puppeteering them."::
31606::$$$message_0253_0034_0000$$$::"...Caster's Master, a puppet?[lr]::
31607::$$$message_0253_0034_0001$$$::Like, they're being tricked by Caster or had their memory of being a Master removed?"::
31608::$$$message_0253_0035_0000$$$::"Hm... Perhaps, it would be something if the Master isn't even aware of the situation.[lr]::
31609::$$$message_0253_0035_0001$$$::Originally, a Servant cannot do anything to a Master.[lr]::
31610::$$$message_0253_0035_0002$$$::The Servant cannot exist if they kill their Master.[lr]::
31611::$$$message_0253_0035_0003$$$::On the other hand, Masters have Command Spells. If the Servant disobeys, the Master can kill the Servant.[lr]::
31612::$$$message_0253_0035_0004$$$::...In that case, it is safer to trick your Master than to kill him."::
31613::$$$message_0253_0036_0000$$$::Tohsaka ponders on that.[lr]::
31614::$$$message_0253_0036_0001$$$::But I'm not convinced.::
31615::$$$message_0253_0037_0000$$$::"Really? Caster's been doing a lot of evil deeds, right? Is it possible for her to hide all that from her Master?[lr]::
31616::$$$message_0253_0037_0001$$$::Wouldn't the Master be more on guard the stronger the Servant is?"::
31617::$$$message_0253_0038_0000$$$::"That's not a problem. She can make any convenient excuse if her Master is an incredibly and stupidly good-natured person. Caster's Master may be like that as well."::
31618::$$$message_0253_0039_0000$$$::"...Hey. Don't look at me like that."[lr]::
31619::$$$message_0253_0039_0001$$$::"What, I can't help it if a prime example is right here. The possibility that Caster's Master is a stupid person is not zero."[lr]::
31620::$$$message_0253_0039_0002$$$::"I see. You have a point, Archer."[lr]::
31621::$$$message_0253_0039_0003$$$::...Hey.[lr]::
31622::$$$message_0253_0039_0004$$$::Why are you agreeing with him, Saber?::
31623::$$$message_0253_0040_0000$$$::"...Okay, I got it.[lr]::
31624::$$$message_0253_0040_0001$$$::No matter what kind of person Caster's Master may be, there's a high possibility that they will come to school tomorrow.[lr]::
31625::$$$message_0253_0040_0002$$$::We'll continue investigating the school. And we'll attack Caster's Master as soon as we find them. Sound good?"::
31626::$$$message_0253_0041_0000$$$::"...Well, that seems like a reasonable course of action, but how are we going to look for them?"[lr]::
31627::$$$message_0253_0041_0001$$$::"That'll be today's homework. We'll both go home and think about it.[lr]::
31628::$$$message_0253_0041_0002$$$::Either way, you and Saber are tired, right? I don't want you two collapsing, so we should call it a day."::
31629::$$$message_0253_0042_0000$$$::"Huh? No, I'm not that tired.[lr]::
31630::$$$message_0253_0042_0001$$$::It's still early, so we can still... H-hey, Tohsaka!?"::
31631::$$$message_0253_0043_0000$$$::"...Just do as I say. Either way, we can't get into school right now, and we have zero clues. There's nothing we can do here... And most of all, haven't you realized that Archer's acting strange...!?[lr]::
31632::$$$message_0253_0043_0001$$$::After what happened between you two yesterday, things aren't gonna settle down at this rate!"::
31633::$$$message_0253_0044_0000$$$::"Ugh, f-fine. I'll go home, so..."[lr]::
31634::$$$message_0253_0044_0001$$$::Don't get so close and whisper like that!::
31635::$$$message_0253_0045_0000$$$::"...Then, I'll see you tomorrow. I don't think it'll happen again, but be careful at night. I won't forgive you if you get taken away by Caster again."[lr]::
31636::$$$message_0253_0045_0001$$$::"Ugh... All right, all right, I'm going home!"::
31637::$$$message_0253_0046_0000$$$::"...Hmph. Also, good work today. I'll acknowledge you as a proper Master just for today."[lr]::
31638::$$$message_0253_0046_0001$$$::   Tohsaka hops back.::
31639::$$$message_0253_0047_0000$$$::"Let's go, Archer! You're going to explain yourself to me in detail once we're back home!"[lr]::
31640::$$$message_0253_0047_0001$$$::"Oh, I knew it. There's no way I'd be off the hook that easy."[lr]::
31641::$$$message_0253_0047_0002$$$::"...Hey, you. Do I really have to knock some sense into that skull of yours once and for all?"::
31642::$$$message_0253_0048_0000$$$::Tohsaka and Archer leave, complaining all the while.::
31643::$$$message_0253_0049_0000$$$::"Let's go home, too. I am a bit tired, so we should eat dinner early today."[lr]::
31644::$$$message_0253_0049_0001$$$::"That sounds good. I support that idea, Shirou."[lr]::
31645::$$$message_0253_0049_0002$$$::We leave the woods, trying not to be seen.::
31646::$$$message_0253_0050_0000$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
31647::$$$message_0253_0050_0001$$$::I'll pull myself together, go buy ingredients in the shopping district, make a big dinner, and rest my mind and body.[lr]::
31648::$$$message_0253_0050_0002$$$::We can discuss Caster and her Master after that.::
