50564::$$$message_0436_0000_0000$$$::After making a full round of the house,[lr]::
50565::$$$message_0436_0000_0001$$$::Saber is nowhere to be found. I even checked the detached guest rooms, but I can't find her.::
50566::$$$message_0436_0001_0000$$$::"That's weird. That armor isn't exactly camouflage..."[lr]::
50567::$$$message_0436_0001_0001$$$::Even so, a fully armed and armored Saber still eludes me.[lr]::
50568::$$$message_0436_0001_0002$$$::Supposedly Servants can turn into spirit forms, but unfortunately she can't with me.[lr]::
50569::$$$message_0436_0001_0003$$$::No, first of all...::
50570::$$$message_0436_0002_0000$$$::"Even though I'm called a Master, I don't know anything about her."[lr]::
50571::$$$message_0436_0002_0001$$$::I don't even know what Saber is or how Servants are able to exist.::
50572::$$$message_0436_0003_0000$$$::The one thing I do know is...[lr]::
50573::$$$message_0436_0003_0001$$$::I feel I can get through this strange battle as long as I'm with this golden-haired knight.::
50574::$$$message_0436_0004_0000$$$::"She's not here either..."[lr]::
50575::$$$message_0436_0004_0001$$$::I've looked around the entire house.[lr]::
50576::$$$message_0436_0004_0002$$$::It's the size of a traditional Japanese inn, but I played hide-and-seek with Fuji-nee when I was a kid, so I know the most efficient way to search it.[lr]::
50577::$$$message_0436_0004_0003$$$::She must be in the dojo or the shed if she isn't in the house itself.::
50578::$$$message_0436_0005_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
50579::$$$message_0436_0005_0001$$$::Saber is in the still, silent dojo.[lr]::
50580::$$$message_0436_0005_0002$$$::...But, her appearance is different from yesterday.[lr]::
50581::$$$message_0436_0005_0003$$$::Saber is sitting upright, her legs tucked beneath herself, on the wooden floor. She's not wearing her armor.[lr]::
50582::$$$message_0436_0005_0004$$$::She changed into rather elegant clothes that really suit her. Now she sits in wait.::
50583::$$$message_0436_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50584::$$$message_0436_0006_0001$$$::...Words fail me at the sight.[lr]::
50585::$$$message_0436_0006_0002$$$::Saber looks beautiful. She strikes a refined, dignified figure as she sits there, eyes closed.[lr]::
50586::$$$message_0436_0006_0003$$$::She seems to almost merge with the silence, like nothing so much as still water.::
50587::$$$message_0436_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50588::$$$message_0436_0007_0001$$$::And that rids me of any further doubt in my mind.[lr]::
50589::$$$message_0436_0007_0002$$$::Servant or whatever it is, she seems sacrosanct. [lr]::
50590::$$$message_0436_0007_0003$$$::So... From now on, I'm sure I won't go down the wrong path.::
50591::$$$message_0436_0008_0000$$$::"Saber."[lr]::
50592::$$$message_0436_0008_0001$$$::I call to her.[lr]::
50593::$$$message_0436_0008_0002$$$::Saber calmly opens her eyes and meets my gaze.::
50594::$$$message_0436_0009_0000$$$::"You are awake, Shirou."[lr]::
50595::$$$message_0436_0009_0001$$$::Her voice is serene.[lr]::
50596::$$$message_0436_0009_0002$$$::Something rich and calm about her voice hangs in the air.::
50597::$$$message_0436_0010_0000$$$::"Yeah, I just woke up. What are you doing here?"[lr]::
50598::$$$message_0436_0010_0001$$$::"I was resting. Since I cannot treat you, I figured that I would at least ensure that my body is in as perfect a condition as I can make it."::
50599::$$$message_0436_0011_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
50600::$$$message_0436_0011_0001$$$::Saber gives a straightforward response as she scrutinizes me.[lr]::
50601::$$$message_0436_0011_0002$$$::...This is, um...[lr]::
50602::$$$message_0436_0011_0003$$$::Making me nervous in a different way than Tohsaka did.::
50603::$$$message_0436_0012_0000$$$::"Shirou? What is it? Is your body still...?"[lr]::
50604::$$$message_0436_0012_0001$$$::"N-no, I'm totally fine...! It's something else, really, it's nothing...!"[lr]::
50605::$$$message_0436_0012_0002$$$::I quickly take a step back and shake my head.::
50606::$$$message_0436_0013_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
50607::$$$message_0436_0013_0001$$$::Looking away from Saber[line2]who tilts her head at me quizzically[line2]I try to calm my rapid heartbeat.::
50608::$$$message_0436_0014_0000$$$::"Get a hold of yourself! Why are you getting worked up like this...!"[lr]::
50609::$$$message_0436_0014_0001$$$::I take a deep breath.[lr]::
50610::$$$message_0436_0014_0002$$$::...But I don't think this feeling is going away anytime soon.::
50611::$$$message_0436_0015_0000$$$::"...Man, why did she have to change...?"[lr]::
50612::$$$message_0436_0015_0001$$$::I can't help myself.[lr]::
50613::$$$message_0436_0015_0002$$$::With Saber in that outfit, I can't help but actually think she's real now. ::
50614::$$$message_0436_0016_0000$$$::...Seriously, she's drop-dead gorgeous.[lr]::
50615::$$$message_0436_0016_0001$$$::I mean I saw that yesterday, but it's actually setting in now.::
50616::$$$message_0436_0017_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
50617::$$$message_0436_0017_0001$$$::As soon as we make eye contact, I can feel my nervousness grow.[lr]::
50618::$$$message_0436_0017_0002$$$::Then again, I wasn't looking everywhere for her just to stay silent.[lr]::
50619::$$$message_0436_0017_0003$$$::It's uncomfortable, but I can't let it be awkward forever.::
50620::$$$message_0436_0018_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
50621::$$$message_0436_0018_0001$$$::I bite the bullet.[lr]::
50622::$$$message_0436_0018_0002$$$::I should've asked her yesterday anyway.[lr]::
50623::$$$message_0436_0018_0003$$$::If she really is my Servant...[lr]::
50624::$$$message_0436_0018_0004$$$::And if I...really am going to participate in this battle.::
