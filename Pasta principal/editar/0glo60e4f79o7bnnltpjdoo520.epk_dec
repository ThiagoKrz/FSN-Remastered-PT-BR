37308::$$$message_0317_0000_0000$$$::The sound was like hitting steel.[lr]::
37309::$$$message_0317_0000_0001$$$::"Haah... Haah... Haah... Haah...!"[lr]::
37310::$$$message_0317_0000_0002$$$::He arrived there still breathing heavily.[lr]::
37311::$$$message_0317_0000_0003$$$::His footsteps are loud and their rhythm is erratic.[lr]::
37312::$$$message_0317_0000_0004$$$::Staggering forward, he leaves the door flung wide open. He can hardly stay on his feet, pulled forward only by his falling body.::
37313::$$$message_0317_0001_0000$$$::He looks around.[lr]::
37314::$$$message_0317_0001_0001$$$::The church is empty after morning service.[lr]::
37315::$$$message_0317_0001_0002$$$::Light is only provided by the sun streaking through the windows above.[lr]::
37316::$$$message_0317_0001_0003$$$::The silence creates a solemn air, and the still atmosphere creates a profound stillness.[lr]::
37317::$$$message_0317_0001_0004$$$::His very presence is heresy.::
37318::$$$message_0317_0002_0000$$$::"Ah... Haah... Haah...!"[lr]::
37319::$$$message_0317_0002_0001$$$::   No, that would be wrong.[lr]::
37320::$$$message_0317_0002_0002$$$::He did not merely come to this place.[lr]::
37321::$$$message_0317_0002_0003$$$::With ragged breath and unfocused eyes...[lr]::
37322::$$$message_0317_0002_0004$$$::With shaking limbs that wither and sway...[lr]::
37323::$$$message_0317_0002_0005$$$::He desperately fled for shelter.[lr]::
37324::$$$message_0317_0002_0006$$$::That is the true answer.[lr]::
37325::$$$message_0317_0002_0007$$$::His wretchedness is that of prey fleeing from a predatory hound.::
37326::$$$message_0317_0003_0000$$$::"It has been six days since the war started. You are the first person to come here."[lr]::
37327::$$$message_0317_0003_0001$$$::"Ungh...!"[lr]::
37328::$$$message_0317_0003_0002$$$::He forces his body upright.[lr]::
37329::$$$message_0317_0003_0003$$$::Just when did this man appear?[lr]::
37330::$$$message_0317_0003_0004$$$::With bloodshot eyes, he peers at the priest standing at the altar and mutters incoherently. ::
37331::$$$message_0317_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
37332::$$$message_0317_0004_0001$$$::The priest frowns.[lr]::
37333::$$$message_0317_0004_0002$$$::He could not fully understand the boy, but assumes he is here to ask for help.[lr]::
37334::$$$message_0317_0004_0003$$$::He wants protection.[lr]::
37335::$$$message_0317_0004_0004$$$::The Master who lost his Servant may ask for protection under the condition that he withdraws from the war. [lr]::
37336::$$$message_0317_0004_0005$$$::That place of refuge, the last sanctuary, is this church.[lr]::
37337::$$$message_0317_0004_0006$$$::And the master of this place, Kirei Kotomine, is the priest.::
37338::$$$message_0317_0005_0000$$$::"...So you will withdraw from the war, boy?"[lr]::
37339::$$$message_0317_0005_0001$$$::The boy responds to that solemn voice with a sparking flame.[lr]::
37340::$$$message_0317_0005_0002$$$::"O-of course! Are you telling me to die...!?[lr]::
37341::$$$message_0317_0005_0003$$$::Look, I can't kill anyone without my Servant, so I don't wanna be a Master...! I-I'm a normal person. I'm a victim, right!? It's unfair for anyone to kill someone like me...!"::
37342::$$$message_0317_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
37343::$$$message_0317_0006_0001$$$::The priest does not answer and only looks at the intruder.[lr]::
37344::$$$message_0317_0006_0002$$$::He looks beyond the boy.[lr]::
37345::$$$message_0317_0006_0003$$$::As if to peer beneath the skin, bone, and sinew to that which lies beneath.::
37346::$$$message_0317_0007_0000$$$::"...What? You got a problem?"[lr]::
37347::$$$message_0317_0007_0001$$$::"I do not have any opinions. You are the first person to withdraw this time, and the first user of this church since it has started. I shall welcome you in the stead of my father, as the overseer of the war."[lr]::
37348::$$$message_0317_0007_0002$$$::"Huh? What, so I'm the only one to quit? Fucking hell, what a nightmare. I don't know what my grandfather will say if he hears of it.[lr]::
37349::$$$message_0317_0007_0003$$$:: Ugh, this is all your guys' fault...! It's so unfair I got a piece of shit like Rider!"::
37350::$$$message_0317_0008_0000$$$::He pounds his fist into the floor in a rage.[lr]::
37351::$$$message_0317_0008_0001$$$::The sound echoes like a bell, and the priest smiles with great interest.::
37352::$$$message_0317_0009_0000$$$::"So Rider was useless, then?"[lr]::
37353::$$$message_0317_0009_0001$$$::"That's right! ...What the hell, she was only talk.[lr]::
37354::$$$message_0317_0009_0002$$$::She died so easily even though I helped her that much. Any other Servant would've been way more useful!"[lr]::
37355::$$$message_0317_0009_0003$$$::"..."::
37356::$$$message_0317_0010_0000$$$::"...Yeah. Even then, I still did well. I did just as my grandfather told me, and everything was set![lr]::
37357::$$$message_0317_0010_0001$$$::But they all got in my way...! It was two against one. There was no way I could've won against that.[lr]::
37358::$$$message_0317_0010_0002$$$::...That's right, it wasn't my fault that I lost.[lr]::
37359::$$$message_0317_0010_0003$$$::It was just the difference in the quality of our Servants. But... they were so smug about it...!!!"::
37360::$$$message_0317_0011_0000$$$::And then he squirms on the ground.[lr]::
37361::$$$message_0317_0011_0001$$$::He strikes the floor bitterly, laments his misfortune, and obsesses over his obstacles.[lr]::
37362::$$$message_0317_0011_0002$$$::But his resentful voice dissipates quickly.[lr]::
37363::$$$message_0317_0011_0003$$$::Hatred of such a level cannot break the silence of this church.::
37364::$$$message_0317_0012_0000$$$::"Damn...damn, damn, damn, damn...!"[lr]::
37365::$$$message_0317_0012_0001$$$::He repeats his cries of agony.[lr]::
37366::$$$message_0317_0012_0002$$$::In the midst of it...[lr]::
37367::$$$message_0317_0012_0003$$$::Footsteps.[lr]::
37368::$$$message_0317_0012_0004$$$::The priest's steps echo through the room as if they were shattering the frozen air.::
37369::$$$message_0317_0013_0000$$$::The father slowly puts his hand on the child's shoulder.[lr]::
37370::$$$message_0317_0013_0001$$$::"...So.[lr]::
37371::$$$message_0317_0013_0002$$$::That means you still have the will to fight?"[lr]::
37372::$$$message_0317_0013_0003$$$::He looks down at the loser and says so with a gentle voice.::
37373::$$$message_0317_0014_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
37374::$$$message_0317_0014_0001$$$::He cannot understand the priest's words.[lr]::
37375::$$$message_0317_0014_0002$$$::The clergy in black has a polite smile on his face.[lr]::
37376::$$$message_0317_0014_0003$$$::"You are in luck. I happen to have one Servant who is available right now."[lr]::
37377::$$$message_0317_0014_0004$$$::The priest offers a new salvation, barely able to restrain a rapturous joy.::
