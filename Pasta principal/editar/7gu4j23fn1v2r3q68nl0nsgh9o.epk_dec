69190::$$$message_0638_0000_0000$$$::Both hands on the clock point to the top.[lr]::
69191::$$$message_0638_0000_0001$$$::It's midnight, the time we agreed on.::
69192::$$$message_0638_0001_0000$$$::I wrap up the Azoth Blade and keep it on my waist.[lr]::
69193::$$$message_0638_0001_0001$$$::It's my only weapon. The only other thing I take with me is the pendant Tohsaka talked about.::
69194::$$$message_0638_0002_0000$$$::"Shirou, Rin's calling for you. She said she'll be waiting outside, so come when you're ready."[lr]::
69195::$$$message_0638_0002_0001$$$::Illya will stay here.[lr]::
69196::$$$message_0638_0002_0002$$$::It's true that Zouken's targeting Illya, but it's also my wish for her to stay here.::
69197::$$$message_0638_0003_0000$$$::"All right. Tohsaka's waiting outside for me?"[lr]::
69198::$$$message_0638_0003_0001$$$::"Yeah. She looked impatient, so you'd better go or she'll start grumbling."::
69199::$$$message_0638_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
69200::$$$message_0638_0004_0001$$$::I nod at Illya and stand up.[lr]::
69201::$$$message_0638_0004_0002$$$::My left arm doesn't hurt anymore.[lr]::
69202::$$$message_0638_0004_0003$$$::My functions as a living creature are just slowly being eroded.::
69203::$$$message_0638_0005_0000$$$::If I stop, I won't know what I'm doing.[lr]::
69204::$$$message_0638_0005_0001$$$::"I'm going, then. Take care, Illya."[lr]::
69205::$$$message_0638_0005_0002$$$::"Good luck, Shirou. Come home with Sakura and Rin before dawn, okay?"[lr]::
69206::$$$message_0638_0005_0003$$$::I wave at Illya and leave the room.::
69207::$$$message_0638_0006_0000$$$::   The air rumbles.[lr]::
69208::$$$message_0638_0006_0001$$$::The pressure of it is enough to crush the spirit of any who enter.[lr]::
69209::$$$message_0638_0006_0002$$$::Is the wind blowing, up in the sky?[lr]::
69210::$$$message_0638_0006_0003$$$::I crane my neck to listen, and hear howling wind.::
69211::$$$message_0638_0007_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
69212::$$$message_0638_0007_0001$$$::...I know this air.[lr]::
69213::$$$message_0638_0007_0002$$$::It's the same as ten years ago.[lr]::
69214::$$$message_0638_0007_0003$$$::You don't need to be a mage to sense the ominous feeling of countless curses suffusing the air .::
69215::$$$message_0638_0008_0000$$$::"This feeling... Is Sakura at Ryudou Temple, halfway up the mountain?"[lr]::
69216::$$$message_0638_0008_0001$$$::"No, we're not going to the temple. The compound up top was built just for show, for the benefit of Masters seeking the Holy Grail.[lr]::
69217::$$$message_0638_0008_0002$$$::...If you want to go to the source of the Holy Grail War, you need to go down to find the Greater Grail."::
69218::$$$message_0638_0009_0000$$$::...The forest is dark.[lr]::
69219::$$$message_0638_0009_0001$$$::We navigate our way into the mountains, using the light of the moon peeking through the clouds.::
69220::$$$message_0638_0010_0000$$$::We push our way through the trees, walking through the night.[lr]::
69221::$$$message_0638_0010_0001$$$::There aren't even any game trails out here, and we mostly have to drop down small cliffs and rock walls.::
69222::$$$message_0638_0011_0000$$$::"Mm... I think Illya said it's around here... Shirou, do you see anything that looks like an entrance?"[lr]::
69223::$$$message_0638_0011_0001$$$::"That looks like an entrance?"::
69224::$$$message_0638_0012_0000$$$::"Any crevices that a person might fit through, or any suspicious shrines. It's supposed to be an entrance, so I don't think it'll be a pitfall."[lr]::
69225::$$$message_0638_0012_0001$$$::"...Don't be ridiculous. You think I can see in the forest at night just because the stars are out?"::
69226::$$$message_0638_0013_0000$$$::...Oh. I can see pretty well, actually.[lr]::
69227::$$$message_0638_0013_0001$$$::There are withered trees all around us. Maybe we're behind Ryudou Temple now.[lr]::
69228::$$$message_0638_0013_0002$$$::Of course, there are no manmade buildings in sight. All I see are the dead trees and a bubbling brook.::
69229::$$$message_0638_0014_0000$$$::"...A stream?"[lr]::
69230::$$$message_0638_0014_0001$$$::Wait.[lr]::
69231::$$$message_0638_0014_0002$$$::That means the water must be coming from somewhere.::
69232::$$$message_0638_0015_0000$$$::"Stop. Hold on, I'm going to take a look at something."[lr]::
69233::$$$message_0638_0015_0001$$$::I squint, following the sound of water.[lr]::
69234::$$$message_0638_0015_0002$$$::...The stream isn't flowing from up the mountain, but from a patch of earth covered in rocks.::
69235::$$$message_0638_0016_0000$$$::It's dark and I can't see it well, but the rocks are big.[lr]::
69236::$$$message_0638_0016_0001$$$::The piles of rocks feel like a natural gate, and I think the water is coming from in there...::
69237::$$$message_0638_0017_0000$$$::"Looks like a cave... It might be a dead end, but maybe..."[lr]::
69238::$$$message_0638_0017_0001$$$::"What? Did you find something?"[lr]::
69239::$$$message_0638_0017_0002$$$::"Yeah. I'm going to check it out. Over here, Tohsaka. Watch your step; the slope is pretty steep."::
69240::$$$message_0638_0018_0000$$$::We descend to the stream.[lr]::
69241::$$$message_0638_0018_0001$$$::It turned out to be only a spring, rather than a river.::
69242::$$$message_0638_0019_0000$$$::It's flowing from several piles of rocks, and we finally come across an opening that one person can fit through.[lr]::
69243::$$$message_0638_0019_0001$$$::The rocks remind me of igloos.[lr]::
69244::$$$message_0638_0019_0002$$$::When I go inside, I nearly run into a big stone, and it doesn't look big enough to fit a person.::
69245::$$$message_0638_0020_0000$$$::"There's a horizontal opening...but this is a dead end. The water looks like it's coming out of the rocks."[lr]::
69246::$$$message_0638_0020_0001$$$::"No, this is the right place. Try touching the rock furthest in the back. You'll be able to slip through easily."::
69247::$$$message_0638_0021_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
69248::$$$message_0638_0021_0001$$$::I do as she says and place my hand on the dark stone.[lr]::
69249::$$$message_0638_0021_0002$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
69250::$$$message_0638_0021_0003$$$::My palm sinks through the surface and feels empty air instead of cool stone.::
69251::$$$message_0638_0022_0000$$$::"Wow. Is this some kind of illusion?"[lr]::
69252::$$$message_0638_0022_0001$$$::"A Bounded Field, probably. Let's keep going."[lr]::
69253::$$$message_0638_0022_0002$$$::Tohsaka presses further into the gloom without turning back.::
69254::$$$message_0638_0023_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
69255::$$$message_0638_0023_0001$$$::This is the point of no return. We're in enemy territory now.[lr]::
69256::$$$message_0638_0023_0002$$$::I quietly take a deep breath and follow Tohsaka.::
69257::$$$message_0638_0024_0000$$$::I make scraping sounds on the stone.[lr]::
69258::$$$message_0638_0024_0001$$$::I feel my way forward with my hands on the wet ground.[lr]::
69259::$$$message_0638_0024_0002$$$::The ground begins to slope dramatically.::
69260::$$$message_0638_0025_0000$$$::...It's tight and claustrophobic in the darkness.[lr]::
69261::$$$message_0638_0025_0001$$$::I'll tumble down into the infinite darkness unless I slowly go down on my back.::
69262::$$$message_0638_0026_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
69263::$$$message_0638_0026_0001$$$::In the dark, I make a slow descent, sprawled on the angled rock.[lr]::
69264::$$$message_0638_0026_0002$$$::...The way ahead is dark, and I can't tell how far down this goes.[lr]::
69265::$$$message_0638_0026_0003$$$::I can only hear my breathing.::
69266::$$$message_0638_0027_0000$$$::"Shirou. Let me ask you this while I can."[lr]::
69267::$$$message_0638_0027_0001$$$::Then,[lr]::
69268::$$$message_0638_0027_0002$$$::Tohsaka suddenly talks to me from ahead.::
69269::$$$message_0638_0028_0000$$$::"What is it?"[lr]::
69270::$$$message_0638_0028_0001$$$::"The Jeweled Sword. How did you make it?"[lr]::
69271::$$$message_0638_0028_0002$$$::Her tone is bored, like she's making small talk to kill time because she's tired of climbing down.::
69272::$$$message_0638_0029_0000$$$::"How? Why are you asking?"[lr]::
69273::$$$message_0638_0029_0001$$$::"Because. I said I was going to kill Sakura.[lr]::
69274::$$$message_0638_0029_0002$$$::Are you okay with giving me a weapon to do it?"[lr]::
69275::$$$message_0638_0029_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
69276::$$$message_0638_0029_0004$$$::I nod in the dark.[lr]::
69277::$$$message_0638_0029_0005$$$::Tohsaka's right, of course.::
69278::$$$message_0638_0030_0000$$$::"I'm not okay with it. But I can't save Sakura without you, and we have a better chance together than alone.[lr]::
69279::$$$message_0638_0030_0001$$$::...Plus, I promised you that I'd Project the sword.[lr]::
69280::$$$message_0638_0030_0002$$$::I already broke one promise to you. I didn't want to break another."::
69281::$$$message_0638_0031_0000$$$::It was quite a while ago.[lr]::
69282::$$$message_0638_0031_0001$$$::After I lost Saber, I asked Tohsaka for help.[lr]::
69283::$$$message_0638_0031_0002$$$::She helped me, and I made her a promise: ::
69284::$$$message_0638_0032_0000$$$::I would make her win.[lr]::
69285::$$$message_0638_0032_0001$$$::I promised to make Tohsaka the victor of the Holy Grail War.::
69286::$$$message_0638_0033_0000$$$::...I can't keep that promise anymore.[lr]::
69287::$$$message_0638_0033_0001$$$::So, I want to at least keep my other promise.[lr]::
69288::$$$message_0638_0033_0002$$$::At that time...[lr]::
69289::$$$message_0638_0033_0003$$$::For Rin Tohsaka, the girl I liked at the time, who believed in me when I had nothing left.::
69290::$$$message_0638_0034_0000$$$::"Okay. You're a stickler for these things, huh?"[lr]::
69291::$$$message_0638_0034_0001$$$::"Yeah. Not as much as you are, though."[lr]::
69292::$$$message_0638_0034_0002$$$::The darkness goes still again.[lr]::
69293::$$$message_0638_0034_0003$$$::Our conversation ends there.[lr]::
69294::$$$message_0638_0034_0004$$$::We don't look at each other. We just stoically descend into the infernal depths.::
69295::$$$message_0638_0035_0000$$$::Our long path seems to take us through the underworld itself.[lr]::
69296::$$$message_0638_0035_0001$$$::It's a winding path, and my body feels like it's walked more than a hundred meters.[lr]::
69297::$$$message_0638_0035_0002$$$::We turn to find ourselves facing a dark cavern.::
69298::$$$message_0638_0036_0000$$$::The one-man-wide path becomes an ever deeper passage.[lr]::
69299::$$$message_0638_0036_0001$$$::We don't need any illumination.[lr]::
69300::$$$message_0638_0036_0002$$$::Some sort of luminescent moss suffuses the cavern with a green glow.::
69301::$$$message_0638_0037_0000$$$::The passage teems with life energy.[lr]::
69302::$$$message_0638_0037_0001$$$::It feels so raw.[lr]::
69303::$$$message_0638_0037_0002$$$::It's an air of birthing, filled with vitality, that seems to celebrate life.[lr]::
69304::$$$message_0638_0037_0003$$$::Abundant od and flowing mana, as far as the eye can see.::
69305::$$$message_0638_0038_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
69306::$$$message_0638_0038_0001$$$::It's so raw that it makes me nauseous.[lr]::
69307::$$$message_0638_0038_0002$$$::The warmth of radiant life is so filthy I want to turn away from it.::
69308::$$$message_0638_0039_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
69309::$$$message_0638_0039_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
69310::$$$message_0638_0039_0002$$$::I have nothing to say.[lr]::
69311::$$$message_0638_0039_0003$$$::This is a land of death.[lr]::
69312::$$$message_0638_0039_0004$$$::Talking to Tohsaka would lower my guard enough to get me killed.::
69313::$$$message_0638_0040_0000$$$::"...Let's go. From here on out, prioritize your own life."[lr]::
69314::$$$message_0638_0040_0001$$$::Tohsaka goes deeper down the passage towards the source of the dark air.::
69315::$$$message_0638_0041_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
69316::$$$message_0638_0041_0001$$$::I see something red on the ground.[lr]::
69317::$$$message_0638_0041_0002$$$::These are unmistakably bloodstains.[lr]::
69318::$$$message_0638_0041_0003$$$::The blood spatter continues into the cave.::
69319::$$$message_0638_0042_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
69320::$$$message_0638_0042_0001$$$::Did someone get here before us?[lr]::
69321::$$$message_0638_0042_0002$$$::Were they wounded so badly that they bled everywhere they walked?::
69322::$$$message_0638_0043_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
69323::$$$message_0638_0043_0001$$$::"...Sorry. I'll be right there."[lr]::
69324::$$$message_0638_0043_0002$$$::I shake off the premonitions and keep walking.[lr]::
69325::$$$message_0638_0043_0003$$$::I can't afford to worry about anyone else now.::
69326::$$$message_0638_0044_0000$$$::"Nrgh..."[lr]::
69327::$$$message_0638_0044_0001$$$::If I lose focus, my mind will shut off.[lr]::
69328::$$$message_0638_0044_0002$$$::Worrying about extra things could erase me entirely.[lr]::
69329::$$$message_0638_0044_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
69330::$$$message_0638_0044_0004$$$::I grip the pendant tightly in my right hand.[lr]::
69331::$$$message_0638_0044_0005$$$::I use the pain to remind myself who I am, and step into the verdant dark.::
69332::$$$message_0638_0045_0000$$$::   A tepid breeze caresses my cheeks.::
69333::$$$message_0638_0046_0000$$$::We come to the end of the passage, which opens into a larger cavern.[lr]::
69334::$$$message_0638_0046_0001$$$::It's as wide as the school grounds.[lr]::
69335::$$$message_0638_0046_0002$$$::I can't see the ceiling in the murk, but it could be as high as ten meters.::
69336::$$$message_0638_0047_0000$$$::There are no signs of life.[lr]::
69337::$$$message_0638_0047_0001$$$::The forgotten underground wasteland reminds me of the pictures of the moon's surface I saw in books, long ago.[lr]::
69338::$$$message_0638_0047_0002$$$::There...[lr]::
69339::$$$message_0638_0047_0003$$$::stands Saber, waiting for us.[lr]::
69340::$$$message_0638_0047_0004$$$::She's the only one in the cave.[lr]::
69341::$$$message_0638_0047_0005$$$::I don't see Sakura, Zouken, or Assassin.[lr]::
69342::$$$message_0638_0047_0006$$$::Only the darkened swordswoman blocks our path.::
69343::$$$message_0638_0048_0000$$$::"...Saber."[lr]::
69344::$$$message_0638_0048_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
69345::$$$message_0638_0048_0002$$$::She wouldn't have anything to say to me.::
69346::$$$message_0638_0049_0000$$$::Of course not.[lr]::
69347::$$$message_0638_0049_0001$$$::Saber's only job is to eliminate intruders.[lr]::
69348::$$$message_0638_0049_0002$$$::She's the gatekeeper and executioner here.[lr]::
69349::$$$message_0638_0049_0003$$$::She's the strongest Servant protecting Sakura, and she could take us both alone.::
69350::$$$message_0638_0050_0000$$$::"...Hmph. Doesn't look like we'll be able to talk our way through."[lr]::
69351::$$$message_0638_0050_0001$$$::Tohsaka arms herself with the Jeweled Sword she kept behind her waist, keeping her stance low.::
69352::$$$message_0638_0051_0000$$$::   She intends to attack from the front.[lr]::
69353::$$$message_0638_0051_0001$$$::I don't know what powers that sword has, but she seems to think it'll work in a clash against Saber.::
69354::$$$message_0638_0052_0000$$$::But it won't go well.[lr]::
69355::$$$message_0638_0052_0001$$$::I know Saber, so there are ways to deal with her. We shouldn't reveal our only secret weapon while Zouken and Assassin could still be waiting[line2]::
69356::$$$message_0638_0053_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, wait! Saber is[line2]"[lr]::
69357::$$$message_0638_0053_0001$$$::"Rin. I have no reason to fight you. Take care not to point that sword at me. I would be violating Sakura's orders if I killed you here now."::
69358::$$$message_0638_0054_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
69359::$$$message_0638_0054_0001$$$::Saber's quiet voice is the same as ever. It stops Rin in her tracks.[lr]::
69360::$$$message_0638_0054_0002$$$::Tohsaka and I both know what that means.::
69361::$$$message_0638_0055_0000$$$::"...What do you mean? Aren't you the gatekeeper here, Saber?"[lr]::
69362::$$$message_0638_0055_0001$$$::"Yes. I will eliminate any who attempt to pass.[lr]::
69363::$$$message_0638_0055_0002$$$::That was Sakura's order. But..."[lr]::
69364::$$$message_0638_0055_0003$$$::"I'm an exception. She wants to see me?"[lr]::
69365::$$$message_0638_0055_0004$$$::Saber nods wordlessly.::
69366::$$$message_0638_0056_0000$$$::"...Okay. Sakura's serious, then."[lr]::
69367::$$$message_0638_0056_0001$$$::She murmurs briefly.[lr]::
69368::$$$message_0638_0056_0002$$$::After a big sigh, Tohsaka walks toward Saber.::
69369::$$$message_0638_0057_0000$$$::"Tohsaka."[lr]::
69370::$$$message_0638_0057_0001$$$::"Sorry. That's how it is, so I'm going on ahead."[lr]::
69371::$$$message_0638_0057_0002$$$::Tohsaka boldly walks past Saber.[lr]::
69372::$$$message_0638_0057_0003$$$::Just before she blends into the dark...[lr]::
69373::$$$message_0638_0057_0004$$$::"Shirou. I don't know what will happen to you, but I trust you. Make sure you live up to that."::
69374::$$$message_0638_0058_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
69375::$$$message_0638_0058_0001$$$::...Hold on.[lr]::
69376::$$$message_0638_0058_0002$$$::I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with that vague statement, not that my brain is working very well right now.[lr]::
69377::$$$message_0638_0058_0003$$$::"I-I'm saying that I don't want you to complain when you show up after everything's over! ...If you want to save Sakura, then don't take too long."[lr]::
69378::$$$message_0638_0058_0004$$$::Tohsaka's long hair whips through the air, and she disappears into the depths of the cave without looking back.::
69379::$$$message_0638_0059_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
69380::$$$message_0638_0059_0001$$$::...Thanks, Tohsaka.[lr]::
69381::$$$message_0638_0059_0002$$$::That boosted my spirits.[lr]::
69382::$$$message_0638_0059_0003$$$::In other words, telling me to come before she settles the score with Sakura was her roundabout way of cheering me on.[lr]::
69383::$$$message_0638_0059_0004$$$::"That is impossible. You will die here, Shirou."[lr]::
69384::$$$message_0638_0059_0005$$$::"...!"::
69385::$$$message_0638_0060_0000$$$::Saber's bloodlust swells.[lr]::
69386::$$$message_0638_0060_0001$$$::Tohsaka's gone, leaving only me.[lr]::
69387::$$$message_0638_0060_0002$$$::I suppose that in this situation, Saber doesn't need to hide her hostility anymore.::
69388::$$$message_0638_0061_0000$$$::"...I thought you said you'd only attack people who tried to get past you. I haven't moved a single step."[lr]::
69389::$$$message_0638_0061_0001$$$::"It is only a matter of time. You're not going to leave."::
69390::$$$message_0638_0062_0000$$$::Saber's right.[lr]::
69391::$$$message_0638_0062_0001$$$::There's no retreat. I'm going to keep going, even if I have to fight Saber.::
69392::$$$message_0638_0063_0000$$$::"Hmph. Yeah, you know me well.[lr]::
69393::$$$message_0638_0063_0001$$$::I never listened and always made trouble for you. You still remember how stupid I was."::
69394::$$$message_0638_0064_0000$$$::I move my dry tongue.[lr]::
69395::$$$message_0638_0064_0001$$$::I'm nearly scared witless.[lr]::
69396::$$$message_0638_0064_0002$$$::When we sparred in the dojo, Saber used less than a tenth of her strength against me, and I never managed to land a single blow.[lr]::
69397::$$$message_0638_0064_0003$$$::In other words, there's no way I can win.[lr]::
69398::$$$message_0638_0064_0004$$$::The instant we cross swords, my head will fly.::
69399::$$$message_0638_0065_0000$$$::So, I need to find any vulnerability I can.[lr]::
69400::$$$message_0638_0065_0001$$$::If there isn't one, I'll make one.[lr]::
69401::$$$message_0638_0065_0002$$$::I might be able to use small talk or sentiment to at least distract her a little bit.::
69402::$$$message_0638_0066_0000$$$::...This battle isn't a contest of sword skills at all.[lr]::
69403::$$$message_0638_0066_0001$$$::First, I need to do everything within my power to find a way to win.::
69404::$$$message_0638_0067_0000$$$::"You talk too much, Shirou. Do you want me to kill you sooner?"[lr]::
69405::$$$message_0638_0067_0001$$$::"Damn, Saber, that's scary. ...But you're keeping yourself in check pretty well. You say you'll kill me, so why haven't you?"::
69406::$$$message_0638_0068_0000$$$::"...Because I decided so. I will give you time to approach me.[lr]::
69407::$$$message_0638_0068_0001$$$::But it will end there. I will not let you go to Sakura. I don't need to move. You will run out of patience and attack me."::
69408::$$$message_0638_0069_0000$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
69409::$$$message_0638_0069_0001$$$::...Well, that was an utter failure.[lr]::
69410::$$$message_0638_0069_0002$$$::Saber doesn't have any weaknesses to exploit.[lr]::
69411::$$$message_0638_0069_0003$$$::She's waiting for me to approach, and she isn't going to move from her position.::
69412::$$$message_0638_0070_0000$$$::"...Crap. Do I have to challenge her head-on?"[lr]::
69413::$$$message_0638_0070_0001$$$::I force air out of my lungs.[lr]::
69414::$$$message_0638_0070_0002$$$::I only have one way left.[lr]::
69415::$$$message_0638_0070_0003$$$::Archer's arm.[lr]::
69416::$$$message_0638_0070_0004$$$::All I can do is use Projection to defeat Saber, like I did with Berserker.::
69417::$$$message_0638_0071_0000$$$::Of course...[lr]::
69418::$$$message_0638_0071_0001$$$::I've already concluded that this won't be enough to beat her.::
69419::$$$message_0638_0072_0000$$$::"...Haah."[lr]::
69420::$$$message_0638_0072_0001$$$::I[line2]my mind.[lr]::
69421::$$$message_0638_0072_0002$$$::I sever[line3]legs[line2], [line1]sensation, only my thoughts to protect myself[line4]this headwind!::

69423::$$$message_0638_0073_0001$$$::I create weapons.[lr]::
69424::$$$message_0638_0073_0002$$$::They're the master-crafted swords that burden my Projection the least.[lr]::
69425::$$$message_0638_0073_0003$$$::Forged to be a husband-wife pair, they symbolize Archer's life.::
69426::$$$message_0638_0074_0000$$$::Yin sword, Bakuya. Yang sword, Kanshou.[lr]::
69427::$$$message_0638_0074_0001$$$::They don't boast any outstanding abilities, but their sturdiness as swords is assured.[lr]::
69428::$$$message_0638_0074_0002$$$::With these, I can clash blades[noise monocro=1 type=ltDodge opacity=200] with Saber, and they won't shatter in one or two blows.[stopnoise]::
69429::$$$message_0638_0075_0000$$$::"Archer's swords. So you aren't going to copy my sword, Shirou."[lr]::
69430::$$$message_0638_0075_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
69431::$$$message_0638_0075_0002$$$::My severed thoughts manage to come together.[lr]::
69432::$$$message_0638_0075_0003$$$::...What did Saber just say?[lr]::
69433::$$$message_0638_0075_0004$$$::She said that I'm not going to copy her sword.::
69434::$$$message_0638_0076_0000$$$::...That's impossible for me.[lr]::
69435::$$$message_0638_0076_0001$$$::It would take too much time to Project a Noble Phantasm of that caliber, and more importantly, I can't master her sacred sword.[lr]::
69436::$$$message_0638_0076_0002$$$::If I were up against a stationary target, I might have a chance, but I'd be too hard-pressed fighting Saber to invoke the sword's True Name.::
69437::$$$message_0638_0077_0000$$$::"...No, that has nothing to do with me. I only care that you have armed yourself.[lr]::
69438::$$$message_0638_0077_0001$$$::Even if your weapons are feeble, I consider that a hostile act."::
69439::$$$message_0638_0078_0000$$$::Saber's body sways.[lr]::
69440::$$$message_0638_0078_0001$$$::Soundlessly, she grips the hilt of her black sacred sword.[lr]::
69441::$$$message_0638_0078_0002$$$::"Come. Your body won't even last minutes."[lr]::
69442::$$$message_0638_0078_0003$$$::On the verge of collapse, I'm invited to a duel.::
69443::$$$message_0638_0079_0000$$$::   I move in.[lr]::
69444::$$$message_0638_0079_0001$$$::Choosing my first move, predicting Saber's interception, countering and evading[line2]I push it all aside and charge at her.[lr]::
69445::$$$message_0638_0079_0002$$$::I bring down Bakuya.[lr]::
69446::$$$message_0638_0079_0003$$$::I close the nearly ten meter span in a single breath and focus my will on my left arm in an explosive strike.::
69447::$$$message_0638_0080_0000$$$::   My downward slash is parried.[lr]::
69448::$$$message_0638_0080_0001$$$::I pay it no mind, cleaving the target with Kanshou.[lr]::
69449::$$$message_0638_0080_0002$$$::That doesn't work, either.[lr]::
69450::$$$message_0638_0080_0003$$$::Saber's sword completely turns my dual blades and thrusts at my throat before I can even see it...!::
69451::$$$message_0638_0081_0000$$$::"Ngh...!?"[lr]::
69452::$$$message_0638_0081_0001$$$::What is she surprised at?[lr]::
69453::$$$message_0638_0081_0002$$$::   It doesn't matter.[lr]::
69454::$$$message_0638_0081_0003$$$::Does she find it miraculous that Shirou Emiya unleashed an attack he should not have been capable of, and blocked a counter-strike that he shouldn't have been able to block?[lr]::
69455::$$$message_0638_0081_0004$$$::   It doesn't matter.[lr]::
69456::$$$message_0638_0081_0005$$$::What are these violent sparks and impacts occurring every second?[lr]::
69457::$$$message_0638_0081_0006$$$::   It really doesn't matter.::
69458::$$$message_0638_0082_0000$$$::   It's the rampage of someone approaching death, and a peaceful repose.[lr]::
69459::$$$message_0638_0082_0001$$$::I twist my body with superhuman agility.[lr]::
69460::$$$message_0638_0082_0002$$$::My blades surge like lightning.[lr]::
69461::$$$message_0638_0082_0003$$$::My thoughts clearly see ten moves into the future, and I can predict my life or death five seconds ahead.::
69462::$$$message_0638_0083_0000$$$::"Haah..."[lr]::
69463::$$$message_0638_0083_0001$$$::I have her on the defense.[lr]::
69464::$$$message_0638_0083_0002$$$::I only allowed her to attack during the first exchange, and now Saber can only defend against my assault.[lr]::
69465::$$$message_0638_0083_0003$$$::I've already defended against thirty strikes sharp enough to kill me instantly.::
69466::$$$message_0638_0084_0000$$$::"Hah... Ahh, gurgh..."[lr]::
69467::$$$message_0638_0084_0001$$$::Time stops.[lr]::
69468::$$$message_0638_0084_0002$$$::My body can't keep up with my mind.[lr]::
69469::$$$message_0638_0084_0003$$$::My body can't follow the experience that's being brought out.[lr]::
69470::$$$message_0638_0084_0004$$$::   That's why I chose Kanshou and Bakuya.[lr]::
69471::$$$message_0638_0084_0005$$$::I Projected more than just weapons.[lr]::
69472::$$$message_0638_0084_0006$$$::I've copied Archer's skills with the dual swords from his arm.[lr]::
69473::$$$message_0638_0084_0007$$$::It isn't perfect, [stopnoise]but right now, my skills are close to that of Archer.::
69474::$$$message_0638_0085_0000$$$::"Hah, haah... Haah..."[lr]::
69475::$$$message_0638_0085_0001$$$::That's why I can hold on.[lr]::
69476::$$$message_0638_0085_0002$$$::Each blow, each withdrawal erodes my eyesight, [stopnoise]but I can take this much.::
69477::$$$message_0638_0086_0000$$$::My mind and body are shaved away, leaving my existence smaller and smaller.[lr]::
69478::$$$message_0638_0086_0001$$$::My body screams in response to each of Saber's attacks, and I'm approaching my death thirty moves from now.[lr]::
69479::$$$message_0638_0086_0002$$$::But I don't feel fear.[lr]::
69480::$$$message_0638_0086_0003$$$::All I feel is...::
69481::$$$message_0638_0087_0000$$$::"Hah, hah... Haah, haah, haha, hahaha...!"[lr]::
69482::$$$message_0638_0087_0001$$$::Joy that I can keep up with her.[lr]::
69483::$$$message_0638_0087_0002$$$::I can fight.[lr]::
69484::$$$message_0638_0087_0003$$$::I'm fighting.[lr]::
69485::$$$message_0638_0087_0004$$$::I don't care that it's with borrowed knowledge and skills.[lr]::
69486::$$$message_0638_0087_0005$$$::I'm having an actual dual against [font italic=true]Saber![font italic=false]::
69487::$$$message_0638_0088_0000$$$::   I might have a chance at winning.[lr]::
69488::$$$message_0638_0088_0001$$$::Saber won't use her sacred sword.[lr]::
69489::$$$message_0638_0088_0002$$$::Maybe it's because the ceiling will cave in if she uses her sword, or maybe it's some other reason, but for now, Saber's fighting me with her swordsmanship only.::
69490::$$$message_0638_0089_0000$$$::I can hold out against that.[lr]::
69491::$$$message_0638_0089_0001$$$::As long as she doesn't use her sacred sword, I'm sure I'll find an opening...!::
69492::$$$message_0638_0090_0000$$$::"Hah...hah, aaaaaarggh!!!"[lr]::
69493::$$$message_0638_0090_0001$$$::I increase my speed.[lr]::
69494::$$$message_0638_0090_0002$$$::I shift the gear to high and slam on the accelerator.[lr]::
69495::$$$message_0638_0090_0003$$$::The holy shroud around my wrist is irritating.[lr]::
69496::$$$message_0638_0090_0004$$$::I feel bitter that I can only Project one more time.::
69497::$$$message_0638_0091_0000$$$::   Draw it out.[lr]::
69498::$$$message_0638_0091_0001$$$::Go deeper and further, beyond your limits.[lr]::
69499::$$$message_0638_0091_0002$$$::If I draw more of it out, I can fight Saber even longer and stronger!::
69500::$$$message_0638_0092_0000$$$::"Kuh...!"[lr]::
69501::$$$message_0638_0092_0001$$$::"Nngh...!"[lr]::
69502::$$$message_0638_0092_0002$$$::I pull back.[lr]::
69503::$$$message_0638_0092_0003$$$::Saber's attack hurls me backward, and I have to plant my feet behind me to regain my footing.::
69504::$$$message_0638_0093_0000$$$::"Hah... Haah, haah, haah..."[lr]::
69505::$$$message_0638_0093_0001$$$::My shoulders heave up and down as I catch my breath.[lr]::
69506::$$$message_0638_0093_0002$$$::My muscles are on fire.[lr]::
69507::$$$message_0638_0093_0003$$$::The heat in my body seems to vent from all my pores.::
69508::$$$message_0638_0094_0000$$$::"Hah... Whew..."[lr]::
69509::$$$message_0638_0094_0001$$$::Gripping Kanshou and Bakuya, I watch Saber.[lr]::
69510::$$$message_0638_0094_0002$$$::We're now ten meters apart. [lr]::
69511::$$$message_0638_0094_0003$$$::Even Saber would need a couple steps to close the distance.[lr]::
69512::$$$message_0638_0094_0004$$$::I have a little time to collect myself from here.::
69513::$$$message_0638_0095_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
69514::$$$message_0638_0095_0001$$$::I finally steady my breath.[lr]::
69515::$$$message_0638_0095_0002$$$::I look down at my body once.[lr]::
69516::$$$message_0638_0095_0003$$$::   It doesn't matter.[lr]::
69517::$$$message_0638_0095_0004$$$::I don't care what wounds I take, as long as they don't kill me instantly.[lr]::
69518::$$$message_0638_0095_0005$$$::It would be a problem if my mobility dropped, but thankfully, I don't feel any pain.::
69519::$$$message_0638_0096_0000$$$::I should be able to take five more of Saber's attacks.[lr]::
69520::$$$message_0638_0096_0001$$$::I can't predict the fight beyond that.[lr]::
69521::$$$message_0638_0096_0002$$$::In the next five moves, I need to find an opening and exploit it with all my might.::
69522::$$$message_0638_0097_0000$$$::"Not possible. You won't be able to hurt me using that method, much less defeat me."[lr]::
69523::$$$message_0638_0097_0001$$$::And yet...[lr]::
69524::$$$message_0638_0097_0002$$$::Saber cuts through my thoughts with a sentence.::
69525::$$$message_0638_0098_0000$$$::"...Why not? I can fight you."[lr]::
69526::$$$message_0638_0098_0001$$$::"You would still howl that, with that body? ...No, you attempt such reckless ploys because of that very body. You may not bleed, and your innards may be made of swords, but your body is at its limit. If you continue this, my next strike will destroy you, swords and all."::

69531::$$$message_0638_0099_0004$$$::I only have one Projection left.[lr]::
69532::$$$message_0638_0099_0005$$$::I have to use the one last sword allowed to me to defeat Saber.::
69533::$$$message_0638_0100_0000$$$::"...I won't know until I try. I'm going to come at you even harder now. If I can surpass you in the next five moves[line2]"[lr]::

69536::$$$message_0638_0101_0000$$$::Her words contain a profound message.[lr]::
69537::$$$message_0638_0101_0001$$$::They show a concern for me that renders my warped, ruined thoughts crystal clear.::
69538::$$$message_0638_0102_0000$$$::   What am I holding my strength back for?::
69539::$$$message_0638_0103_0000$$$::...She's right.[lr]::
69540::$$$message_0638_0103_0001$$$::I'm going to die unless I defeat Saber.[lr]::
69541::$$$message_0638_0103_0002$$$::But I still haven't used my trump card.[lr]::
69542::$$$message_0638_0103_0003$$$::I was saving one last Projection to save Sakura.[lr]::
69543::$$$message_0638_0103_0004$$$::And yet...[lr]::
69544::$$$message_0638_0103_0005$$$::It won't mean anything if I can't even reach her.::

69556::$$$message_0638_0106_0001$$$::There's meaning to this fight.[lr]::
69557::$$$message_0638_0106_0002$$$::By not fleeing, I kept Saber tied up here.[lr]::

69559::$$$message_0638_0107_0000$$$::   But it's only temporary.[lr]::
69560::$$$message_0638_0107_0001$$$::Sakura could call Saber back at any moment.[lr]::
69561::$$$message_0638_0107_0002$$$::She'll probably do it if Tohsaka backs her into a corner.[lr]::
69562::$$$message_0638_0107_0003$$$::Once that happens, Tohsaka will fail.[lr]::
69563::$$$message_0638_0107_0004$$$::Which means that what I need to do now is make absolutely sure that Saber can't rejoin Sakura.::
69564::$$$message_0638_0108_0000$$$::"Saber, did you[line2]"[lr]::
69565::$$$message_0638_0108_0001$$$::"Is that all you take me for, Shirou?"::
69566::$$$message_0638_0109_0000$$$::   My heart stops.[lr]::
69567::$$$message_0638_0109_0001$$$::No, it's been stopped for several seconds.[lr]::
69568::$$$message_0638_0109_0002$$$::My body's already falling apart.[lr]::
69569::$$$message_0638_0109_0003$$$::My fate was sealed as soon as I removed the holy shroud in the Einzbern Forest.::
69570::$$$message_0638_0110_0000$$$::My senseless body and this mind that's no longer mine don't fear death.[lr]::
69571::$$$message_0638_0110_0001$$$::I don't even know what fear is anymore.[lr]::
69572::$$$message_0638_0110_0002$$$::I've survived this far in order to save Sakura.[lr]::

69575::$$$message_0638_0112_0000$$$::I've made up my mind.[lr]::
69576::$$$message_0638_0112_0001$$$::Unless I defeat Saber, Tohsaka will have to face Zouken, Sakura, and Saber.[lr]::
69577::$$$message_0638_0112_0002$$$::It's worth taking one of them out.[lr]::
69578::$$$message_0638_0112_0003$$$::I may not live to see it, but if this helps Tohsaka, then it'll save Sakura in the end.::

69582::$$$message_0638_0113_0003$$$::I still haven't fully grasped their potential.[lr]::
69583::$$$message_0638_0113_0004$$$::From Archer's arm, I draw out Kanshou and Bakuya's properties and his skills with them.::

69648::$$$message_0638_0132_0001$$$::With instincts bordering on foresight, the enemy evades Kanshou's attack from behind.[lr]::
69649::$$$message_0638_0132_0002$$$::I exploit the perfect opening and swing Bakuya[line2][lr]::
69650::$$$message_0638_0132_0003$$$::"Ngh, haah!"[lr]::
69651::$$$message_0638_0132_0004$$$::It shatters against the enemy's sword.::
69652::$$$message_0638_0133_0000$$$::   She's a monster.[lr]::
69653::$$$message_0638_0133_0001$$$::She just blocked ambushes from behind and a full-power frontal attack, all at the same time.[lr]::
69654::$$$message_0638_0133_0002$$$::On top of that, she completely destroyed the Bakuya I used to attack from the front.[lr]::

69656::$$$message_0638_0134_0000$$$::And yet...[lr]::

69660::$$$message_0638_0135_0001$$$::Again, Bakuya swoops in from behind.[lr]::
69661::$$$message_0638_0135_0002$$$::It goes without saying that this is part of the first pair I threw and she blocked.::
69662::$$$message_0638_0136_0000$$$::Kanshou and Bakuya are mated swords.[lr]::
69663::$$$message_0638_0136_0001$$$::Thanks to that trait, they are drawn to each other like magnets.[lr]::
69664::$$$message_0638_0136_0002$$$::In other words...as long as I'm holding Kanshou, Bakuya will automatically return to my hand!::
69665::$$$message_0638_0137_0000$$$::"Kugh...!"[lr]::
69666::$$$message_0638_0137_0001$$$::My enemy evades the surprise attack with godlike reflexes.[lr]::
69667::$$$message_0638_0137_0002$$$::I use Kanshou to strike her exposed chest...[lr]::
69668::$$$message_0638_0137_0003$$$::But the enemy breaks my final attack, too.::

69670::$$$message_0638_0138_0001$$$::Time freezes over.[lr]::
69671::$$$message_0638_0138_0002$$$::I take less than a second to confirm our positions.[lr]::
69672::$$$message_0638_0138_0003$$$::This is the limit of my offense.[lr]::
69673::$$$message_0638_0138_0004$$$::She just defended against two pairs of Kanshou and Bakuya[line2]four swords attacking from front and back at the same time. I don't have anything else after she destroyed all my weapons.::
69674::$$$message_0638_0139_0000$$$::The enemy's at her limit, too.[lr]::
69675::$$$message_0638_0139_0001$$$::She was forced to expose herself to destroy one of my attacks.[lr]::
69676::$$$message_0638_0139_0002$$$::I have nothing else.::
69677::$$$message_0638_0140_0000$$$::We're at a stalemate after that exchange of offense and defense.[lr]::
69678::$$$message_0638_0140_0001$$$::She recovers from her moment of complete defenselessness one second later.[lr]::
69679::$$$message_0638_0140_0002$$$::However...[lr]::
69680::$$$message_0638_0140_0003$$$::I still have more plans up my sleeve.::

69682::$$$message_0638_0141_0001$$$::The enemy's expression stiffens.[lr]::
69683::$$$message_0638_0141_0002$$$::The last ten percent of me is crumbling.[lr]::

69686::$$$message_0638_0141_0005$$$::With a third Projection, I overcome my limits and go beyond.[lr]::
69687::$$$message_0638_0141_0006$$$::A pair of swords appears in my empty hands once again.::

69694::$$$message_0638_0143_0003$$$::But it's too bad.[lr]::
69695::$$$message_0638_0143_0004$$$::I don't know if I should be proud that I remember, or regret it.::
69696::$$$message_0638_0144_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
69697::$$$message_0638_0144_0001$$$::In any case, I defeated the enemy.[lr]::
69698::$$$message_0638_0144_0002$$$::The last strike felt perfect.[lr]::
69699::$$$message_0638_0144_0003$$$::Now I can rest.[lr]::

69705::$$$message_0638_0146_0001$$$::Two swords come in from the left and right.[lr]::
69706::$$$message_0638_0146_0002$$$::She foresaw the attack, but she can't defend against it.[lr]::
69707::$$$message_0638_0146_0003$$$::Her body can't keep up with her mind.[lr]::
69708::$$$message_0638_0146_0004$$$::She was unable to freely move for one brief second after thwarting the enemy's second surprise attack.::
69709::$$$message_0638_0147_0000$$$::"Rgh, argh...!"[lr]::
69710::$$$message_0638_0147_0001$$$::She falls on her back.[lr]::
69711::$$$message_0638_0147_0002$$$::...She has taken a mortal blow.[lr]::
69712::$$$message_0638_0147_0003$$$::Kanshou and Bakuya pierced her armor and rent her torso. The shock of it all the way into her spine.::

69714::$$$message_0638_0148_0001$$$::She grunts in agony.[lr]::
69715::$$$message_0638_0148_0002$$$::What an explosive attack.[lr]::
69716::$$$message_0638_0148_0003$$$::She has suffered wounds that would have killed a normal man. She's only still alive because she's a Servant.::
69717::$$$message_0638_0149_0000$$$::"Rrgh... Ah, agh, hah..."[lr]::
69718::$$$message_0638_0149_0001$$$::Furthermore, she has an innate ability to heal herself.[lr]::
69719::$$$message_0638_0149_0002$$$::A powerful regeneration ability, and functionally infinite magical energy.[lr]::
69720::$$$message_0638_0149_0003$$$::The only way to defeat her in her current state is to destroy her heart or her head once and for all.[lr]::
69721::$$$message_0638_0149_0004$$$::Failing that, she will recover in less than ten minutes.[lr]::
69722::$$$message_0638_0149_0005$$$::Conversely, she is vulnerable to a coup de grace for the next ten minutes.::
69723::$$$message_0638_0150_0000$$$::"Hah... agh... You've become strong, Shirou."[lr]::
69724::$$$message_0638_0150_0001$$$::She speaks to the boy collapsed next to her.[lr]::
69725::$$$message_0638_0150_0002$$$::His wounds are deep and life-threatening, but he can still move well compared to her.[lr]::
69726::$$$message_0638_0150_0003$$$::It would be easy for him to stand up and drive a sword into her heart while she's helpless.::
69727::$$$message_0638_0151_0000$$$::"...No, that's not quite true. You were always strong."[lr]::
69728::$$$message_0638_0151_0001$$$::She murmurs with labored breaths.[lr]::
69729::$$$message_0638_0151_0002$$$::The duel is over.[lr]::
69730::$$$message_0638_0151_0003$$$::She accepts that she will disappear in a few more seconds, and calls out to him in a nostalgic tone.::
69731::$$$message_0638_0152_0000$$$::"Now, finish me. I will regenerate unless you hurry."[lr]::
69732::$$$message_0638_0152_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
69733::$$$message_0638_0152_0002$$$::He doesn't answer.[lr]::
69734::$$$message_0638_0152_0003$$$::"...Shirou?"[lr]::
69735::$$$message_0638_0152_0004$$$::She looks confused.[lr]::
69736::$$$message_0638_0152_0005$$$::She turns to look at the boy lying next to her.::
69737::$$$message_0638_0153_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
69738::$$$message_0638_0153_0001$$$::Nobody is there anymore.[lr]::
69739::$$$message_0638_0153_0002$$$::His heart is moving and he's breathing.[lr]::
69740::$$$message_0638_0153_0003$$$::His eyes are open, staring up at the ceiling.[lr]::
69741::$$$message_0638_0153_0004$$$::But that is all there is.[lr]::
69742::$$$message_0638_0153_0005$$$::The moment he cast the third Projection, the boy's mind shattered.[lr]::
69743::$$$message_0638_0153_0006$$$::...He reached his limits, and stepped beyond them.[lr]::
69744::$$$message_0638_0153_0007$$$::The consequence of that now lies next to her.::
69745::$$$message_0638_0154_0000$$$::"Then... I win, Shirou."[lr]::
69746::$$$message_0638_0154_0001$$$::Her whisper contains no emotion.[lr]::
69747::$$$message_0638_0154_0002$$$::She's used to it.[lr]::
