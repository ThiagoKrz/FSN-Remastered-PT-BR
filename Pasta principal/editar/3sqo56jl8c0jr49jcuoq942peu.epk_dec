54408::$$$message_0481_0000_0000$$$::"Ugh... I have a bad feeling about this, but I don't have a choice if that's your condition. I'll do what you want."[lr]::
54409::$$$message_0481_0000_0001$$$::I convince myself to say yes, even if it's heartbreaking.::
54410::$$$message_0481_0001_0000$$$::I give her my answer...[lr]::
54411::$$$message_0481_0001_0001$$$::Is it just me, or does Tohsaka look displeased?::
54412::$$$message_0481_0002_0000$$$::"What, Tohsaka? Was that the wrong answer?"[lr]::
54413::$$$message_0481_0002_0001$$$::"No. You gave the ideal answer, even if it's a little lacking. We'll go ahead with that, since you agree.[lr]::
54414::$$$message_0481_0002_0002$$$::I'm going to cast a spell on you, then. It'll make your words true."::
54415::$$$message_0481_0003_0000$$$::"Huh? Make my words true?"[lr]::
54416::$$$message_0481_0003_0001$$$::"A Geass[line2]a magical compulsion. It's one of the strongest curses there are, and not to be used lightly.[lr]::
54417::$$$message_0481_0003_0002$$$::With your consent, even I can secure this agreement."::
54418::$$$message_0481_0004_0000$$$::"A curse of compulsion...like a Servant's Command Spell?"[lr]::
54419::$$$message_0481_0004_0001$$$::"Yeah, but less versatile.[lr]::
54420::$$$message_0481_0004_0002$$$::It's more like restriction of movement, and I can't force you to give up your life. I'll make it last until the end of the Holy Grail War. You don't have a problem with that, do you?"::
54421::$$$message_0481_0005_0000$$$::"Uh...sure, that's fine."[lr]::
54422::$$$message_0481_0005_0001$$$::"Then close your eyes and don't move for a bit. Don't activate your Magic Circuits, either."::
54423::$$$message_0481_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
54424::$$$message_0481_0006_0001$$$::...I obey and close my eyes.[lr]::
54425::$$$message_0481_0006_0002$$$::"Satz. (Hear me.)[r]::
54426::$$$message_0481_0006_0003$$$::Beklagter, meine Wärter werden geglaubt. (You swear upon the scales to abide by our pact.)[r]::
54427::$$$message_0481_0006_0004$$$::Weiß ist schwarz. (The fault lies here.)[r]::
54428::$$$message_0481_0006_0005$$$::Richtige übliche Peitsche. (Let fire overcome water.)[r]::
54429::$$$message_0481_0006_0006$$$::Die Vergeltung von Himmel. (Conduct Shirou Emiya.)"::
54430::$$$message_0481_0007_0000$$$::   A fire lights up in my very core.[lr]::
54431::$$$message_0481_0007_0001$$$::Tohsaka's chant permeates not just my body but my heart, intertwining with my nerves.::
54432::$$$message_0481_0008_0000$$$::I hear a sound like a bottle shaking.[lr]::
54433::$$$message_0481_0008_0001$$$::Next to my heart,[lr]::
54434::$$$message_0481_0008_0002$$$::a smaller heart comes into being.::
54435::$$$message_0481_0009_0000$$$::   The bell rings to announce the end of lunch time.[lr]::
54436::$$$message_0481_0009_0001$$$::Lunch went by in a flash. Tohsaka's magecraft must have had me in a trance.::
54437::$$$message_0481_0010_0000$$$::"Okay, done. Our contract is active."::
54438::$$$message_0481_0011_0000$$$::"Let's meet up at the front gate after school, then.[lr]::
54439::$$$message_0481_0011_0001$$$::I'm going to have you do club activities at my house for the time being."[lr]::
54440::$$$message_0481_0011_0002$$$::"Um. Club activities? At your house?"::
54441::$$$message_0481_0012_0000$$$::"Yeah. Since we're teaming up, I should teach you to be able to fight on your own as much as I can, right?[lr]::
54442::$$$message_0481_0012_0001$$$::...I already know you're an amateur since the other night, though, so we'll need to have you come over multiple days."::
54443::$$$message_0481_0013_0000$$$::"I don't mind. I'd appreciate that, actually.[r]::
54444::$$$message_0481_0013_0001$$$::Um, are we starting today?"::
54445::$$$message_0481_0014_0000$$$::"Obviously. We need to gauge your abilities first, then figure out how to proceed from tonight.[lr]::
54446::$$$message_0481_0014_0001$$$::You'll be getting home pretty late, but that's fine since you live alone anyway, right?"[lr]::
54447::$$$message_0481_0014_0002$$$::"Huh? Oh, right."::
54448::$$$message_0481_0015_0000$$$::Tohsaka leaves with a casual wave.[lr]::
54449::$$$message_0481_0015_0001$$$::A chime announces the end of lunch.[lr]::
54450::$$$message_0481_0015_0002$$$::Today's Friday. Classes run until sixth period, and we get out after 3:00 PM.::
54451::$$$message_0481_0016_0000$$$::"...Oh, man. I told Sakura I'd come home early, but I can't just cancel on Tohsaka the very first day."[lr]::
54452::$$$message_0481_0016_0001$$$::I'm sorry to Sakura who I'm taking care of at home, but I'll need to join Tohsaka today.::
54453::$$$message_0481_0017_0000$$$::...Well, Tohsaka isn't a monster.[lr]::
54454::$$$message_0481_0017_0001$$$::If I explain Sakura's situation, then there's a chance she'll let me go home early just for today... Yeah. I'm pretty sure she will.::
