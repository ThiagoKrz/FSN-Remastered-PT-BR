46428::$$$message_0411_0000_0000$$$::                                                  And I recall his dream.::
46429::$$$message_0411_0001_0000$$$::The memory of the man who was set up as a hero.[lr]::
46430::$$$message_0411_0001_0001$$$::The story of a knight whose end came to a place that I can't reach.::
46431::$$$message_0411_0002_0000$$$::That hill is his world.[lr]::
46432::$$$message_0411_0002_0001$$$::The desolate wasteland that the man obtained by fighting for others.[lr]::
46433::$$$message_0411_0002_0002$$$::Apparently he died smiling in satisfaction, holding on to this view.::
46434::$$$message_0411_0003_0000$$$::"...He's seriously stupid."[lr]::
46435::$$$message_0411_0003_0001$$$::...Yes, that just makes me seriously mad.[lr]::
46436::$$$message_0411_0003_0002$$$::He tried his best, worked hard even though he was an ordinary person, and finally obtained a miracle with his own blood.[lr]::
46437::$$$message_0411_0003_0003$$$::Then it'll be a lie if he doesn't become happy.[lr]::
46438::$$$message_0411_0003_0004$$$::If he made many people happy, then he had to become happier than all those people combined.::
46439::$$$message_0411_0004_0000$$$::But, he did not receive such a reward.[lr]::
46440::$$$message_0411_0004_0001$$$::The only thing he was given was the fate to be used as a Guardian after his death.::
46441::$$$message_0411_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46442::$$$message_0411_0005_0001$$$::That's right. Why didn't I realize that?[lr]::
46443::$$$message_0411_0005_0002$$$::Guardians are summoned into every age.[lr]::
46444::$$$message_0411_0005_0003$$$::Doesn't that mean that they are summoned from every age?[lr]::
46445::$$$message_0411_0005_0004$$$::In other words, from the present and the past.[lr]::
46446::$$$message_0411_0005_0005$$$::And Heroic Spirits can even be summoned from the future we have not yet seen.::
46447::$$$message_0411_0006_0000$$$::For Guardians who are pushed into a position off of the axis of time, the concept of time does not exist.[lr]::
46448::$$$message_0411_0006_0001$$$::At the point that they became a Heroic Spirit, they sublimate into something other than what they used to be when they were human.[lr]::
46449::$$$message_0411_0006_0002$$$::Then...[lr]::
46450::$$$message_0411_0006_0003$$$::It is possible for a Guardian to be summoned into the place and age they lived in when they were alive.::
46451::$$$message_0411_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46452::$$$message_0411_0007_0001$$$::It's vexing when I think about it.[lr]::
46453::$$$message_0411_0007_0002$$$::It's because neither of them gets salvation.[lr]::
46454::$$$message_0411_0007_0003$$$::The one that watches his past self...[lr]::
46455::$$$message_0411_0007_0004$$$::or the one that watches his eventual self...[lr]::
46456::$$$message_0411_0007_0005$$$::They will only hurt by how they changed.::
46457::$$$message_0411_0008_0000$$$::I already know the end of this big idiot who tried to be of help to others.[lr]::
46458::$$$message_0411_0008_0001$$$::He became a Guardian by choice.[lr]::
46459::$$$message_0411_0008_0002$$$::He thought that it was more than he could ask for if he could save people even after he died.[lr]::
46460::$$$message_0411_0008_0003$$$::He did not have the power to save people when he was alive, but he believed that he could break through any tragedy as a Heroic Spirit.::
46461::$$$message_0411_0009_0000$$$::Thinking so, he made a contract with the world to give his body after death, and saved hundreds of lives.[lr]::
46462::$$$message_0411_0009_0001$$$::He believed he would be able to save tens of thousands of people and more after that.::
46463::$$$message_0411_0010_0000$$$::    But, he was betrayed by such hope.[lr]::
46464::$$$message_0411_0010_0001$$$::Places where Heroic Spirits and Guardians appear are only hell.[lr]::
46465::$$$message_0411_0010_0002$$$::They only appear when the world is about to be destroyed by people.[lr]::
46466::$$$message_0411_0010_0003$$$::Humans are beings that perish by their own doings.[lr]::
46467::$$$message_0411_0010_0004$$$::That's why the process of destruction should always be the same.::
46468::$$$message_0411_0011_0000$$$::He was only summoned to those "hells."[lr]::
46469::$$$message_0411_0011_0001$$$::In the land where the ones he wanted to save were already dead, he killed even more people.[lr]::
46470::$$$message_0411_0011_0002$$$::The boy who said he just didn't want to see anyone cry...[lr]::
46471::$$$message_0411_0011_0003$$$::...Could only see humans crying forever.::
46472::$$$message_0411_0012_0000$$$::There is only one thing I can say.[lr]::
46473::$$$message_0411_0012_0001$$$::He has been betrayed by many things the whole time.[lr]::
46474::$$$message_0411_0012_0002$$$::And in the very end, he was even betrayed by the only thing he believed in, his ideal.::
46475::$$$message_0411_0013_0000$$$::                               I am the bone of my sword.[lr]::
46476::$$$message_0411_0013_0001$$$::                               Steel is my body, and fire is my blood. [lr]::
46477::$$$message_0411_0013_0002$$$::                               I have created over a thousand blades. [lr]::
46478::$$$message_0411_0013_0003$$$::                               Unknown to Death,[lr]::
46479::$$$message_0411_0013_0004$$$::                               nor known to Life. [lr]::
46480::$$$message_0411_0013_0005$$$::                               Have withstood pain to create many weapons. [lr]::
46481::$$$message_0411_0013_0006$$$::                               Yet, those hands will never hold anything. [lr]::
46482::$$$message_0411_0013_0007$$$::                               So as I pray, UNLIMITED BLADE WORKS. ::
46483::$$$message_0411_0014_0000$$$::...That was the only spell he was given.[lr]::
46484::$$$message_0411_0014_0001$$$::What is that?[lr]::
46485::$$$message_0411_0014_0002$$$::It makes me so mad that I want to beat his chest and scold him.::
46486::$$$message_0411_0015_0000$$$::...I, Rin Tohsaka, have never had any hardships in my life.[lr]::
46487::$$$message_0411_0015_0001$$$::So I might not have the right to say it, but I believe in working hard and going through pain. It's wrong not to be rewarded for your battles.[lr]::
46488::$$$message_0411_0015_0002$$$::That's why I'm angry at his unrewarded life, and most of all... I can't leave him, who ended up cursing his life, be.::
46489::$$$message_0411_0016_0000$$$::"As long as you're my Servant, I won't do anything other than what I believe in.[lr]::
46490::$$$message_0411_0016_0001$$$::I'm not as naïve as Shirou Emiya, but there are still things that I cannot give up.[lr]::
46491::$$$message_0411_0016_0002$$$::No matter who it is, I don't have the intention of giving it up..."::
46492::$$$message_0411_0017_0000$$$::...That's right.[lr]::
46493::$$$message_0411_0017_0001$$$::That's why I swore that...[lr]::
46494::$$$message_0411_0017_0002$$$::As long as I'm his Master, I will believe in my path like he used to do.::
46495::$$$message_0411_0018_0000$$$::That's about all I can show to him.[lr]::
46496::$$$message_0411_0018_0001$$$::That's about the only way I can repay him.[lr]::
46497::$$$message_0411_0018_0002$$$::That might've been meaningless, but at least...[lr]::
46498::$$$message_0411_0018_0003$$$::I do it so that Archer, who lost sight of his own past, could realize that his life was something he can be proud of...::
46499::$$$message_0411_0019_0000$$$::"Ah... Mm..."[lr]::
46500::$$$message_0411_0019_0001$$$::The first thing I notice when I wake up from my slumber are the sensations in my limbs.[lr]::
46501::$$$message_0411_0019_0002$$$::They hurt, and I can't move them.[lr]::
46502::$$$message_0411_0019_0003$$$::"...I'm tied up."[lr]::
46503::$$$message_0411_0019_0004$$$::Plus, I'm sitting in a chair and seemed to be sleeping in an unnatural position.::
46504::$$$message_0411_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46505::$$$message_0411_0020_0001$$$::...I don't want to admit it, but I'm in the worst possible situation.[lr]::
46506::$$$message_0411_0020_0002$$$::To be honest, I can't do anything.[lr]::
46507::$$$message_0411_0020_0003$$$::My hands are behind the chair and restrained by something like handcuffs.[lr]::
46508::$$$message_0411_0020_0004$$$::My ankles are the same, and I can't stand from my chair.[lr]::
46509::$$$message_0411_0020_0005$$$::On top of that, my handcuffs and shackles are magecraft-resistant, and my Magic Circuit is so messed up that I can't even create magical energy.::
46510::$$$message_0411_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46511::$$$message_0411_0021_0001$$$::Now that I've confirmed my situation, I check my surroundings.[lr]::
46512::$$$message_0411_0021_0002$$$::...It's cold.[lr]::
46513::$$$message_0411_0021_0003$$$::The room made of stone has no heater, and it is an abandoned place that hasn't been used for a while.[lr]::
46514::$$$message_0411_0021_0004$$$::It's dark outside the windows. From the looks of it, it's probably past 10 PM or so.::
46515::$$$message_0411_0022_0000$$$::"So. What are you planning, Archer?"[lr]::
46516::$$$message_0411_0022_0001$$$::I glare into the darkness.[lr]::
46517::$$$message_0411_0022_0002$$$::...The shadow of the pillar.[lr]::
46518::$$$message_0411_0022_0003$$$::The knight in red is sitting on a pile of rubble.::
46519::$$$message_0411_0023_0000$$$::"Nothing. You are just bait to lure Shirou Emiya. You should know that."[lr]::
46520::$$$message_0411_0023_0001$$$::"...Heh. Shirou would come even if I wasn't here. You should know that."::
46521::$$$message_0411_0024_0000$$$::"...Yeah. But, it would be inconvenient if you were with him. I'll have you stay here quietly until things are settled."[lr]::
46522::$$$message_0411_0024_0001$$$::Archer states without appearing in front of me.[lr]::
46523::$$$message_0411_0024_0002$$$::There is no sign of previous intimacy.[lr]::
46524::$$$message_0411_0024_0003$$$::He is really a calm assassin now.::
46525::$$$message_0411_0025_0000$$$::"I see. So you will kill Shirou no matter what?"[lr]::
46526::$$$message_0411_0025_0001$$$::"Yeah. A naïve man like that should be killed right now."[lr]::
46527::$$$message_0411_0025_0002$$$::He replies, as if it's only natural.[lr]::
46528::$$$message_0411_0025_0003$$$::The only thing I can see from here is his shadowed side profile.[lr]::
46529::$$$message_0411_0025_0004$$$::His expression is cold, as if he's wearing a mask.[lr]::
46530::$$$message_0411_0025_0005$$$::That...makes me seriously infuriated.::
46531::$$$message_0411_0026_0000$$$::"...Heh. I don't even need to be told that Shirou is naïve."[lr]::
46532::$$$message_0411_0026_0001$$$::I take a breath.[lr]::
46533::$$$message_0411_0026_0002$$$::It'll end if I say this.[lr]::
46534::$$$message_0411_0026_0003$$$::Archer will never come back to me if I say that.[lr]::
46535::$$$message_0411_0026_0004$$$::I take a breath and stare at the man in the shadows.::
46536::$$$message_0411_0027_0000$$$::"But still, I think that naïve part of him is lovable.[lr]::
46537::$$$message_0411_0027_0001$$$::He needs to be like that. I'm saved by having a guy like him."::
46538::$$$message_0411_0028_0000$$$::"But what about you?[lr]::
46539::$$$message_0411_0028_0001$$$::You did this much, but you think it's wrong to preach a selfish ideal?[lr]::
46540::$$$message_0411_0028_0002$$$::You fought for others again and again, got betrayed again and again, and you were forced to clean up after them again and again...![lr]::
46541::$$$message_0411_0028_0003$$$::Did you get fed up with humans from that, Archer...!?"::
46542::$$$message_0411_0029_0000$$$::I get even more angry as I speak, and I'm yelling at the top of my lungs.[lr]::
46543::$$$message_0411_0029_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46544::$$$message_0411_0029_0002$$$::...Archer doesn't answer.[lr]::
46545::$$$message_0411_0029_0003$$$::His side profile consumed in the shadows is no longer the side profile that I know.::
