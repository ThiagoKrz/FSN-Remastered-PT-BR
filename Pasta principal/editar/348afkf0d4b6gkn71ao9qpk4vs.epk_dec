3200::$$$message_0034_0000_0000$$$::I stop prepping for dinner, and take off my apron.[lr]::
3201::$$$message_0034_0000_0001$$$::By the time I've washed my hands and made it to the living room, Fuji-nee's apple is gone.::
3202::$$$message_0034_0001_0000$$$::"Fuji-nee, did you eat the apple?"[lr]::
3203::$$$message_0034_0001_0001$$$::"Yep. It was nice and sweet. Tart too."[lr]::
3204::$$$message_0034_0001_0002$$$::"Glad to hear that. Then it's your turn. I'll take whatever you got me in exchange for what you just ate."::
3205::$$$message_0034_0002_0000$$$::"Huh? What I got you? Like the tangerine?"[lr]::
3206::$$$message_0034_0002_0001$$$::"...I'm not going to ask how you arrived at that conclusion.[lr]::
3207::$$$message_0034_0002_0002$$$::I'm just asking you to show me what you got for me today. I hope you didn't forget what you said this morning as you were leaving."::
3208::$$$message_0034_0003_0000$$$::"How rude. Of course I didn't forget. See? I have it right here."[lr]::
3209::$$$message_0034_0003_0001$$$::Fuji-nee drops a suspicious-looking paper bag on the table, and its contents spill out.::
3210::$$$message_0034_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
3211::$$$message_0034_0004_0001$$$::Well, that's...unexpected.[lr]::
3212::$$$message_0034_0004_0002$$$::I actually have trouble believing Fuji-nee managed to remember a promise she made.[lr]::
3213::$$$message_0034_0004_0003$$$::"...What even is that? I feel like this isn't anything I would[line2]"[lr]::
3214::$$$message_0034_0004_0004$$$::No matter how I look at it, it just looks like a mound of trash... Well, a mountain of stuffed toys.::
3215::$$$message_0034_0005_0000$$$::"This Aztec stone mask's for you, Shirou. Your room's pretty sparse, so I thought it might liven things up a bit."[lr]::
3216::$$$message_0034_0005_0001$$$::She hands me a heartwarming, but somewhat scary-looking sun mask.[lr]::
3217::$$$message_0034_0005_0002$$$::It's about the size of a handball, and stuffed with cotton.::
3218::$$$message_0034_0006_0000$$$::"Fuji-nee...were these all from a crane game?"[lr]::
3219::$$$message_0034_0006_0001$$$::"Yep. I worked really hard trying to get them. I spent two hours, and in the end, a worker took them out for me."[lr]::
3220::$$$message_0034_0006_0002$$$::She's laughing bashfully, but I'm scared to think how much blood was shed in the process.::
3221::$$$message_0034_0007_0000$$$::"Hm, so there's also a Chinese dragon, a bat, a crab, a cow, a rhinoceros, a snake, and a soldier..."[lr]::
3222::$$$message_0034_0007_0001$$$::Fuji-nee gleefully sorts out the pile of stuffed toys.::
3223::$$$message_0034_0008_0000$$$::A few spill off the table, and the living room quickly grows cluttered with them.[lr]::
3224::$$$message_0034_0008_0001$$$::It's messy, but Fuji-nee seems to be enjoying herself, so I don't have the heart to stop her.::
3225::$$$message_0034_0009_0000$$$::"Fine, I'll take them. I want you to clean up after you organize them."[lr]::
3226::$$$message_0034_0009_0001$$$::"Yup I know!"::
3227::$$$message_0034_0010_0000$$$::I turn back to the kitchen, the stuffed toy in hand.[lr]::
3228::$$$message_0034_0010_0001$$$::And then...[lr]::
3229::$$$message_0034_0010_0002$$$::I see Saber at the entrance of the living room. She must have just passed by. She looks irritated.::
3230::$$$message_0034_0011_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
3231::$$$message_0034_0011_0001$$$::Saber doesn't say a thing. She just glares into the living room.::
3232::$$$message_0034_0012_0000$$$::"Saber? Did you take your bath already?"[lr]::
3233::$$$message_0034_0012_0001$$$::"Yes. It was very nice."[lr]::
3234::$$$message_0034_0012_0002$$$::After answering my question, Saber heads into the living room, almost like a sleepwalker.::
3235::$$$message_0034_0013_0000$$$::Saber walks towards the table, then stops abruptly in front of one of the stuffed toys.[lr]::
3236::$$$message_0034_0013_0001$$$::"Taiga. Is this doll supposed to be a lion?"[lr]::
3237::$$$message_0034_0013_0002$$$::"Eh? Uh, yeah looks like it. That's supposed to be a baby lion."::
3238::$$$message_0034_0014_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
3239::$$$message_0034_0014_0001$$$::Saber stares silently at the stuffed animal.::
3240::$$$message_0034_0015_0000$$$::"Is this doll yours, Taiga?[lr]::
3241::$$$message_0034_0015_0001$$$::Um, like those other dolls."[lr]::
3242::$$$message_0034_0015_0002$$$::"They are. Do you want one, Saber? You can have one, if you like."[lr]::
3243::$$$message_0034_0015_0003$$$::Fuji-nee's offer is made with a lighthearted smile.::
3244::$$$message_0034_0016_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
3245::$$$message_0034_0016_0001$$$::Whoa, what the heck's Fuji-nee thinking?[lr]::
3246::$$$message_0034_0016_0002$$$::Saber's obviously in a bad mood, so why is Fuji-nee asking something so ridiculous!?[lr]::
3247::$$$message_0034_0016_0003$$$::Besides, there's no way Saber would want something like th[line2]::
3248::$$$message_0034_0017_0000$$$::"Do you want it? I don't really have any use for it, so you're welcome to it, Saber."[lr]::
3249::$$$message_0034_0017_0001$$$::Fuji-nee picks up the stuffed lion, not noticing Saber's distaste.::
3250::$$$message_0034_0018_0000$$$::Saber takes it and...[lr]::
3251::$$$message_0034_0018_0001$$$::"If I may."[lr]::
3252::$$$message_0034_0018_0002$$$::She hurries forward and takes it eagerly.::
3253::$$$message_0034_0019_0000$$$::"...Eh?"[lr]::
3254::$$$message_0034_0019_0001$$$::My mind locks up.[lr]::
3255::$$$message_0034_0019_0002$$$::What the hell am I seeing?[lr]::
3256::$$$message_0034_0019_0003$$$::Saber takes the completely useless doll and clutches it against her chest as if it were truly precious.::
3257::$$$message_0034_0020_0000$$$::"I appreciate it. Thank you, Taiga."[lr]::
3258::$$$message_0034_0020_0001$$$::"It's fine. It's not a tiger."[lr]::
3259::$$$message_0034_0020_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Uh...that's a bit of a weird thing to throw out there, Fuji-nee...[font italic=false]::
3260::$$$message_0034_0021_0000$$$::"But this is a surprise. I didn't know you liked that kind of thing, Saber."[lr]::
3261::$$$message_0034_0021_0001$$$::"Yes. I have always longed for small, cute things.[lr]::
3262::$$$message_0034_0021_0002$$$::I had precious few opportunities to hold such things."::
3263::$$$message_0034_0022_0000$$$::As she speaks, Saber looks down at the stuffed lion in her arms.[lr]::
3264::$$$message_0034_0022_0001$$$::How could I describe her face right now...[lr]::
3265::$$$message_0034_0022_0002$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
3266::$$$message_0034_0022_0003$$$::What was that?[lr]::
3267::$$$message_0034_0022_0004$$$::I just had the weirdest thought.::
3268::$$$message_0034_0023_0000$$$::"Hm? Do you like lions, Saber? Are we rivals?"[lr]::
3269::$$$message_0034_0023_0001$$$::Saber silently nods in affirmation, all while she continues to smile down at the stuffed animal.::
3270::$$$message_0034_0024_0000$$$::"It is not that I like lions, but I do have a connection with them.[lr]::
3271::$$$message_0034_0024_0001$$$::I once took care of a lion cub, and I remember being so happy that it bonded with me.[lr]::
3272::$$$message_0034_0024_0002$$$::Since then, I have had a special place for lions in my heart.[lr]::
3273::$$$message_0034_0024_0003$$$::By nature, I am associated with dragons..."::
3274::$$$message_0034_0025_0000$$$::"A lion cub, huh? Aren't lion cubs like cats? Doesn't that mean they bite, scratch, and jump?"::
3275::$$$message_0034_0026_0000$$$::"Yes. It was certainly energetic.[lr]::
3276::$$$message_0034_0026_0001$$$::I only took care of it for one month, but I would have liked to care for it till the end."::
3277::$$$message_0034_0027_0000$$$::"I see, I see. But it's tough. Lions get really big, so you can't take care of one in an ordinary house, so you had no choice but to let it go."[lr]::
3278::$$$message_0034_0027_0001$$$::Fuji-nee nods her understanding.::
3279::$$$message_0034_0028_0000$$$::Saber is still looking at the stuffed lion.[lr]::
3280::$$$message_0034_0028_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
3281::$$$message_0034_0028_0002$$$::I'm not sure what kind of spell it cast on her.[lr]::
3282::$$$message_0034_0028_0003$$$::But something I shouldn't know or be able to see flashes through my mind.::
3283::$$$message_0034_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
3284::$$$message_0034_0029_0001$$$::It has to just be some kind of dizzy spell...[lr]::
3285::$$$message_0034_0029_0002$$$::...but I can't shake the image.::
3286::$$$message_0034_0030_0000$$$::It's one of [font italic=true]her[font italic=false] memories.[lr]::
3287::$$$message_0034_0030_0001$$$::This is...something that really happened.[lr]::
3288::$$$message_0034_0030_0002$$$::I see an image of Saber rubbing her cheek against a cub.[lr]::
3289::$$$message_0034_0030_0003$$$::But I'm not sure if this is just some fleeting vision.[lr]::
3290::$$$message_0034_0030_0004$$$::The only thing I know is that I would regret shaking off the sight of it.::
3291::$$$message_0034_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
3292::$$$message_0034_0031_0001$$$::The strange vision immediately disappears.[lr]::
3293::$$$message_0034_0031_0002$$$::My heart is still racing.[lr]::
3294::$$$message_0034_0031_0003$$$::The vision I glimpsed remains in my head like a scar that will never fade.::
