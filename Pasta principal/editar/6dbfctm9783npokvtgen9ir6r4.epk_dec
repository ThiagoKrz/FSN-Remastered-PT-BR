37243::$$$message_0315_0000_0000$$$::       I'm dreaming.::
37244::$$$message_0315_0001_0000$$$::Like blood flowing through a thin circuit, I see a memory that I can't reach.::
37245::$$$message_0315_0002_0000$$$::For what did he fight and keep running?[lr]::
37246::$$$message_0315_0002_0001$$$::He never told anyone his innermost feelings.[lr]::
37247::$$$message_0315_0002_0002$$$::Everyone around him saw him as an eccentric.[lr]::
37248::$$$message_0315_0002_0003$$$::And on top of it all, he wore a mask of stoicism and few words, so others must've believed him ruthless.[lr]::
37249::$$$message_0315_0002_0004$$$::His objectives were unknown.[lr]::
37250::$$$message_0315_0002_0005$$$::Or at the very least, nobody was informed or found out.[lr]::
37251::$$$message_0315_0002_0006$$$::Even after becoming a hero, burdened with so many things, he never once let his intentions slip.::
37252::$$$message_0315_0003_0000$$$::And so nobody was able to grasp his character even at the end.[lr]::
37253::$$$message_0315_0003_0001$$$::Nobody understood.[lr]::
37254::$$$message_0315_0003_0002$$$::Though he was a convenient hero that saved lives, his motives and ends were left in the dark.::
37255::$$$message_0315_0004_0000$$$::Thus, it inevitably came to be that all would feel uneasy by his presence.[lr]::
37256::$$$message_0315_0004_0001$$$::So he should have claimed at least one such reason.[lr]::
37257::$$$message_0315_0004_0002$$$::Greed, fame, selfishness, revenge, devotion.[lr]::
37258::$$$message_0315_0004_0003$$$::A clear reason that would have been so universally understood. Had he but one such thing, this end would not have come.::
37259::$$$message_0315_0005_0000$$$::His reward for success was always betrayal.[lr]::
37260::$$$message_0315_0005_0001$$$::The things he picked up sifted through his fingers like sand.[lr]::
37261::$$$message_0315_0005_0002$$$::He got used to it.[lr]::
37262::$$$message_0315_0005_0003$$$::Like a fool, he got used to it.[lr]::
37263::$$$message_0315_0005_0004$$$::From the beginning, his reward...[lr]::
37264::$$$message_0315_0005_0005$$$::It was not what he received from those he saved, but the act of saving them itself.::
37265::$$$message_0315_0006_0000$$$::   The repetition of it makes me so mad that I want to punch him. But it also makes me want to cry.[lr]::
37266::$$$message_0315_0006_0001$$$::The reason he was called a hero...[lr]::
37267::$$$message_0315_0006_0002$$$::His intentions were never revealed to anyone.[lr]::
37268::$$$message_0315_0006_0003$$$::Those around him never came to know. And even he, the only one who could know, eventually forgot.::
37269::$$$message_0315_0007_0000$$$::    This all inherently makes me just want to cry.[lr]::
37270::$$$message_0315_0007_0001$$$::On the long, long path from the start to the finish...[lr]::
37271::$$$message_0315_0007_0002$$$::...He miraculously never once strayed from his original purpose, despite no longer knowing what was and was no longer right.::
37272::$$$message_0315_0008_0000$$$::And the end comes.[lr]::
37273::$$$message_0315_0008_0001$$$::A savior is nothing but a nuisance to those who are not saved.[lr]::
37274::$$$message_0315_0008_0002$$$::He understands his own powers and the extent of the world.[lr]::
37275::$$$message_0315_0008_0003$$$::He accepts there are those that he can and cannot save.[lr]::
37276::$$$message_0315_0008_0004$$$::And so he wanted those within sight to be happy, at least.[lr]::
37277::$$$message_0315_0008_0005$$$::Many others despised him, becrying his hypocrisy and narrow values.[lr]::
37278::$$$message_0315_0008_0006$$$::He had more enemies than allies, and he died abruptly at their hands.::
37279::$$$message_0315_0009_0000$$$::...So, what is seen here is not a location in this world.::
37280::$$$message_0315_0010_0000$$$::This place is his end.[lr]::
37281::$$$message_0315_0010_0001$$$::It is nothing other than the illusion he saw on the verge of death and the only pride he had within himself.[lr]::
37282::$$$message_0315_0010_0002$$$::The hero that used this view as his weapon is consumed by his own darkness in his final moment.::
37283::$$$message_0315_0011_0000$$$::He arrives at the hill of swords.[lr]::
37284::$$$message_0315_0011_0001$$$::The end of his battle came on a mound with rusted, ownerless blades.[lr]::
37285::$$$message_0315_0011_0002$$$::   Alone after all.[lr]::
37286::$$$message_0315_0011_0003$$$::Even then, there was nothing to regret if he was able to save everyone within view.[lr]::
37287::$$$message_0315_0011_0004$$$::He smiles with satisfaction and lets go of the sword.::
37288::$$$message_0315_0012_0000$$$::...That's why he never had any regrets.[lr]::
37289::$$$message_0315_0012_0001$$$::His objective had long been fulfilled.[lr]::
37290::$$$message_0315_0012_0002$$$::From the start, he kept on running with utmost effort, not for himself, but for those who had nothing to do with him...::
