59054::$$$message_0531_0000_0000$$$::Once school ends, I quickly start to head home.[lr]::
59055::$$$message_0531_0000_0001$$$::Since all after-school club activities are suspended, students crowd around the campus gate.::
59056::$$$message_0531_0001_0000$$$::I take a cursory look around, and don't see anyone who might be Tohsaka.[lr]::
59057::$$$message_0531_0001_0001$$$::Knowing her, she must have gone straight to the Matou house.::
59058::$$$message_0531_0002_0000$$$::"Sakura's...not around, huh."[lr]::
59059::$$$message_0531_0002_0001$$$::Without club practice in the afternoon, Sakura can just go home to my house.[lr]::
59060::$$$message_0531_0002_0002$$$::We didn't talk about meeting up to walk home together, so she must have gone on ahead.::
59061::$$$message_0531_0003_0000$$$::I take the lonely road up the hill.[lr]::
59062::$$$message_0531_0003_0001$$$::It's already been six days since the Holy Grail War started.[lr]::
59063::$$$message_0531_0003_0002$$$::Little by little, it feels like life is draining out of the town.::
59064::$$$message_0531_0004_0000$$$::"Argh..."[lr]::
59065::$$$message_0531_0004_0001$$$::Just as I reach the top of the hill, I'm struck by a bout of dizziness.[lr]::
59066::$$$message_0531_0004_0002$$$::It's like a hollow chill in my head, maybe it's some kind of anemia.[lr]::
59067::$$$message_0531_0004_0003$$$::I hear something resonating in my ear.::
59068::$$$message_0531_0005_0000$$$::"What's that noise?"[lr]::
59069::$$$message_0531_0005_0001$$$::I cover my ears, but my eardrums still ring.[lr]::
59070::$$$message_0531_0005_0002$$$::This isn't a hallucination.[lr]::
59071::$$$message_0531_0005_0003$$$::People don't just get hit by unexplained vertigo and tinnitus.[lr]::
59072::$$$message_0531_0005_0004$$$::And if they're happening at the same time, then it can only be deliberate.::
59073::$$$message_0531_0006_0000$$$::"Don't tell me something happened at home...!?"[lr]::
59074::$$$message_0531_0006_0001$$$::I shake off the dizziness and start running.[lr]::
59075::$$$message_0531_0006_0002$$$::Saber's at home.[lr]::
59076::$$$message_0531_0006_0003$$$::Even if an enemy attacked, it wouldn't go so easily for them as long as Saber's there...!::
59077::$$$message_0531_0007_0000$$$::The only pair of shoes at the front door belongs to Saber.[lr]::
59078::$$$message_0531_0007_0001$$$::"Thank god Sakura's not back yet!"[lr]::
59079::$$$message_0531_0007_0002$$$::I don't need to worry about holding back, then.[lr]::
59080::$$$message_0531_0007_0003$$$::If this strange situation is happening because of an enemy attack, then we can get through it somehow if only Saber and I are here...!::
59081::$$$message_0531_0008_0000$$$::"Saber, are you all right?"[lr]::
59082::$$$message_0531_0008_0001$$$::I rush to the living room.[lr]::
59083::$$$message_0531_0008_0002$$$::The instant I arrive,::
59084::$$$message_0531_0009_0000$$$::I can't stand anymore, and I tumble to the ground.::
59085::$$$message_0531_0010_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
59086::$$$message_0531_0010_0001$$$::My legs won't do what I want.[lr]::
59087::$$$message_0531_0010_0002$$$::The ringing in my ears robs me of my sense of balance.[lr]::
59088::$$$message_0531_0010_0003$$$::I'm crushed by an oppressive nausea and chill.[lr]::
59089::$$$message_0531_0010_0004$$$::I desperately try to prop myself up on my arms,[lr]::
59090::$$$message_0531_0010_0005$$$::when I notice that the color is fading from the marks on my left hand.::
59091::$$$message_0531_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59092::$$$message_0531_0011_0001$$$::My mind freezes.[lr]::
59093::$$$message_0531_0011_0002$$$::The Command Spells are pale.[lr]::
59094::$$$message_0531_0011_0003$$$::Before I process what that means,::
59095::$$$message_0531_0012_0000$$$::"I disposed of Saber. I can't let them take over any more Servants."::
59096::$$$message_0531_0013_0000$$$::A familiar voice speaks from very close to me.::
59097::$$$message_0531_0014_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
59098::$$$message_0531_0014_0001$$$::I look up, fighting the dizziness.::
59099::$$$message_0531_0015_0000$$$::"Sorry, big brother. I wanted to play with you more, but the situation is different now. Blame the flawed Holy Grail, not me."::
59100::$$$message_0531_0016_0000$$$::The ringing invades my brain.[lr]::
59101::$$$message_0531_0016_0001$$$::Sound waves that should be imperceptible burrow behind my eyeballs and block off my eyesight.::
59102::$$$message_0531_0016_0002$$$::"But don't worry. I won't kill you right away.[lr]::
59103::$$$message_0531_0016_0003$$$::You're going to be my trump card against them. I'll destroy your body here, but I'll swap your mind into one of my puppets.[lr]::
59104::$$$message_0531_0016_0004$$$::...Heehee. You won't be able to move anymore, but it beats dying, doesn't it?"::
59105::$$$message_0531_0017_0000$$$::    The noise permeates my entire body.[lr]::
59106::$$$message_0531_0017_0001$$$::My mind remains as stiff as stone.[lr]::
59107::$$$message_0531_0017_0002$$$::In the darkness, deprived of all five senses, I can't even tell how badly it's over for me.::
