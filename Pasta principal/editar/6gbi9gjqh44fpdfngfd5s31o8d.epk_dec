20130::$$$message_0185_0000_0000$$$::With the enemy defeated, only one task remains.::
20131::$$$message_0185_0001_0000$$$::The dark hollow in the sky.[lr]::
20132::$$$message_0185_0001_0001$$$::The mud has stopped pouring from it, but that eerie void continues to quicken.[lr]::
20133::$$$message_0185_0001_0002$$$::It's the Holy Grail.[lr]::
20134::$$$message_0185_0001_0003$$$::The omnipotent Grail said to be given to the winner of this war.::
20135::$$$message_0185_0002_0000$$$::The wind howls.[lr]::
20136::$$$message_0185_0002_0001$$$::With Kotomine gone, the power binding Illya vanishes.[lr]::
20137::$$$message_0185_0002_0002$$$::Illya's been released from the hollow, and now she sleeps beside me.::
20138::$$$message_0185_0003_0000$$$::She doesn't seem to be in danger of dying.[lr]::
20139::$$$message_0185_0003_0001$$$::She'll probably wake up after we go home and have Tohsaka look her over.::
20140::$$$message_0185_0004_0000$$$::...The war has ended.[lr]::
20141::$$$message_0185_0004_0001$$$::No one else will get hurt. We won't have to lose anyone else now.[lr]::
20142::$$$message_0185_0004_0002$$$::No more Masters, and the Servants will disappear now that their roles are over.::
20143::$$$message_0185_0005_0000$$$::I knew this was going to happen.[lr]::
20144::$$$message_0185_0005_0001$$$::I climbed those long stairs with her earlier.[lr]::
20145::$$$message_0185_0005_0002$$$::We've already said our goodbyes.[lr]::
20146::$$$message_0185_0005_0003$$$::All that's left is to bring the curtain down on this whole war.::
20147::$$$message_0185_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20148::$$$message_0185_0006_0001$$$::I look up at the hollow and wait, my heart as empty as that void.[lr]::
20149::$$$message_0185_0006_0002$$$::And then she appears.[lr]::
20150::$$$message_0185_0006_0003$$$::She walks straight towards me, looking no different than when we first met.::
20151::$$$message_0185_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20152::$$$message_0185_0007_0001$$$::She stops once we're close enough to touch each other.[lr]::
20153::$$$message_0185_0007_0002$$$::We neither ask about each other's well-being, nor offer any congratulations.[lr]::
20154::$$$message_0185_0007_0003$$$::This has already been decided.[lr]::
20155::$$$message_0185_0007_0004$$$::There's only one thing left to do.::
20156::$$$message_0185_0008_0000$$$::"I will destroy the Holy Grail. That is my role."[lr]::
20157::$$$message_0185_0008_0001$$$::Saber starts walking forward.[lr]::
20158::$$$message_0185_0008_0002$$$::The strong winds coming from the hollow do not deter her. She approaches, one step at a time.::
20159::$$$message_0185_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20160::$$$message_0185_0009_0001$$$::She's within range.[lr]::
20161::$$$message_0185_0009_0002$$$::She quietly readies her sword and looks up at the black hollow.::
20162::$$$message_0185_0010_0000$$$::I just watch from where I stand.[lr]::
20163::$$$message_0185_0010_0001$$$::I clench my fists so hard they bleed, I bite my lip, and I try to hold back the feelings fighting for expression... I try to burn the image of her into my mind.[lr]::
20164::$$$message_0185_0010_0002$$$::And then...::
20165::$$$message_0185_0011_0000$$$::"Master, your orders, please. Without your order, I cannot destroy that thing."[lr]::
20166::$$$message_0185_0011_0001$$$::Her back still to me, she tells me to use my final Command Spell.::
20167::$$$message_0185_0012_0000$$$::When the Holy Grail is destroyed, Saber will disappear.[lr]::
20168::$$$message_0185_0012_0001$$$::No...since Saber will destroy the Holy Grail with her own hands, she won't have to become a Servant.::
20169::$$$message_0185_0013_0000$$$::She only became a Servant because she sought the Holy Grail.[lr]::
20170::$$$message_0185_0013_0001$$$::Destroying the Holy Grail should also void her contract, since she will have chosen to do it.[lr]::
20171::$$$message_0185_0013_0002$$$::The moment she destroys the Holy Grail...[lr]::
20172::$$$message_0185_0013_0003$$$::...her life will end, but she will remain king forever.::
20173::$$$message_0185_0014_0000$$$::"Shirou. I would like to hear it from your own lips."[lr]::
20174::$$$message_0185_0014_0001$$$::I hear Saber.[lr]::
20175::$$$message_0185_0014_0002$$$::Every time I hear her voice, I want to scream.[lr]::
20176::$$$message_0185_0014_0003$$$::I want to tell her not to go.[lr]::
20177::$$$message_0185_0014_0004$$$::I want to scream my real, honest desire: I want her to stay.::
20178::$$$message_0185_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20179::$$$message_0185_0015_0001$$$::And yet...[lr]::
20180::$$$message_0185_0015_0002$$$::I can't ever, ever say that.::
20181::$$$message_0185_0016_0000$$$::I love Saber.[lr]::
20182::$$$message_0185_0016_0001$$$::I want her to be happy more than anything else, and I want to be with her forever.[lr]::
20183::$$$message_0185_0016_0002$$$::But if I really love her, that's not what I should be doing.[lr]::
20184::$$$message_0185_0016_0003$$$::I love Saber...for fighting her hardest, even when she was wounded.[lr]::
20185::$$$message_0185_0016_0004$$$::She gave up everything, and while she was torn apart, she still held to her conviction. Even to the very end.::
20186::$$$message_0185_0017_0000$$$::If I think that is beautiful... If I think that is something worth protecting...[lr]::
20187::$$$message_0185_0017_0001$$$::...then I can't destroy everything she stood for just for my own happiness.::
20188::$$$message_0185_0018_0000$$$::She was born a king, and that's how she lived.[lr]::
20189::$$$message_0185_0018_0001$$$::Nothing can change that. From the moment she drew the sword and made her vow, she was king. Nothing else.[lr]::
20190::$$$message_0185_0018_0002$$$::That is her conviction.[lr]::
20191::$$$message_0185_0018_0003$$$::She fought her battles until the very end, believing she was doing the right thing.::
20192::$$$message_0185_0019_0000$$$::The dream of a young girl named Altria...[lr]::
20193::$$$message_0185_0019_0001$$$::She abandoned her own life and chose to be king.[lr]::
20194::$$$message_0185_0019_0002$$$::She chose to fight.[lr]::
20195::$$$message_0185_0019_0003$$$::Even when she was told that everything she does would go unrewarded, she still wielded the sword and kept to her vow as king.[lr]::
20196::$$$message_0185_0019_0004$$$::That lasted for many years...[lr]::
20197::$$$message_0185_0019_0005$$$::I can't do anything to tarnish the pride she held to until her final moments.::
20198::$$$message_0185_0020_0000$$$::"Saber. Fulfill your duty, please."[lr]::
20199::$$$message_0185_0020_0001$$$::My voice is heavy with emotion.::
20200::$$$message_0185_0021_0000$$$::Light flares around us.[lr]::
20201::$$$message_0185_0021_0001$$$::The brilliant ray cuts the hollow in front of us in half, leaving no trace of it.::
20202::$$$message_0185_0022_0000$$$::Nothing remains.[lr]::
20203::$$$message_0185_0022_0001$$$::The mountain's summit has been blasted away, leaving only a smoldering wasteland behind.[lr]::
20204::$$$message_0185_0022_0002$$$::In the distance, the first rays of dawn light the sky.[lr]::
20205::$$$message_0185_0022_0003$$$::A glimmer of gold peeks over the horizon.::
20206::$$$message_0185_0023_0000$$$::"[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]"[lr]::
20207::$$$message_0185_0023_0001$$$::My left hand hurts.[lr]::
20208::$$$message_0185_0023_0002$$$::The final Command Spell disappears.[lr]::
20209::$$$message_0185_0023_0003$$$::And then...[lr]::
20210::$$$message_0185_0023_0004$$$::I accept that it is finally over.::
20211::$$$message_0185_0024_0000$$$::"So, it has come to an end."[lr]::
20212::$$$message_0185_0024_0001$$$::"Yeah. This is the end. There's nothing left."::
20213::$$$message_0185_0025_0000$$$::"I see. Then our contract has also ended. I was your sword, I defeated your enemies, and protected you.[lr]::
20214::$$$message_0185_0025_0001$$$::I am glad I could keep that pledge."::
20215::$$$message_0185_0026_0000$$$::"Yeah. You did well, Saber."[lr]::
20216::$$$message_0185_0026_0001$$$::I don't know what else to say.[lr]::
20217::$$$message_0185_0026_0002$$$::Saber is far away. I don't try to run to her.::
20218::$$$message_0185_0027_0000$$$::The sun rises.[lr]::
20219::$$$message_0185_0027_0001$$$::The wind starts to pick up.[lr]::
20220::$$$message_0185_0027_0002$$$::A golden glimmer shines, seeming to last forever.[lr]::
20221::$$$message_0185_0027_0003$$$::In it...[lr]::
20222::$$$message_0185_0027_0004$$$::"There is one thing I must tell you."[lr]::
20223::$$$message_0185_0027_0005$$$::I can hear the determination in her voice.::
20224::$$$message_0185_0028_0000$$$::"Yeah, what is it?"[lr]::
20225::$$$message_0185_0028_0001$$$::I try to at least sound strong.[lr]::
20226::$$$message_0185_0028_0002$$$::Saber sways.::
20227::$$$message_0185_0029_0000$$$::She turns.[lr]::
20228::$$$message_0185_0029_0001$$$::Saber looks straight at me and says, her voice clear,[lr]::
20229::$$$message_0185_0029_0002$$$::                                              "I love you, Shirou."[lr]::
20230::$$$message_0185_0029_0003$$$::She...said it.::
20231::$$$message_0185_0030_0000$$$::The wind blows over the mountaintop.[lr]::
20232::$$$message_0185_0030_0001$$$::For a moment, I close my eyes, blinded by the morning sun. Then I open them again.::
20233::$$$message_0185_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20234::$$$message_0185_0031_0001$$$::I don't think I was surprised.[lr]::
20235::$$$message_0185_0031_0002$$$::I just had a feeling.[lr]::
20236::$$$message_0185_0031_0003$$$::Our goodbye...[lr]::
20237::$$$message_0185_0031_0004$$$::...was always going to be like this.::
20238::$$$message_0185_0032_0000$$$::All I see is the wasteland.[lr]::
20239::$$$message_0185_0032_0001$$$::Saber is gone, carried off by the gusting wind.[lr]::
20240::$$$message_0185_0032_0002$$$::Just like when she appeared.[lr]::
20241::$$$message_0185_0032_0003$$$::She left with grace, without a trace.::
20242::$$$message_0185_0033_0000$$$::"Yeah...that's so like you."[lr]::
20243::$$$message_0185_0033_0001$$$::There are no regrets in my voice.[lr]::
20244::$$$message_0185_0033_0002$$$::Every memory, both of what I've lost and of what I've gained, remains in my heart. I'll keep them all there. Forever.::
20245::$$$message_0185_0034_0000$$$::I look out at the rising sun, hoping I never forget any of this, that none of it fades from my mind for a long time to come.::
20246::$$$message_0185_0035_0000$$$::I watch the morning glow spreading over the distant land below.[lr]::
20247::$$$message_0185_0035_0001$$$::It reminds me of the golden fields she'd fought on.[nolr][p]::»÷
