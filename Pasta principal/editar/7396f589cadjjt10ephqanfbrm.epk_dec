42810::$$$message_0378_0000_0000$$$::"...Ungh."[lr]::
42811::$$$message_0378_0000_0001$$$::I hold my breath.[lr]::
42812::$$$message_0378_0000_0002$$$::I push my body against the wall and watch while keeping myself hidden.[lr]::
42813::$$$message_0378_0000_0003$$$::...It's still too early.[lr]::
42814::$$$message_0378_0000_0004$$$::It's too reckless to attack when I don't yet have a grasp of what kind of situation it is.::
42815::$$$message_0378_0001_0000$$$::More importantly, I don't have much at hand.[lr]::
42816::$$$message_0378_0001_0001$$$::The only weapon I have is this Strengthened bamboo sword. It's too reckless to confront Caster with only this weapon and without a plan.[lr]::
42817::$$$message_0378_0001_0002$$$::   No, that's wrong.[lr]::
42818::$$$message_0378_0001_0003$$$::I do have another weapon.::
42819::$$$message_0378_0002_0000$$$::"...No way. What am I thinking?"[lr]::
42820::$$$message_0378_0002_0001$$$::I can't use Projection.[lr]::
42821::$$$message_0378_0002_0002$$$::Half of my body got numb just by using it once.[lr]::
42822::$$$message_0378_0002_0003$$$::Archer said so too that it'll end up worse if I use it again.::
42823::$$$message_0378_0003_0000$$$::Magecraft beyond one's capabilities destroys the user first. [lr]::
42824::$$$message_0378_0003_0001$$$::If I use Projection magecraft in this state, it's only natural that I'd die on the spot.[lr]::
42825::$$$message_0378_0003_0002$$$::"...The chance will come. For now..."[lr]::
42826::$$$message_0378_0003_0003$$$::I just have to suppress my body that wants to run out and prepare for that chance.::
42827::$$$message_0378_0004_0000$$$::"...I see. So you killed Kirei?"[lr]::
42828::$$$message_0378_0004_0001$$$::There is only intent to kill in her tense voice.[lr]::
42829::$$$message_0378_0004_0002$$$::Tohsaka is glaring at the enemy in front of her with a coldness I've never seen before.::
42830::$$$message_0378_0005_0000$$$::"Yes, I got rid of him. He did not seem like the type of person that would amenably hand me the Holy Grail. It would be troublesome if he got in the way later on."[lr]::
42831::$$$message_0378_0005_0001$$$::On the other hand, Caster is composed.[lr]::
42832::$$$message_0378_0005_0002$$$::The witch declares loudly that she has killed him herself.::
42833::$$$message_0378_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42834::$$$message_0378_0006_0001$$$::A gritting sound echoes through the sanctuary.[lr]::
42835::$$$message_0378_0006_0002$$$::...That man was more like the devil than a saint to me, but to Tohsaka, that priest was a fellow senior apprentice.[lr]::
42836::$$$message_0378_0006_0003$$$::And he was killed.[lr]::
42837::$$$message_0378_0006_0004$$$::Even if he was involved and prepared as a mage, it's not something she can take in so easily.::
42838::$$$message_0378_0007_0000$$$::"...I see. That's fine. Kirei should have been prepared for such a thing. But Caster, let me ask you one thing. Did you check his corpse?"::
42839::$$$message_0378_0008_0000$$$::I don't know if she was suppressing her anger, or if I was mistaken and she had held no anger from the start.[lr]::
42840::$$$message_0378_0008_0001$$$::Tohsaka questions, as if it doesn't concern her, and Caster dodges her question, completely changing.::
42841::$$$message_0378_0009_0000$$$::"...What are you saying? That has nothing to do with you."::
42842::$$$message_0378_0010_0000$$$::"No, it doesn't. But it's not totally unrelated to me. I just wanted to make sure, since I'll be relieved if he really is dead."[lr]::
42843::$$$message_0378_0010_0001$$$::"...What do you mean by that, young lady?"::
42844::$$$message_0378_0011_0000$$$::"Just as it sounds, Caster.[lr]::
42845::$$$message_0378_0011_0001$$$::As if he's the type to die that easily. I just thought that he's definitely alive if you didn't clearly check the corpse."::
42846::$$$message_0378_0012_0000$$$::"Ugh, you're useless too. If you're going to attack Kirei, you should at least make sure he's dead.[lr]::
42847::$$$message_0378_0012_0001$$$::Whatever. I have something to do now, so let's get this over with, Caster. There's no hostage this time, so we can fight freely."::
42848::$$$message_0378_0013_0000$$$::   A signal to start.[lr]::
42849::$$$message_0378_0013_0001$$$::Tohsaka or Caster.[lr]::
42850::$$$message_0378_0013_0002$$$::If either of them steps forward, the sanctuary will immediately be covered in flames of magecraft...::
42851::$$$message_0378_0014_0000$$$::"You talk big. Do you think you can win against us in this situation?"::
42852::$$$message_0378_0015_0000$$$::"It depends on how I do it. Fortunately, it seems like you haven't controlled Saber yet, so the conditions are the same.[lr]::
42853::$$$message_0378_0015_0001$$$::And I know about Mr. Kuzuki. Saber was taken by surprise, but he's no match for Archer now that we've watched him fight."[lr]::
42854::$$$message_0378_0015_0002$$$::Tohsaka gestures towards Archer while staring at Caster.::
42855::$$$message_0378_0016_0000$$$::"You heard it, Archer.[lr]::
42856::$$$message_0378_0016_0001$$$::I'll take on Caster. She might break your contract too if you get too close to her."[lr]::
42857::$$$message_0378_0016_0002$$$::"...Hm. So my opponent is that man?[lr]::
42858::$$$message_0378_0016_0003$$$::I don't mind, but... Do you understand that a mage is no match for Caster, Rin?"::
42859::$$$message_0378_0017_0000$$$::"...Don't worry, I wouldn't suggest anything I didn't have a chance at winning.[lr]::
42860::$$$message_0378_0017_0001$$$::I'll defeat Caster here for sure. Then Saber can go back to normal, and Shirou can make a contract with her again, right?"[lr]::
42861::$$$message_0378_0017_0002$$$::   Tohsaka gets ready to fight.[lr]::
42862::$$$message_0378_0017_0003$$$::I feel a sense of urgency like a wild animal about to attack its prey.::
42863::$$$message_0378_0018_0000$$$::As if to stop that...[lr]::
42864::$$$message_0378_0018_0001$$$::"That's wishful thinking. It'd be difficult to defeat her here.[lr]::
42865::$$$message_0378_0018_0002$$$::She is the expert at running away. She even tore apart her own younger brother for the sake of escaping."[lr]::
42866::$$$message_0378_0018_0003$$$::Archer nonchalantly steps in between Tohsaka and Caster.::
42867::$$$message_0378_0019_0000$$$::"Archer...? What are you doing?"[lr]::
42868::$$$message_0378_0019_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42869::$$$message_0378_0019_0002$$$::He does not answer Tohsaka.[lr]::
42870::$$$message_0378_0019_0003$$$::The red knight confronts Caster silently, just like last time.::
42871::$$$message_0378_0020_0000$$$::That scenery...[lr]::
42872::$$$message_0378_0020_0001$$$::I think... I remember seeing it somewhere...::
42873::$$$message_0378_0021_0000$$$::"...Tore apart my own younger brother you said...?[lr]::
42874::$$$message_0378_0021_0001$$$::You talk as if you know me, Archer. Do you know my true identity?"::
42875::$$$message_0378_0022_0000$$$::"I hear that humanoid spirits bound to dragon fangs were King Colchis' magecraft.[lr]::
42876::$$$message_0378_0022_0001$$$::I hear that his daughter, Princess Medea, was famed to be an extraordinary witch."[lr]::
42877::$$$message_0378_0022_0002$$$::   The air freezes.[lr]::
42878::$$$message_0378_0022_0003$$$::Caster's composure disappears and enmity like fire is directed at Archer.::
42879::$$$message_0378_0023_0000$$$::"...Yes.[lr]::
42880::$$$message_0378_0023_0001$$$::Then, you should know which one of us is at an advantage, right?"[lr]::
42881::$$$message_0378_0023_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42882::$$$message_0378_0023_0003$$$::Archer does not answer.[lr]::
42883::$$$message_0378_0023_0004$$$::His expression is stony, as if he is accepting everything that is happening. As if there is no good or evil. ::
42884::$$$message_0378_0024_0000$$$::"Resistance is pointless, Archer.[lr]::
42885::$$$message_0378_0024_0001$$$::You cannot take Saber back no matter who you may be. She still has the will to go against me, but that should not last for another day.[lr]::
42886::$$$message_0378_0024_0002$$$::Besides... I can make her into my puppet now if I use my Command Spell."::
42887::$$$message_0378_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42888::$$$message_0378_0025_0001$$$::I strain to keep myself from getting up.[lr]::
42889::$$$message_0378_0025_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...Not yet.[font italic=false][lr]::
42890::$$$message_0378_0025_0003$$$::Even if that's true, I need to endure.[lr]::
42891::$$$message_0378_0025_0004$$$::If I want to save Saber, I can't jump out now...::
42892::$$$message_0378_0026_0000$$$::"...Heh. Saber will be able to withstand it even if you use a Command Spell. I don't know if it'll be a minute or two.[lr]::
42893::$$$message_0378_0026_0001$$$::But, it should be enough time to beat you."::
42894::$$$message_0378_0027_0000$$$::Caster and Tohsaka glare at each other, using Archer as the fulcrum.[lr]::
42895::$$$message_0378_0027_0001$$$::Standing in between them...::
42896::$$$message_0378_0028_0000$$$::"That's impossible. Even if we attack you, we can only take away half your powers at most.[lr]::
42897::$$$message_0378_0028_0001$$$::What awaits us is a disadvantageous situation where we would be fighting both you and Saber."[lr]::
42898::$$$message_0378_0028_0002$$$::Yes, he defied his own Master's expectations.::
42899::$$$message_0378_0029_0000$$$::"Archer, that is[line2]"[lr]::
42900::$$$message_0378_0029_0001$$$::"You should know, Rin. We have no chance at winning if that happens.[lr]::
42901::$$$message_0378_0029_0002$$$::Saber's abilities were limited because of her incomplete Master. Now that she does not have that limitation anymore, she is the strongest Servant. Only Berserker can match her."::
42902::$$$message_0378_0030_0000$$$::He speaks in a matter-of-fact manner.[lr]::
42903::$$$message_0378_0030_0001$$$::Tohsaka stares at Archer, stunned.[lr]::
42904::$$$message_0378_0030_0002$$$::Even Caster is puzzled by her sensible enemy.::
42905::$$$message_0378_0031_0000$$$::But not me.[lr]::
42906::$$$message_0378_0031_0001$$$::I've experienced something similar like this before.::
42907::$$$message_0378_0032_0000$$$::"Could he be...?"[lr]::
42908::$$$message_0378_0032_0001$$$::A bad feeling occupies my thoughts.[lr]::
42909::$$$message_0378_0032_0002$$$::That time at the temple...[lr]::
42910::$$$message_0378_0032_0003$$$:: [font italic=true]When he was confronting Caster and she told him to join her, how did he turn her down?[font italic=false]::
42911::$$$message_0378_0033_0000$$$::"...Don't."[lr]::
42912::$$$message_0378_0033_0001$$$::I mutter without realizing.[lr]::
42913::$$$message_0378_0033_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Don't do it.[font italic=false][lr]::
42914::$$$message_0378_0033_0003$$$::It's not because the situation will get worse.[lr]::
42915::$$$message_0378_0033_0004$$$::[font italic=true]You're Tohsaka's partner.[font italic=false][lr]::
42916::$$$message_0378_0033_0005$$$::[font italic=true]So don't do it.[font italic=false][lr]::
42917::$$$message_0378_0033_0006$$$::If that happens... I don't... know what kind of expression she'll make.::
42918::$$$message_0378_0034_0000$$$::Archer steps forward.[lr]::
42919::$$$message_0378_0034_0001$$$::He is only empty-handed.[lr]::
42920::$$$message_0378_0034_0002$$$::He steps forward without any enmity or intent to kill, and...::
42921::$$$message_0378_0035_0000$$$::"...Don't resent me, brat.[lr]::
42922::$$$message_0378_0035_0001$$$::There's no other option at this point, right?"::
42923::$$$message_0378_0036_0000$$$::He looks and smiles at me as if he noticed that I was peeking.::
42924::$$$message_0378_0037_0000$$$::"Well, Caster. Let me ask you one thing. Do you have room for one more Servant?"[lr]::
42925::$$$message_0378_0037_0001$$$::"Archer, you...!"::
42926::$$$message_0378_0038_0000$$$::"Heh... Hehe, haha, hahahahahahahaha!"[lr]::
42927::$$$message_0378_0038_0001$$$::Caster laughs like it's the funniest thing she's heard, and Archer's back is like steel.[lr]::
42928::$$$message_0378_0038_0002$$$::At that, Tohsaka...::
42929::$$$message_0378_0039_0000$$$::   Doesn't look away.[lr]::
42930::$$$message_0378_0039_0001$$$::It should be fine for her to break down at a time like this, but she tries her best to act strong and clenches her teeth.::
42931::$$$message_0378_0040_0000$$$::"Yes, of course. I have the capacity for not only one, but to handle all Servants. You know where I am replenishing my magical energy from, right?"::
42932::$$$message_0378_0041_0000$$$::Magical energy that allows her to sustain seven Servants.[lr]::
42933::$$$message_0378_0041_0001$$$::That is the life being pumped from the people of this town.::
42934::$$$message_0378_0042_0000$$$:: "Then this should be easy. I shall accept that offer you made before, Caster."[lr]::
42935::$$$message_0378_0042_0001$$$::He holds out his hand to Caster in assent.::
42936::$$$message_0378_0043_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42937::$$$message_0378_0043_0001$$$::I thought I was going to break down.[lr]::
42938::$$$message_0378_0043_0002$$$::   I can't forgive him.[lr]::
42939::$$$message_0378_0043_0003$$$::For betraying Tohsaka.[lr]::
42940::$$$message_0378_0043_0004$$$::And for approving of Caster and joining her.::
42941::$$$message_0378_0044_0000$$$::   A hero...[lr]::
42942::$$$message_0378_0044_0001$$$::Even if the hero that saved many people and embodies my ideals is a man like that... ::
42943::$$$message_0378_0045_0000$$$::"Even though you turned it down that time? You act rather quickly."::
42944::$$$message_0378_0046_0000$$$::"The situation changed.[lr]::
42945::$$$message_0378_0046_0001$$$::If Saber is on your side, you have a chance of winning this Holy Grail War. It is a natural course of action to go to the winning side, right?"::
42946::$$$message_0378_0047_0000$$$::Archer walks to Caster, defenseless.[lr]::
42947::$$$message_0378_0047_0001$$$::That means he's leaving Tohsaka.[lr]::
42948::$$$message_0378_0047_0002$$$::Tohsaka doesn't stop him and stares at the enemy in front of her on full alert.::
42949::$$$message_0378_0048_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42950::$$$message_0378_0048_0001$$$::I recognize her appearance.[lr]::
42951::$$$message_0378_0048_0002$$$::The red classroom.[lr]::
42952::$$$message_0378_0048_0003$$$:: She tried to hide her shaking legs and continued to be Rin Tohsaka, even with the collapsed students in front of her.::
42953::$$$message_0378_0049_0000$$$::...That is her strength and weakness.[lr]::
42954::$$$message_0378_0049_0001$$$::She always tries to act brave in any situation, so those around her get the wrong idea that she's a strong person.::
42955::$$$message_0378_0050_0000$$$::"Now, use your contract breaker. Rin still has her Command Spell. She will attack you if you don't hurry."::
42956::$$$message_0378_0051_0000$$$::His banter doesn't change.[lr]::
42957::$$$message_0378_0051_0001$$$::He betrayed Tohsaka in front of her, yet he's still acting like before.[lr]::
42958::$$$message_0378_0051_0002$$$::She must've felt wariness towards the opponent.[lr]::
42959::$$$message_0378_0051_0003$$$:: Caster takes out that oddly shaped dagger, but does not try to stab Archer with it.::
42960::$$$message_0378_0052_0000$$$::"What is it? You are able to obtain a loyal subordinate without effort.[lr]::
42961::$$$message_0378_0052_0001$$$::Why do you need to hesitate?"[lr]::
42962::$$$message_0378_0052_0002$$$::"...I don't know about that. I do not trust traitors. If your words are correct, then isn't Saber the only piece I need?"::
42963::$$$message_0378_0053_0000$$$::"You don't trust traitors, huh?[lr]::
42964::$$$message_0378_0053_0001$$$::It is true that I may betray you. I am going to your side for my own sake. I have not accepted you as my Master. But[line2]"::
42965::$$$message_0378_0054_0000$$$::"Command Spells are to punish traitors, right?[lr]::
42966::$$$message_0378_0054_0001$$$::...Fine. I need to prove to the world that I am great enough to take you in. I was interested in your Noble Phantasm from the start, so I shall go with your plan."::
42967::$$$message_0378_0055_0000$$$::Caster raises her arm.[lr]::
42968::$$$message_0378_0055_0001$$$::The dagger in her hand that breaks contracts is thrust at Archer's chest in a single line.::
42969::$$$message_0378_0056_0000$$$::"Ungh...!"[lr]::
42970::$$$message_0378_0056_0001$$$::Tohsaka grimaces.[lr]::
42971::$$$message_0378_0056_0002$$$::It must be a reaction to having the contract broken by force.[lr]::
42972::$$$message_0378_0056_0003$$$::But, this isn't the time to be hesitating over something like that.[lr]::
42973::$$$message_0378_0056_0004$$$::This has become the worst possible situation.::
42974::$$$message_0378_0057_0000$$$::Tohsaka slightly retreats, still staring at them.[lr]::
42975::$$$message_0378_0057_0001$$$::...Tohsaka is calm.[lr]::
42976::$$$message_0378_0057_0002$$$::She understands that it would do no good to fight them now.[lr]::
42977::$$$message_0378_0057_0003$$$::If she wants to keep on fighting, she has to retreat for now.::
42978::$$$message_0378_0058_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42979::$$$message_0378_0058_0001$$$::But, there are six meters between Tohsaka and the stairs.[lr]::
42980::$$$message_0378_0058_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Is it possible for her to run that distance all at once?[font italic=false]::
42981::$$$message_0378_0059_0000$$$::   It's impossible.[lr]::
42982::$$$message_0378_0059_0001$$$::It's obvious, looking from above.[lr]::
42983::$$$message_0378_0059_0002$$$::Kuzuki, who has been silent up to now, focuses his attention towards Tohsaka.[lr]::
42984::$$$message_0378_0059_0003$$$::[font italic=true]If she turns around and sprints full speed, would she be able to reach the stairs and get to the exit while dodging Kuzuki?[font italic=false]::
42985::$$$message_0378_0060_0000$$$::Tohsaka snorts, still staring at them.[lr]::
42986::$$$message_0378_0060_0001$$$::Her face...[lr]::
42987::$$$message_0378_0060_0002$$$::"Heh... Of course that's impossible."[lr]::
