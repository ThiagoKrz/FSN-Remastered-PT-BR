63974::$$$message_0588_0001_0000$$$::Water covers the familiar landscape, making the town seem like a fish tank.[lr]::
63975::$$$message_0588_0001_0001$$$::There is no air. Each time it breathes, something dark coils in its throat.[lr]::
63976::$$$message_0588_0001_0002$$$::It craves oxygen, but the harder it tries to breathe, the more the heavy air fills its lungs like water.[lr]::
63977::$$$message_0588_0001_0003$$$::So it's not different from being in the ocean.::
63978::$$$message_0588_0002_0000$$$::It pants, feeling suffocated.[lr]::
63979::$$$message_0588_0002_0001$$$::It was meant to live on land. It wasn't born in the sea.[lr]::
63980::$$$message_0588_0002_0002$$$::Seeking to exit the water, it climbs toward the highest place in town.[lr]::
63981::$$$message_0588_0002_0003$$$::Still, it feels breathless.[lr]::
63982::$$$message_0588_0002_0004$$$::Looking down at the vast cityscape, its throat burns due to lack of oxygen, and its suffering causes it to despise the peacefully sleeping city.::
63983::$$$message_0588_0003_0000$$$::CAN'T BREATHE. CAN'T BREATHE. CAN'T BREATHE.[lr]::
63984::$$$message_0588_0003_0001$$$::There is no air here.[lr]::
63985::$$$message_0588_0003_0002$$$::There is no pain here.[lr]::
63986::$$$message_0588_0003_0003$$$::CAN'T BREATHE. CAN'T BREATHE. CAN'T BREATHE. CAN'T BREATHE.[lr]::
63987::$$$message_0588_0003_0004$$$::It's dragging something.[lr]::
63988::$$$message_0588_0003_0005$$$::The body is bewitchingly slippery and colorful.[lr]::
63989::$$$message_0588_0003_0006$$$::CAN'T BREATHE. CAN'T BREATHE. NOT ENOUGH. CAN'T BREATHE.::
63990::$$$message_0588_0004_0000$$$::Dark hands gather several corpses.[lr]::
63991::$$$message_0588_0004_0001$$$::Crooked hands squeeze several corpses.::
63992::$$$message_0588_0005_0000$$$::                    NOT ENOUGH. NOT ENOUGH. NOT ENOUGH. NOT ENOUGH.::
63993::$$$message_0588_0006_0000$$$::With a squishing noise, something splashes all over it.[lr]::
63994::$$$message_0588_0006_0001$$$::It lacks oxygen.[lr]::
63995::$$$message_0588_0006_0002$$$::It's hard to breathe oxygen.[lr]::
63996::$$$message_0588_0006_0003$$$::The water pressure doesn't care.[lr]::
63997::$$$message_0588_0006_0004$$$::The water pressure is unbearable.[lr]::
63998::$$$message_0588_0006_0005$$$::Flowing liquid covers its body.[lr]::
63999::$$$message_0588_0006_0006$$$::Most likely, it believes that this is the waterproof suit it needs to survive in this ocean.::
64000::$$$message_0588_0007_0000$$$::It reaches out with its warped hands.[lr]::
64001::$$$message_0588_0007_0001$$$::Moonlit, dark hands become a giant shadow, descending to crush a part of the town...::
64002::$$$message_0588_0008_0000$$$::"Ah, ahh...!"[lr]::
64003::$$$message_0588_0008_0001$$$::She wakes from her sleep.[lr]::
64004::$$$message_0588_0008_0002$$$::She gasps for air.[lr]::
64005::$$$message_0588_0008_0003$$$::Aghast at the shockingly realistic dream, she hugs her burning hot body.[lr]::
64006::$$$message_0588_0008_0004$$$::Suddenly, she feels something wet.[lr]::
64007::$$$message_0588_0008_0005$$$::Both of her hands are covered in dark red.::
64008::$$$message_0588_0009_0000$$$::"Ah, aahhh!"[lr]::
64009::$$$message_0588_0009_0001$$$::She shuts her eyes and thrusts her hands away from herself.[lr]::
64010::$$$message_0588_0009_0002$$$::...When she warily opens them again, her hands are clean.[lr]::
64011::$$$message_0588_0009_0003$$$::Even if it was just a hallucination, she can't stop shaking.::
64012::$$$message_0588_0010_0000$$$::She trembles with fear,[lr]::
64013::$$$message_0588_0010_0001$$$::shuddering like a broken machine.[lr]::
64014::$$$message_0588_0010_0002$$$::The shaking might cause the rattling bolts in her ears to fall out.[lr]::
64015::$$$message_0588_0010_0003$$$::She imagines all of her insides falling out one by one, until she's lost too many parts to move anymore. The visual terrifies her so badly she can't stop shaking.::
64016::$$$message_0588_0011_0000$$$::"...My face. That's right, I need to wash my face."[lr]::
64017::$$$message_0588_0011_0001$$$::She goes to the bathroom.[lr]::
64018::$$$message_0588_0011_0002$$$::She can't take more than a few steps.[lr]::
64019::$$$message_0588_0011_0003$$$::Her trembling limbs won't obey her.[lr]::
64020::$$$message_0588_0011_0004$$$::She nearly falls over, bracing herself on a desk.::
64021::$$$message_0588_0012_0000$$$::"...Ah...ah, ngh..."[lr]::
64022::$$$message_0588_0012_0001$$$::Her vision is hazy.[lr]::
64023::$$$message_0588_0012_0002$$$::She can't walk to the door, or even see it clearly.[lr]::
64024::$$$message_0588_0012_0003$$$::She can't remember what she was just dreaming about, or why she got out of bed.::
64025::$$$message_0588_0013_0000$$$::"...Ugh...ah."[lr]::
64026::$$$message_0588_0013_0001$$$::She's breaking.[lr]::
64027::$$$message_0588_0013_0002$$$::She can't remember anything.[lr]::
64028::$$$message_0588_0013_0003$$$::She can't think of anything.[lr]::
64029::$$$message_0588_0013_0004$$$::All she feels is desire and hunger.[lr]::
64030::$$$message_0588_0013_0005$$$::All she wants are warm bodies and kind, gentle words.::
64031::$$$message_0588_0014_0000$$$::"Ah...ugh."[lr]::
64032::$$$message_0588_0014_0001$$$::She slumps against the desk, shaking her head.[lr]::
64033::$$$message_0588_0014_0002$$$::She's filled with fear and boundless self-loathing.[lr]::
64034::$$$message_0588_0014_0003$$$::Something's wrong with her.[lr]::
64035::$$$message_0588_0014_0004$$$::She knows something is wrong with her.[lr]::
64036::$$$message_0588_0014_0005$$$::Why isn't it enough?[lr]::
64037::$$$message_0588_0014_0006$$$::She got more just a few hours ago, but it isn't enough at all.[lr]::
64038::$$$message_0588_0014_0007$$$::She was so happy, thinking there must be no greater joy on Earth. So why isn't it even close to enough?::
64039::$$$message_0588_0015_0000$$$::It must be because of how hollow and empty she is. That's why he isn't enough to fill her up.[lr]::
64040::$$$message_0588_0015_0001$$$::But she doesn't want anyone else to fill her up.[lr]::
64041::$$$message_0588_0015_0002$$$::That's why she wanted to keep becoming his, forever and ever.[lr]::
64042::$$$message_0588_0015_0003$$$::She thought it would be fine if time, if her feelings, if other people, if it all went away, so why didn't she make it happen, it's so mysterious, but she can't help not knowing why, and so she naturally thought that it might be able to do it for her.::
64043::$$$message_0588_0016_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
64044::$$$message_0588_0016_0001$$$::She's giddy.[lr]::
64045::$$$message_0588_0016_0002$$$::It isn't some strange delusion.[lr]::
64046::$$$message_0588_0016_0003$$$::Just for an instant, she thought that sounded fun,[lr]::
64047::$$$message_0588_0016_0004$$$::and that terrifies her.::
64048::$$$message_0588_0017_0000$$$::"Ah... Ugh...urgh...!"[lr]::
64049::$$$message_0588_0017_0001$$$::She steadies herself on the table.[lr]::
64050::$$$message_0588_0017_0002$$$::Her body feels like it's about to fall apart, but she hangs on.[lr]::
64051::$$$message_0588_0017_0003$$$::Day by day, the scary dreams are becoming clearer.[lr]::
64052::$$$message_0588_0017_0004$$$::Day by day, the scary dreams stop being scary.[lr]::
64053::$$$message_0588_0017_0005$$$::That's why she's starting to break.[lr]::
64054::$$$message_0588_0017_0006$$$::Until now, it was only her body.[lr]::
64055::$$$message_0588_0017_0007$$$::But now her mind is starting to go.::
64056::$$$message_0588_0018_0000$$$::"Oooh...oooh, ooooh..."[lr]::
64057::$$$message_0588_0018_0001$$$::She mumbles and weeps, biting her lip.[lr]::
64058::$$$message_0588_0018_0002$$$::It's fine if her memories are vague.[lr]::
64059::$$$message_0588_0018_0003$$$::She doesn't need to remember what happened a few hours ago.[lr]::
64060::$$$message_0588_0018_0004$$$::Her limbs won't listen to her. She isn't afraid of falling asleep forever.::
64061::$$$message_0588_0019_0000$$$::But she doesn't want to stop being herself.[lr]::
64062::$$$message_0588_0019_0001$$$::She doesn't want to be a bad person.[lr]::
64063::$$$message_0588_0019_0002$$$::She'll keep going crazy, bit by bit, until she finally snaps.[lr]::
64064::$$$message_0588_0019_0003$$$::Once that happens, she's sure...that she'll be the greatest cause of his suffering.::
64065::$$$message_0588_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64066::$$$message_0588_0020_0001$$$::She's afraid of that.[lr]::
64067::$$$message_0588_0020_0002$$$::She's afraid of going crazy. It terrifies her more than anything else so far.[lr]::
64068::$$$message_0588_0020_0003$$$::If she loses it, he won't touch her anymore. He won't love her anymore.[lr]::
64069::$$$message_0588_0020_0004$$$::They won't be able to be together anymore, and she won't even know when they are.[lr]::
64070::$$$message_0588_0020_0005$$$::That's not all. If she goes insane, he'll be with some other woman.::
64071::$$$message_0588_0021_0000$$$::She doesn't want that. Not at all.[lr]::
64072::$$$message_0588_0021_0001$$$::She always thought that he deserved someone better, but now she can't allow it to happen.::
64073::$$$message_0588_0022_0000$$$::    After all,[lr]::
64074::$$$message_0588_0022_0001$$$::    he already belongs to her.::
64075::$$$message_0588_0023_0000$$$::...So she's afraid.[lr]::
64076::$$$message_0588_0023_0001$$$::Afraid of not knowing what she'll do once it happens.::
64077::$$$message_0588_0024_0000$$$::"...Oooh...ooo, kh..."[lr]::
64078::$$$message_0588_0024_0001$$$::She knows how bad things are, and there's no way out.[lr]::
64079::$$$message_0588_0024_0002$$$::She can't tell anyone about her problem.[lr]::
64080::$$$message_0588_0024_0003$$$::If she does, she'll just end up back in the cold place she was before.[lr]::
64081::$$$message_0588_0024_0004$$$::She can't go back there, now that she's known warmth.[lr]::
64082::$$$message_0588_0024_0005$$$::She wants more.[lr]::
64083::$$$message_0588_0024_0006$$$::To be here with him, and smile at him.::
64084::$$$message_0588_0025_0000$$$::She knows full well what she'll lose if this goes on.[lr]::
64085::$$$message_0588_0025_0001$$$::Her wish is a simple desire.[lr]::
64086::$$$message_0588_0025_0002$$$::For her own happiness, she has to ruin the one and only person who wants her to become happy.::
64087::$$$message_0588_0026_0000$$$::If she can't do that, then she'll just keep breaking where no one can see her.[lr]::
64088::$$$message_0588_0026_0001$$$::If she's going to go crazy anyway, then she might as well disappear now and turn into a monster while no one else is around.[lr]::
64089::$$$message_0588_0026_0002$$$::Surely, that's the right choice.::
64090::$$$message_0588_0027_0000$$$::But she clings to it.[lr]::
64091::$$$message_0588_0027_0001$$$::Because she's warm. Because she's happy. Because she wants more.[lr]::
64092::$$$message_0588_0027_0002$$$::"Why me?" she wonders.[lr]::
64093::$$$message_0588_0027_0003$$$::Why is she the only one who has to be cut off from such simple wants...?::
64094::$$$message_0588_0028_0000$$$::"No... No, no, no!"[lr]::
64095::$$$message_0588_0028_0001$$$::She shakes off her weakness.[lr]::
64096::$$$message_0588_0028_0002$$$::She isn't jealous.[lr]::
64097::$$$message_0588_0028_0003$$$::She doesn't resent anyone.[lr]::
64098::$$$message_0588_0028_0004$$$::She defends herself[line2]she just wants a little more time.::
64099::$$$message_0588_0029_0000$$$::"No... This...isn't me."[lr]::
64100::$$$message_0588_0029_0001$$$::She shakes her head in denial.[lr]::
64101::$$$message_0588_0029_0002$$$::In her empty head, she covers her dark heart.[lr]::
64102::$$$message_0588_0029_0003$$$::  There's no off-ramp to happiness on this road.[lr]::
64103::$$$message_0588_0029_0004$$$::She turns away from an answer she already knows.::
64104::$$$message_0588_0030_0000$$$::"Ugh...uuugh, ngh..."[lr]::
64105::$$$message_0588_0030_0001$$$::...Her clouded mind has long since fallen into a nightmare.[lr]::
64106::$$$message_0588_0030_0002$$$::She forces herself to stop wishing for someone to help her. She just keeps crying, alone.::
