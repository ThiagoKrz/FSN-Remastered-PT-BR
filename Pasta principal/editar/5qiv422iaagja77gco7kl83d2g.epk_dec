41975::$$$message_0366_0000_0000$$$::The terrace falls.[lr]::
41976::$$$message_0366_0000_0001$$$::The man's Noble Phantasm goes through the wall of the castle and destroys the hall's walls.::
41977::$$$message_0366_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41978::$$$message_0366_0001_0001$$$::I don't move a step in the midst of it all.[lr]::
41979::$$$message_0366_0001_0002$$$::I don't care about the rubble that falls from above.[lr]::
41980::$$$message_0366_0001_0003$$$::I don't have the composure to run, and I have no intention to run.[lr]::
41981::$$$message_0366_0001_0004$$$::It doesn't matter whether a big piece of rubble grazes my back.[lr]::
41982::$$$message_0366_0001_0005$$$::I can't think of taking my eyes off of that man right now.::
41983::$$$message_0366_0002_0000$$$::"...Oh. So it's Saber's Master."[lr]::
41984::$$$message_0366_0002_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41985::$$$message_0366_0002_0002$$$::His red eyes react to my enmity.::
41986::$$$message_0366_0003_0000$$$::   My blood boils.[lr]::
41987::$$$message_0366_0003_0001$$$::I'll die in the next instant. There's no way I'm not afraid of that.[lr]::
41988::$$$message_0366_0003_0002$$$::But my body refuses to run away and keeps screaming to defeat that enemy right now.[lr]::
41989::$$$message_0366_0003_0003$$$::The corpse of the girl that was killed mercilessly keeps ordering me not to forgive him.::
41990::$$$message_0366_0004_0000$$$::It's only natural for me to lose all reasoning.[lr]::
41991::$$$message_0366_0004_0001$$$::My mind churns from the contradicting desires of life and death.::
41992::$$$message_0366_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41993::$$$message_0366_0005_0001$$$::"You seem to have the will to fight but it's no use talking about it. You are worthless without Saber."[lr]::
41994::$$$message_0366_0005_0002$$$::A sword appears in the man's left hand.[lr]::
41995::$$$message_0366_0005_0003$$$::The sword is raised mercilessly and should come down to kill me.::
41996::$$$message_0366_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41997::$$$message_0366_0006_0001$$$::Even then, I keep staring at the enemy.[lr]::
41998::$$$message_0366_0006_0002$$$::I can't think of showing my back to that man.::
41999::$$$message_0366_0007_0000$$$::"...Hold on. I know this guy."[lr]::
42000::$$$message_0366_0007_0001$$$::The man's sword stops.[lr]::
42001::$$$message_0366_0007_0002$$$::Shinji, who was watching from the other side of the wall, starts walking to the center of the hall with light steps.::
42002::$$$message_0366_0008_0000$$$::"Hey, it's been a while, Emiya. I didn't expect to see you here, so I'm a bit surprised."[lr]::
42003::$$$message_0366_0008_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
42004::$$$message_0366_0009_0000$$$::The man doesn't move.[lr]::
42005::$$$message_0366_0009_0001$$$::There's about ten meters between us.[lr]::
42006::$$$message_0366_0009_0002$$$:: ...Would I be able to get near him? Even Berserker could not close this distance.::
42007::$$$message_0366_0010_0000$$$::"Oh, are you so scared you can't even talk!? Well, I understand how you feel. I was the same with Rider.[lr]::
42008::$$$message_0366_0010_0001$$$::Yeah, that's right, that's right! Man, I'm glad you let me go that time, Emiya!"::
42009::$$$message_0366_0011_0000$$$::There's nothing I can use as a weapon.[lr]::
42010::$$$message_0366_0011_0001$$$::But I don't care.[lr]::
42011::$$$message_0366_0011_0002$$$::My mind is clear right now.[lr]::
42012::$$$message_0366_0011_0003$$$:: I don't feel any uneasiness about Projecting his swords in this situation...::
42013::$$$message_0366_0012_0000$$$::"Hey. I'm telling you to look over here...!"[lr]::
42014::$$$message_0366_0012_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
42015::$$$message_0366_0013_0000$$$::...I slightly shift my gaze in his direction.[lr]::
42016::$$$message_0366_0013_0001$$$::I face Shinji, while keeping the man in my vision.::
42017::$$$message_0366_0014_0000$$$::"That's right. So you do know who's the most important one here?"[lr]::
42018::$$$message_0366_0014_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42019::$$$message_0366_0014_0002$$$::I gasp a little.[lr]::
42020::$$$message_0366_0014_0003$$$::It's not Shinji's words, but rather the unexpectedly serious manner in which he says them.::
42021::$$$message_0366_0015_0000$$$::"So that's how it is. You do know right, Emiya? You'll certainly die like this."::
42022::$$$message_0366_0016_0000$$$::...How out-of-place.[lr]::
42023::$$$message_0366_0016_0001$$$::Why say something that's so obvious now?::
42024::$$$message_0366_0017_0000$$$::"I didn't get to introduce him yet, but that's my new Servant. He's more amazing than Rider, right?"[lr]::
42025::$$$message_0366_0017_0001$$$::Shinji puts his hand over the man's shoulder.[lr]::
42026::$$$message_0366_0017_0002$$$::And with a delighted face...[lr]::
42027::$$$message_0366_0017_0003$$$::"Beg for your life, Emiya. I might consider it."[lr]::
42028::$$$message_0366_0017_0004$$$::He says some nonsense. ::
42029::$$$message_0366_0018_0000$$$::"I refuse."[lr]::
42030::$$$message_0366_0018_0001$$$::I have no doubt.[lr]::
42031::$$$message_0366_0018_0002$$$::I answer right away, without showing any hesitation or showing any signs of even considering it.::
42032::$$$message_0366_0019_0000$$$::"Guh...! Fine, then you can die...!"[lr]::
42033::$$$message_0366_0019_0001$$$::Shinji jumps back.::
42034::$$$message_0366_0020_0000$$$::The man, still with a cold expression, finally brings his raised sword dow[line2][lr]::
42035::$$$message_0366_0020_0001$$$::"That's it. I won't guarantee your Master's life if you even move your finger an inch, you Servant."[lr]::
42036::$$$message_0366_0020_0002$$$::    And the man stops his sword again.::
42037::$$$message_0366_0021_0000$$$::Everyone looks up.[lr]::
42038::$$$message_0366_0021_0001$$$::Everyone in the hall turns their attention to the girl standing at the terrace.::
42039::$$$message_0366_0022_0000$$$::Tohsaka's hand is faced towards Shinji.[lr]::
42040::$$$message_0366_0022_0001$$$::Even though Shinji doesn't have the aptitude as a mage, he should know what that means.[lr]::
42041::$$$message_0366_0022_0002$$$::Tohsaka is serious.[lr]::
42042::$$$message_0366_0022_0003$$$::If that man brings down his sword, she will kill Shinji as retaliation.::
42043::$$$message_0366_0023_0000$$$::"T-Tohsaka...! Why are you here...!?"[lr]::
42044::$$$message_0366_0023_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42045::$$$message_0366_0023_0002$$$::Tohsaka doesn't answer, but just keeps her aim aligned on Shinji.::
42046::$$$message_0366_0024_0000$$$::"W-What, are you really going to shoot me, you murderer..!?"[lr]::
42047::$$$message_0366_0024_0001$$$::"You're the one who killed first.[lr]::
42048::$$$message_0366_0024_0002$$$::   Well, whichever it is, that doesn't matter. Shinji. The right to kill and to be killed are the same. You should instinctively understand that as a human, even if you're not a mage."[lr]::
42049::$$$message_0366_0024_0003$$$::"Guh..."[lr]::
42050::$$$message_0366_0024_0004$$$::Shinji weakly retreats, being glared down by Tohsaka.::
42051::$$$message_0366_0025_0000$$$::At that...[lr]::
42052::$$$message_0366_0025_0001$$$::"...Hm."[lr]::
42053::$$$message_0366_0025_0002$$$::That guy is watching in delight.::
42054::$$$message_0366_0026_0000$$$::He looks at Tohsaka, as if to belittle her.[lr]::
42055::$$$message_0366_0026_0001$$$::"...?"[lr]::
42056::$$$message_0366_0026_0002$$$::...Then...[lr]::
42057::$$$message_0366_0026_0003$$$::I feel like there was a strange vibration that took over the hall for an instant.::
42058::$$$message_0366_0027_0000$$$::"I see. You know you will not be able to defeat me, so you went after my Master instead. You brought on the negotiation because you know that I would not stop even if you killed my Master."::
42059::$$$message_0366_0028_0000$$$::"...That's right. You wouldn't stop even if Shinji dies. But you can consider it in this situation, right?[lr]::
42060::$$$message_0366_0028_0001$$$::You can save Shinji right now. You're a Servant, so it should be a hard blow to lose your Master."::
42061::$$$message_0366_0029_0000$$$::"Heh. I see, I see, you are pretty quick-witted. That is the only negotiation if you want to save that mongrel."[lr]::
42062::$$$message_0366_0029_0001$$$::The sword disappears.[lr]::
42063::$$$message_0366_0029_0002$$$::He turns his back to me as if he lost interest in me.::
42064::$$$message_0366_0030_0000$$$::"Guh...! What are you doing!? Who told you to stop...!?"[lr]::
42065::$$$message_0366_0030_0001$$$::"No... The situation changed, Shinji. She will be perfect as a vessel."[lr]::
42066::$$$message_0366_0030_0002$$$::"Huh...?"::
42067::$$$message_0366_0031_0000$$$::Shinji's breath stops.[lr]::
42068::$$$message_0366_0031_0001$$$::His face filled with irritation suddenly turns into a dirty smile.[lr]::
42069::$$$message_0366_0031_0002$$$::"I see... Man, I'm glad that you're alive, Tohsaka."::
42070::$$$message_0366_0032_0000$$$::"Really. I'm relieved as well. I've known you for a long time, even if you're like that. I would be disheartened if you died somewhere."::
42071::$$$message_0366_0033_0000$$$::Laughing happily, Shinji claps his hands.[lr]::
42072::$$$message_0366_0033_0001$$$::...It's strange.[lr]::
42073::$$$message_0366_0033_0002$$$::Shinji shows no fear even though Tohsaka can end his life.[lr]::
42074::$$$message_0366_0033_0003$$$::It seems like an overwhelming joy is numbing his emotions.::
42075::$$$message_0366_0034_0000$$$::"Oh well. That aside, how about this, Tohsaka? Why don't you forget about Emiya and team up with us?"[lr]::
42076::$$$message_0366_0034_0001$$$::"...Us?"::
42077::$$$message_0366_0035_0000$$$::"That's right. You also know how Caster is stocking up power, right? The Ryudou Temple is the altar this time. It's a bit unfavorable for us if she's taking position there and stocking up magical energy."::
42078::$$$message_0366_0036_0000$$$::Shinji says with both arms raised.[lr]::
42079::$$$message_0366_0036_0001$$$::But, that's an obvious fact.[lr]::
42080::$$$message_0366_0036_0002$$$:: On top of that, it seems like Shinji doesn't know about how Caster obtained Saber and Archer.::
42081::$$$message_0366_0037_0000$$$::"See, you can tell right? The chance of victory is slim by myself.[lr]::
42082::$$$message_0366_0037_0001$$$::I beat Berserker's Master, but this isn't enough. We can make something that can even beat Caster if you join us."[lr]::
42083::$$$message_0366_0037_0002$$$::Shinji invites her with confidence.[lr]::
42084::$$$message_0366_0037_0003$$$::To that...::
42085::$$$message_0366_0038_0000$$$::"I refuse, Shinji. I don't know who you're connected with. But I have no reason to follow a guy that is obviously being used."[lr]::
42086::$$$message_0366_0038_0001$$$::Tohsaka refuses him without twitching a brow.::
42087::$$$message_0366_0039_0000$$$::"W-What...?"[lr]::
42088::$$$message_0366_0039_0001$$$::"Can't you tell? I'm warning you since I've known you for a long time, but you should get the intelligence to observe what's going on around you.[lr]::
42089::$$$message_0366_0039_0002$$$::You're the only person that thinks Shinji Matou is a Master. Don't you realize by now that you don't have talent as a mage?"[lr]::
42090::$$$message_0366_0039_0003$$$::"You...!"::
42091::$$$message_0366_0040_0000$$$::Shinji's face twitches.[lr]::
42092::$$$message_0366_0040_0001$$$::Tohsaka's harsh words must've made him forget that his life is in her hands.[lr]::
42093::$$$message_0366_0040_0002$$$::"Do it, Gilgamesh! Kill Emiya and Tohsaka...!"[lr]::
42094::$$$message_0366_0040_0003$$$::Shinji orders to his own Servant.::
42095::$$$message_0366_0041_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42096::$$$message_0366_0041_0001$$$::"W-What, I told you to kill them...! It should be easy for you to kill them before I get killed...!"[lr]::
42097::$$$message_0366_0041_0002$$$::"...No, unfortunately, we are out of time. It will rot if we let it be any longer."::
42098::$$$message_0366_0042_0000$$$::The man shows Shinji, who is closing in on him, the thing in his right hand.[lr]::
42099::$$$message_0366_0042_0001$$$::...A red lump.[lr]::
42100::$$$message_0366_0042_0002$$$::It's the thing that he took out of the girl, it's still throbbing.::
42101::$$$message_0366_0043_0000$$$::"Khh..."[lr]::
42102::$$$message_0366_0043_0001$$$::Shinji grits his teeth in vexation.::
42103::$$$message_0366_0044_0000$$$::"...Damn, don't regret it, Tohsaka! I won't let you be on my side now...!"[lr]::
42104::$$$message_0366_0044_0001$$$::Shinji runs towards the front entrance.::
42105::$$$message_0366_0045_0000$$$::...There's one person left.[lr]::
42106::$$$message_0366_0045_0001$$$::After the man slowly watches his Master being angry...[lr]::
42107::$$$message_0366_0045_0002$$$::"So that is it. You have a good friend."[lr]::
42108::$$$message_0366_0045_0003$$$::He says delightfully and leaves the hall filled with rubble.::
