10552::$$$message_0107_0000_0000$$$::"No, I agree with Tohsaka. We shouldn't be going there yet."::
10553::$$$message_0107_0001_0000$$$::"What? Are you saying you will not fight either!?[lr]::
10554::$$$message_0107_0001_0001$$$::That is ridiculous. What was the point in me resting, then!?[lr]::
10555::$$$message_0107_0001_0002$$$::We must strike first...especially now that we know where our enemy is!"::
10556::$$$message_0107_0002_0000$$$::"I know that. But we need to wait, Saber.[lr]::
10557::$$$message_0107_0002_0001$$$::If the Master at Ryudou Temple is so thoroughly prepared, they'll have set a trap for us. Rushing in without a plan is suicide."[lr]::
10558::$$$message_0107_0002_0002$$$::Tohsaka's right. We should at least wait until Archer's recovered."::
10559::$$$message_0107_0003_0000$$$::"These are the risks we must always face. I do not expect victory without injury or setback.[lr]::
10560::$$$message_0107_0003_0001$$$::Even if the enemy's traps pierce my body, I can fight on so long as I have my head.[lr]::
10561::$$$message_0107_0003_0002$$$::No matter how badly injured I am, it is worth the risk if we can defeat its Master, is it not!?"::
10562::$$$message_0107_0004_0000$$$::"Wha...don't be such a fool! Who would ever say it's okay to get hurt!?[lr]::
10563::$$$message_0107_0004_0001$$$::It's fine going in knowing the risks. But a suicidal mission is stupid. As your Master, I can't let you do something so dangerous."::
10564::$$$message_0107_0005_0000$$$::Going over to Ryudou Temple would be suicide, no question.[lr]::
10565::$$$message_0107_0005_0001$$$::The lone road leading up to the temple is sure to be packed with traps or obstacles. Maybe both.[lr]::
10566::$$$message_0107_0005_0002$$$::It's one thing to go in expecting the dangers, but doing it without a plan to deal with them is suicidal.[lr]::
10567::$$$message_0107_0005_0003$$$::No matter how powerful Saber is, she's still held back by my weakness.[lr]::
10568::$$$message_0107_0005_0004$$$::I would hate for her to push herself to fight, and end up[line2]::
10569::$$$message_0107_0006_0000$$$::If it ends up like it did last time, I can't agree to just charge in blindly.::
10570::$$$message_0107_0007_0000$$$::"I did not think to hear you say such a thing again.[lr]::
10571::$$$message_0107_0007_0001$$$::Listen, Master. Servants are meant to get hurt.[lr]::
10572::$$$message_0107_0007_0002$$$::I will not allow my Master to avoid battle simply for fear of that eventuality."::
10573::$$$message_0107_0008_0000$$$::"Fine. It doesn't matter if you don't allow it. If you're going to keep being so reckless, I'll stop you as many times as I have to.[lr]::
10574::$$$message_0107_0008_0001$$$::If you don't like that, then hurry up and heal yourself. You're still not fully healed, are you?"::
10575::$$$message_0107_0009_0000$$$::"Not so much that it should interfere with my ability to fight. Delaying combat because you are concerned about a wound is pointless."[lr]::
10576::$$$message_0107_0009_0001$$$::Saber just won't change her mind about fighting.::
10577::$$$message_0107_0010_0000$$$::"...Gh."[lr]::
10578::$$$message_0107_0010_0001$$$::Argh! Why doesn't she understand, no matter what I say!?::
10579::$$$message_0107_0011_0000$$$::"Yeah? Well, I'm not budging.[lr]::
10580::$$$message_0107_0011_0001$$$::You lost to Berserker before! Are you going to push through and keep on fighting so we can both be defeated again!?[lr]::
10581::$$$message_0107_0011_0002$$$::You've gotta be kidding me! I don't want to get killed all over again..."::
10582::$$$message_0107_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
10583::$$$message_0107_0012_0001$$$::And then...[lr]::
10584::$$$message_0107_0012_0002$$$::I expect Saber to argue. Instead, she just draws in a breath and...[lr]::
10585::$$$message_0107_0012_0003$$$::"That was cruel, Shirou."[lr]::
10586::$$$message_0107_0012_0004$$$::Her tone is apologetic.::
10587::$$$message_0107_0013_0000$$$::"I'm sorry to be unfair.[lr]::
10588::$$$message_0107_0013_0001$$$::But I'm still not willing to attack yet.[lr]::
10589::$$$message_0107_0013_0002$$$::I know I can't let the Master at Ryudou Temple do as they please. But we're in no condition to fight. If we rush in now and are defeated, then who will stop the Master at Ryudou Temple?"::
10590::$$$message_0107_0014_0000$$$::"Listen. We're going to attack, but only [font italic=true]after[font italic=false] your wound is healed and we're in peak condition. If you have a problem with that, go find another Master."::
10591::$$$message_0107_0015_0000$$$::"...Understood. If Master insists."[lr]::
10592::$$$message_0107_0015_0001$$$::Saber's voice is quiet as she answers, and then she falls silent.::
10593::$$$message_0107_0016_0000$$$::Our conversation ends there.[lr]::
10594::$$$message_0107_0016_0001$$$::Tohsaka and Saber both go back to their rooms.::
10595::$$$message_0107_0017_0000$$$::I'm left alone in the living room, and find myself starting to regret what I did.[lr]::
10596::$$$message_0107_0017_0001$$$::Well, it's too late.[lr]::
10597::$$$message_0107_0017_0002$$$::I could've said it differently...so why did I have to say it the way I did?[lr]::
10598::$$$message_0107_0017_0003$$$::Why was I only able to convince her with words that cut her so deep?:Kºõ
