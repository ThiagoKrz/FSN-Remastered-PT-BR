75585::$$$message_0696_0000_0000$$$::We run through the forest.[lr]::
75586::$$$message_0696_0000_0001$$$::I'm following Tohsaka's back.[lr]::
75587::$$$message_0696_0000_0002$$$::I can sense Assassin chasing us through the trees.::
75588::$$$message_0696_0001_0000$$$::"Behind you, Emiya!"[lr]::
75589::$$$message_0696_0001_0001$$$::Tohsaka should have gotten far ahead of us by now, but she slows down and turns back. She must be worried.::
75590::$$$message_0696_0002_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
75591::$$$message_0696_0002_0001$$$::I know the enemy is right behind me.[lr]::
75592::$$$message_0696_0002_0002$$$::But I can't do anything about it.[lr]::
75593::$$$message_0696_0002_0003$$$::My pursuer is Assassin.[lr]::
75594::$$$message_0696_0002_0004$$$::How am I supposed to shake him off with Illya in tow?::
75595::$$$message_0696_0003_0000$$$::"That's far enough. I don't need you."::
75596::$$$message_0696_0004_0000$$$::"Eh...?"[lr]::
75597::$$$message_0696_0004_0001$$$::A sinister voice growls in my ear.[lr]::
75598::$$$message_0696_0004_0002$$$::I look to the side and see a face in a skull mask,[lr]::
75599::$$$message_0696_0004_0003$$$::smirking and licking a dagger.::
75600::$$$message_0696_0005_0000$$$::"Rragh!"[lr]::
75601::$$$message_0696_0005_0001$$$::The white skull is blown away.[lr]::
75602::$$$message_0696_0005_0002$$$::Assassin was running next to us, until someone kicked him in the stomach.::
75603::$$$message_0696_0006_0000$$$::"...Hmph. So you can't even kill a child without resorting to an ambush? You third-rate."[lr]::
75604::$$$message_0696_0006_0001$$$::Archer doesn't stop as he says it.::
75605::$$$message_0696_0007_0000$$$::"I'll cover the rear guard. Take Illya and run.[lr]::
75606::$$$message_0696_0007_0001$$$::Hurry. If that thing catches up to you, you're finished."[lr]::
75607::$$$message_0696_0007_0002$$$::Archer's looking at Assassin and something else approaching from behind him.::
75608::$$$message_0696_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75609::$$$message_0696_0008_0001$$$::...It's catching up.[lr]::
75610::$$$message_0696_0008_0002$$$::The Shadow is corroding the ground itself as it catches up to us...!::
75611::$$$message_0696_0009_0000$$$::"Archer...!?"[lr]::
75612::$$$message_0696_0009_0001$$$::"Save the discussion for later. Run, boy. Now that you've taken Illya's hand, protect her til the very end."::
75613::$$$message_0696_0010_0000$$$::Archer slightly slows and falls behind us.[lr]::
75614::$$$message_0696_0010_0001$$$::For an instant...[lr]::
75615::$$$message_0696_0010_0002$$$::Just before he leaves, he looks at Illya with a terribly sorry expression.::
75616::$$$message_0696_0011_0000$$$::We leave the melee behind and escape the forest.[lr]::
75617::$$$message_0696_0011_0001$$$::The clash behind us continues between Assassin, our pursuer, and Archer, there to head him off.::
75618::$$$message_0696_0012_0000$$$::"Nngh..."[lr]::
75619::$$$message_0696_0012_0001$$$::Assassin is forced back repeatedly, unable to go on the offensive.[lr]::
75620::$$$message_0696_0012_0002$$$::He clashes evenly with Archer.[lr]::
75621::$$$message_0696_0012_0003$$$::Each dagger Assassin throws at me whenever he spots an opening is shot down, leaving him clearly frustrated.[lr]::
75622::$$$message_0696_0012_0004$$$::But, that isn't because he's weak.::
75623::$$$message_0696_0013_0000$$$::"Hah, sei!"[lr]::
75624::$$$message_0696_0013_0001$$$::Archer intercepts dozens of thrown daggers.[lr]::
75625::$$$message_0696_0013_0002$$$::He does it with vigor unlike anything he's shown thus far.[lr]::
75626::$$$message_0696_0013_0003$$$::    Archer has the advantage.[lr]::
75627::$$$message_0696_0013_0004$$$::I don't know why, but right now, he's fighting with demonic frenzy.::
75628::$$$message_0696_0014_0000$$$::"Ngh... How can you move!?"[lr]::
75629::$$$message_0696_0014_0001$$$::Assassin desperately parries a shot, retreating.[lr]::
75630::$$$message_0696_0014_0002$$$::Archer retorts.::
75631::$$$message_0696_0015_0000$$$::"It's simple. I'm not a proper hero like the others. I'm on the same level as that mud.[lr]::
75632::$$$message_0696_0015_0001$$$::In other words..."[lr]::
75633::$$$message_0696_0015_0002$$$::Archer steps back, perhaps sensing an opportunity...::
75634::$$$message_0696_0015_0003$$$::"I'm also a twisted Heroic Spirit, though not as bad as you...!"[lr]::
75635::$$$message_0696_0015_0004$$$::...and brings a sword down on the white mask.::
75636::$$$message_0696_0016_0000$$$::"Geeeeeee!!!"[lr]::
75637::$$$message_0696_0016_0001$$$::The black robe scrambles wildly.[lr]::
75638::$$$message_0696_0016_0002$$$::Assassin flees, clutching his slashed face.::
75639::$$$message_0696_0017_0000$$$::It isn't a temporary withdrawal, but a flight for his life.[lr]::
75640::$$$message_0696_0017_0001$$$::The black-robed Servant escapes Archer and disappears into the wooded gloom.::
75641::$$$message_0696_0018_0000$$$::"Nice one! Now we don't need to worry about him chasing us!"::
75642::$$$message_0696_0019_0000$$$::"Good work, Archer. You must be tired, so go ahead and rest in spirit form."::
75643::$$$message_0696_0020_0000$$$::Tohsaka congratulates him with palpable relief.[lr]::
75644::$$$message_0696_0020_0001$$$::"RIN!"[lr]::
75645::$$$message_0696_0020_0002$$$::Behind her.[lr]::
75646::$$$message_0696_0020_0003$$$::"Toh[line2]"[lr]::
75647::$$$message_0696_0020_0004$$$::It boils up, as if it was born in the shade of the trees.::
75648::$$$message_0696_0021_0000$$$::"Huh? What?"[lr]::
75649::$$$message_0696_0021_0001$$$::She turns around.[lr]::
75650::$$$message_0696_0021_0002$$$::Simultaneously, the Shadow's black tentacles reach out...::
75651::$$$message_0696_0022_0000$$$::"Toh...saka..."[lr]::
75652::$$$message_0696_0022_0001$$$::I won't make it in time.[lr]::
75653::$$$message_0696_0022_0002$$$::I can only watch as the tentacles lance forth to impale Tohsaka...::
75654::$$$message_0696_0023_0000$$$::"Guh..."[lr]::
75655::$$$message_0696_0023_0001$$$::...but skewer Archer instead, after he pushes her out of the way.::
75656::$$$message_0696_0024_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
75657::$$$message_0696_0024_0001$$$::Tohsaka stares up in shock at Archer.::
75658::$$$message_0696_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75659::$$$message_0696_0025_0001$$$::Archer's done.[lr]::
75660::$$$message_0696_0025_0002$$$::He's still breathing, and there isn't much blood.[lr]::
75661::$$$message_0696_0025_0003$$$::He's been impaled, but if it isn't through a vital spot, he should be able to regenerate from it.[lr]::
75662::$$$message_0696_0025_0004$$$::Still, I know that he can't fight anymore.::
75663::$$$message_0696_0026_0000$$$::That thing kills Servants.[lr]::
75664::$$$message_0696_0026_0001$$$::No matter how powerful a Heroic Spirit is, it can't beat the Shadow because it's a summoned Servant.[lr]::
75665::$$$message_0696_0026_0002$$$::I just know that, somehow.::
75666::$$$message_0696_0027_0000$$$::"No way... Archer...what are you doing?"[lr]::
75667::$$$message_0696_0027_0001$$$::Does Tohsaka sense it too?[lr]::
75668::$$$message_0696_0027_0002$$$::She calls out to Archer in a trembling voice, climbing to her unsteady feet, but...[lr]::
75669::$$$message_0696_0027_0003$$$::"Stay away! Get out of here, you fool!"[lr]::
75670::$$$message_0696_0027_0004$$$::Archer's harsh rebuke stops her in her tracks.::
75671::$$$message_0696_0028_0000$$$::   The Shadow pulsates.[lr]::
75672::$$$message_0696_0028_0001$$$::This forest will die.[lr]::
75673::$$$message_0696_0028_0002$$$::All of the surrounding mana is being sucked into the Shadow.::
75674::$$$message_0696_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75675::$$$message_0696_0029_0001$$$::Stupidly, I think that it reminds me of a water balloon.[lr]::
75676::$$$message_0696_0029_0002$$$::The balloon is engorged and still filling.[lr]::
75677::$$$message_0696_0029_0003$$$::An unsavory premonition of it bursting and exploding its contents all over us flashes through my mind.::
75678::$$$message_0696_0030_0000$$$::"Oh...crap."[lr]::
75679::$$$message_0696_0030_0001$$$::We're going to be caught in it.[lr]::
75680::$$$message_0696_0030_0002$$$::We'll be completely swallowed by it here.[lr]::
75681::$$$message_0696_0030_0003$$$::...Archer pulls out the tentacles skewering his body, and runs at Tohsaka.[lr]::
75682::$$$message_0696_0030_0004$$$::Then, I'll...[lr]::
