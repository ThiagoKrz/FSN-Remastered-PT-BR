22187::$$$message_0199_0000_0000$$$::   Then...[lr]::
22188::$$$message_0199_0000_0001$$$::The next thing I know, it's morning.::
22189::$$$message_0199_0001_0000$$$::"Pathetic. I couldn't sleep a wink."[lr]::
22190::$$$message_0199_0001_0001$$$::I sigh and turn off the ringing alarm clock.[lr]::
22191::$$$message_0199_0001_0002$$$::Today, no matter what she says, Saber and I are going on a date.[lr]::
22192::$$$message_0199_0001_0003$$$::My first priority will be to take her to plenty of places, so she'll have a chance to enjoy herself.[lr]::
22193::$$$message_0199_0001_0004$$$::I've been trying to search my mind for the perfect spot for a date, but before I could come up with anything, my alarm went off.::
22194::$$$message_0199_0002_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
22195::$$$message_0199_0002_0001$$$::I'd turned the alarm clock on just in case.[lr]::
22196::$$$message_0199_0002_0002$$$::As hard as I tried, I still couldn't think of anything last night, so I borrowed an alarm clock from Tohsaka, figuring I might have to pull an all-nighter.[lr]::
22197::$$$message_0199_0002_0003$$$::Not that it's done any good.::
22198::$$$message_0199_0003_0000$$$::"Come to think of it, I've never been on a date."[lr]::
22199::$$$message_0199_0003_0001$$$::I sigh again.[lr]::
22200::$$$message_0199_0003_0002$$$::That's sort of a problem.[lr]::
22201::$$$message_0199_0003_0003$$$::I'm nervous enough, plus I didn't sleep, but I think the worst part is how shocked I am that, after staying up all night to think about it, I couldn't come up with a single thing a girl might like.::
22202::$$$message_0199_0004_0000$$$::"Fine. I'm going to leave it all to chance. I'm just going to take her all over the place and she'll learn what it's like to have a good time."::
22203::$$$message_0199_0005_0000$$$::I'll just take her to cute shops.[lr]::
22204::$$$message_0199_0005_0001$$$::Well, I feel like there's a fundamental flaw in that plan, but I've already made up my mind.[lr]::
22205::$$$message_0199_0005_0002$$$::There's nothing else I can think of, but what this all boils down to is that today is going to be a day packed with fun, and it'll go on until Saber says she's had enough.::
22206::$$$message_0199_0006_0000$$$::"So Illyasviel has not yet awoken?"::
22207::$$$message_0199_0007_0000$$$::"No. She's still asleep. It doesn't look like she's going to wake up anytime soon, so you two got lucky there.[lr]::
22208::$$$message_0199_0007_0001$$$::If Illya were awake, she would've followed Shirou around and gotten in your way.::
22209::$$$message_0199_0008_0000$$$::"Yes. We cannot have her accompany Shirou like she has been doing.[lr]::
22210::$$$message_0199_0008_0001$$$::Things may have taken an unexpected turn last night, but today we shall go and search for the remaining Masters. Shirou does not have time to be taking care of Illyasviel."::
22211::$$$message_0199_0009_0000$$$::"Uh, well I wasn't talking about her getting in the way like that...but oh well.[lr]::
22212::$$$message_0199_0009_0001$$$::It's not my place to tell you exactly what you're doing. This is you and Shirou's problem."[lr]::
22213::$$$message_0199_0009_0002$$$::Tohsaka laughs mischievously.::
22214::$$$message_0199_0010_0000$$$::"Huh? A problem between Shirou and I?"[lr]::
22215::$$$message_0199_0010_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
22216::$$$message_0199_0011_0000$$$::We finish breakfast, and it seems like a good time to leave.[lr]::
22217::$$$message_0199_0011_0001$$$::Saber is ready to look for Masters, but I'm determined to execute my plan as well.[lr]::
22218::$$$message_0199_0011_0002$$$::I just need to be a man and tell her.::
22219::$$$message_0199_0012_0000$$$::"About that, Saber...[lr]::
22220::$$$message_0199_0012_0001$$$::We're going to go to the neighboring town today. If you have to get ready, I want you to do it now."::
22221::$$$message_0199_0013_0000$$$::"Are we going to go search for Masters? I would suggest we go to the suburbs instead of the neighboring town."[lr]::
22222::$$$message_0199_0013_0001$$$::"That's not what we're doing. The two of us are gong to go out and have fun today, so there's no point in us going to the suburbs."::
22223::$$$message_0199_0014_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
22224::$$$message_0199_0014_0001$$$::Saber freezes.[lr]::
22225::$$$message_0199_0014_0002$$$::I try to ignore the sound of Tohsaka trying, and largely failing, to control her laughter behind me. I will get her for that...later.::
22226::$$$message_0199_0015_0000$$$::"Um, Shirou...I do not understand. It is not you and Rin going out to have fun, but..."[lr]::
22227::$$$message_0199_0015_0001$$$::"If I'm going, you're the only one who could come with me, Saber. Tohsaka is going to stay back and watch Illya, so she has nothing to do with this."::
22228::$$$message_0199_0016_0000$$$::"This is ridiculous. You and I going to the next town to investigate will yield nothing. There is no point to this. What are you trying to accomplish here?"::
22229::$$$message_0199_0017_0000$$$::Saber's pretty clearly frustrated.[lr]::
22230::$$$message_0199_0017_0001$$$::I kind of figured something like this would happen, but things are looking even bleaker than I thought since she clearly thinks we're going out to town to search for Masters.::
22231::$$$message_0199_0018_0000$$$::"This is rough... I'm being really clear, but you still don't get it, Saber. I'm trying to ask you on a date."::
22232::$$$message_0199_0019_0000$$$::I ignore Tohsaka's stare as I speak to Saber.[lr]::
22233::$$$message_0199_0019_0001$$$::I'm not sure how much Saber understands.[lr]::
22234::$$$message_0199_0019_0002$$$::"I do not understand what you mean. Can you clarify, Shirou?"[lr]::
22235::$$$message_0199_0019_0003$$$::She looks even more irritated.::
22236::$$$message_0199_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22237::$$$message_0199_0020_0001$$$::And suddenly, it's like a switch flips in my head.[lr]::
22238::$$$message_0199_0020_0002$$$::There's no sense beating around the bush here.[lr]::
22239::$$$message_0199_0020_0003$$$::It'd be best if I were just blunt with her.::
22240::$$$message_0199_0021_0000$$$::"Shirou. If you tell me to go to town, then I will obey. However I would appreciate it if you explain what the purpose of this 'date' is.[lr]::
22241::$$$message_0199_0021_0001$$$::No matter how familiar I am with this age, there are terms I still do not know. Please do not use technical terms without explaining them."[lr]::
22242::$$$message_0199_0022_0000$$$::"It's not really a technical term.[lr]::
22243::$$$message_0199_0022_0001$$$::I can teach you if you don't know, but a date is when someone goes out and has fun with a girl."[lr]::
22244::$$$message_0199_0022_0002$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
22245::$$$message_0199_0022_0003$$$::Saber goes completely still.::
22246::$$$message_0199_0023_0000$$$::"A girl... Do you mean...me?"[lr]::
22247::$$$message_0199_0023_0001$$$::She's dazed now, muttering.[lr]::
22248::$$$message_0199_0023_0002$$$::When I nod yes, Saber looks even more confused.::
22249::$$$message_0199_0024_0000$$$::"I understand the meaning of the word now, but I still do not understand your intentions. For what reason would you do such a thing?"::
22250::$$$message_0199_0025_0000$$$::"...Hm."[lr]::
22251::$$$message_0199_0025_0001$$$::I wasn't expecting this question.[lr]::
22252::$$$message_0199_0025_0002$$$::I mean, I know what the point of a date is, but now that I'm on the spot and Saber wants me to explain it to her face, well...::
22253::$$$message_0199_0026_0000$$$::"Argh! She's confused because you're using an unusual term. Drop 'date' and just use a term that's easier to understand."::
22254::$$$message_0199_0027_0000$$$::"Listen, Saber. A date basically means a tryst.[lr]::
22255::$$$message_0199_0027_0001$$$::Shirou may be talking about going out and having fun, but what he's [font italic=true]really[font italic=false] getting at here is the whole 'boy trying to attract the attention of a girl he likes' thing."::
22256::$$$message_0199_0028_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
22257::$$$message_0199_0028_0001$$$::I cough, loud.[lr]::
22258::$$$message_0199_0028_0002$$$::Tohsaka may be right, but I am pretty confident that a date and a tryst are two very different things.::
22259::$$$message_0199_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22260::$$$message_0199_0029_0001$$$::But I don't think it's worth mentioning.[lr]::
22261::$$$message_0199_0029_0002$$$::From her reaction, it looks like Saber finally understands what a date is.::
22262::$$$message_0199_0030_0000$$$::"Exactly, Saber.[lr]::
22263::$$$message_0199_0030_0001$$$::We're going to head to town and we're not going to fight. We can't fight during the day anyway because there are people around. So there should be no problem with us spending the day however we want."::
22264::$$$message_0199_0031_0000$$$::"That may be true, but this seems pointless. I can see nothing that you will gain from doing such a thing."::
22265::$$$message_0199_0032_0000$$$::"That's not entirely true. And I wouldn't mind if it were.[lr]::
22266::$$$message_0199_0032_0001$$$::I've decided to spend the day with you, Saber, so don't worry about me.[lr]::
22267::$$$message_0199_0032_0002$$$::We're going to go out to town, and that's that. Nothing you say will change my mind, Saber."[lr]::
22268::$$$message_0199_0032_0003$$$::I look her straight in the eye.::
22269::$$$message_0199_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22270::$$$message_0199_0033_0001$$$::Saber ponders for a while, looking serious.[lr]::
22271::$$$message_0199_0033_0002$$$::"Then even if I refuse, will you be heading out to town on your own?"::
22272::$$$message_0199_0034_0000$$$::"Yep, I'm definitely going. Or everything I spent all night thinking about will have been a waste."[lr]::
22273::$$$message_0199_0034_0001$$$::"...Then I cannot allow you to go unaccompanied. I am your Servant, and so cannot leave my Master to go alone."::
22274::$$$message_0199_0035_0000$$$::After taking a deep breath...[lr]::
22275::$$$message_0199_0035_0001$$$::Saber answers in her usual manner.::
22276::$$$message_0199_0036_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22277::$$$message_0199_0036_0001$$$::Okay, that could have gone better, but at least I've managed to convince her to come out.[lr]::
22278::$$$message_0199_0036_0002$$$::I shouldn't sweat the small stuff at this point.::
22279::$$$message_0199_0037_0000$$$::"Have fun! Bring back something nice!"[lr]::
22280::$$$message_0199_0037_0001$$$::As we step outside, I make a rude gesture at Tohsaka, since she made fun of me until the very end.::
22281::$$$message_0199_0038_0000$$$::"So...[lr]::
22282::$$$message_0199_0038_0001$$$::What, specifically, are we going to do, Shirou?"[lr]::
22283::$$$message_0199_0038_0002$$$::"Well, let's just head to the neighboring town. We'll catch the bus at the intersection."::
22284::$$$message_0199_0039_0000$$$::The hilly path is unusually quiet.[lr]::
22285::$$$message_0199_0039_0001$$$::It's a little past nine in the morning on a weekday, and the town is starting to come alive, but it must be a little early to be heading out somewhere.[lr]::
22286::$$$message_0199_0039_0002$$$::There's no one on the road; it's like we have the road to ourselves.::
22287::$$$message_0199_0040_0000$$$::"Now that I think about it, I don't feel guilty about skipping school anymore. I've been cooped up in the house these past few days."::
22288::$$$message_0199_0041_0000$$$::"Of course. You are a Master, so you should not be walking around so casually."::
22289::$$$message_0199_0042_0000$$$::Saber's tone is sharp.[lr]::
22290::$$$message_0199_0042_0001$$$::Saber following behind me is nothing new, but it feels different today.[lr]::
22291::$$$message_0199_0042_0002$$$::I feel this immense pressure directed at me, and that's putting it [font italic=true]mildly[font italic=false].[lr]::
22292::$$$message_0199_0042_0003$$$::I can tell Saber's going to be tough to handle.::
22293::$$$message_0199_0043_0000$$$::We get on the bus.[lr]::
22294::$$$message_0199_0043_0001$$$::It would have been stuffed with people about an hour ago, but there's only a handful of people using it now.[lr]::
22295::$$$message_0199_0043_0002$$$::The only people on the bus are old women with children, so it feels like we have the place to ourselves.::
22296::$$$message_0199_0044_0000$$$::"Saber, let's sit at the very back."[lr]::
22297::$$$message_0199_0044_0001$$$::I call out to Saber, who for some reason tries to sit at the front of the bus, and lead her to the wider seat at the back.::
22298::$$$message_0199_0045_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
22299::$$$message_0199_0045_0001$$$::Saber quietly looks out over the passing scenery.::
22300::$$$message_0199_0046_0000$$$::I steal a glance at her, and realize how crazy I am for what I'm trying to do today.[lr]::
22301::$$$message_0199_0046_0001$$$::Taking the bus to a nearby town is an ordinary thing for me.[lr]::
22302::$$$message_0199_0046_0002$$$::But here, in this ordinary place, something extraordinary is happening.::
22303::$$$message_0199_0047_0000$$$::Or...[lr]::
22304::$$$message_0199_0047_0001$$$::Well, I'm finding myself questioning whether I'm actually doing this whole date thing, and my mind starts spinning and whirling like some complex cube puzzle.::
22305::$$$message_0199_0048_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22306::$$$message_0199_0048_0001$$$::   Ahhh.[lr]::
22307::$$$message_0199_0048_0002$$$::Crap. I'm getting really nervous. It's...kind of getting out of control.::
22308::$$$message_0199_0049_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22309::$$$message_0199_0049_0001$$$::I take a deep breath to calm myself down so Saber won't notice.[lr]::
22310::$$$message_0199_0049_0002$$$::But then...and I know this is stupid...I take another look at Saber.::
22311::$$$message_0199_0050_0000$$$::"...Gh."[lr]::
22312::$$$message_0199_0050_0001$$$::My heart skips a beat.[lr]::
22313::$$$message_0199_0050_0002$$$::I hardly recognize Saber as she sits next to me. Or...well, it's less that I don't recognize her than it is that the situation itself is unrecognizable.[lr]::
22314::$$$message_0199_0050_0003$$$::It makes me realize that she is something else... She is different.::
22315::$$$message_0199_0051_0000$$$::I didn't realize it when we were at home.[lr]::
22316::$$$message_0199_0051_0001$$$::This ordinary, everyday life seems to me like it's become something entirely new and different just because Saber is here.::
22317::$$$message_0199_0052_0000$$$::Her golden blonde hair...her green eyes... Those alone are enough to make her overwhelmingly beautiful.[lr]::
22318::$$$message_0199_0052_0001$$$::It hadn't really crossed my mind, since I never had much to compare her to.::
22319::$$$message_0199_0053_0000$$$::I remember the first time I met Saber.[lr]::
22320::$$$message_0199_0053_0001$$$::I must have been avoiding her because I was too embarrassed to admit that I was admiring Saber.[lr]::
22321::$$$message_0199_0053_0002$$$::No matter what Saber says, to me, she's a girl before she's a swordsman.[lr]::
22322::$$$message_0199_0053_0003$$$::I didn't know how to react to her, and I didn't understand my feelings for her.::
22323::$$$message_0199_0054_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
22324::$$$message_0199_0054_0001$$$::I have to admit, I know I sound stupid.[lr]::
22325::$$$message_0199_0054_0002$$$::I've developed trust and affection for Saber, past the point of no return. And now I've decided to go on a date with her.[lr]::
22326::$$$message_0199_0054_0003$$$::The order of events is all backward. Now, as I get off the buss, I finally realize what a big deal it is to go on a date with the girl I like.::
22327::$$$message_0199_0055_0000$$$::But that's okay.[lr]::
22328::$$$message_0199_0055_0001$$$::I can only give it my all, so I can't very well take it all back and cower in fear now.::
22329::$$$message_0199_0056_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22330::$$$message_0199_0056_0001$$$::I calm myself and try to shake off my ridiculous apprehension.[lr]::
22331::$$$message_0199_0056_0002$$$::The bus crosses the bridge and drives towards the development area and its masses of tall buildings.[lr]::
22332::$$$message_0199_0056_0003$$$::I breathe out, almost whistling, and ready myself.[lr]::
22333::$$$message_0199_0056_0004$$$::The familiar bus announcement tells us that we've arrived at Shinto Station.::
