49500::$$$message_0426_0000_0002$$$::This is a shock! I didn't think there was a soldier watching this Tiger Dojo![lr]::
49501::$$$message_0426_0000_0003$$$::Ahhh, Shirou. How pathetic of you to die!::
49502::$$$message_0426_0000_0004$$$::I have no advice to give![lr]::
49503::$$$message_0426_0000_0005$$$::Quickly go back to the other choice and settle the match once and for all!::

49510::$$$message_0426_0000_0012$$$::Senpai, how exactly can players get to the good end?::
49511::$$$message_0426_0000_0013$$$::Bring her back on the third night.[lr]::
49512::$$$message_0426_0000_0014$$$::See how she's doing on the morning of the fifth.[lr]::
49513::$$$message_0426_0000_0015$$$::Make her happy after school on the eighth day.::
49514::$$$message_0426_0000_0016$$$::Talk to her at the dojo on the tenth night.[lr]::

49518::$$$message_0426_0000_0020$$$::Nope. You only have to do four of them.[lr]::
49519::$$$message_0426_0000_0021$$$::Out of which, two are unnecessary.[lr]::
49520::$$$message_0426_0000_0022$$$::You won't be able to get past the twelfth day if you're too preoccupied with Saber.::

49522::$$$message_0426_0000_0024$$$::So there you have it. If you have the time, go ahead and go back all the way from the third day!::
