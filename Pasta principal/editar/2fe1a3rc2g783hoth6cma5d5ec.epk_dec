69142::$$$message_0636_0001_0000$$$::"...Rider. I'll fight until the very end. I want to save Sakura, just like you want to protect her. I don't know how it'll turn out, but I can't run from this.[lr]::
69143::$$$message_0636_0001_0001$$$::...I'll fight to bring Sakura back. If you're going to stop me, then I'll do everything I can to eliminate you."[lr]::
