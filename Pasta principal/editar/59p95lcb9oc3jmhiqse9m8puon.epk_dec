24274::$$$message_0212_0000_0000$$$::   I can't leave Saber alone.[lr]::
24275::$$$message_0212_0000_0001$$$::Rider's gone, and the book that acted as Shinji's Command Spell has burned to ash.[lr]::
24276::$$$message_0212_0000_0002$$$::Shinji doesn't have a Servant anymore, and he's lost his Command Spells.[lr]::
24277::$$$message_0212_0000_0003$$$::The contest is good as over.[lr]::
24278::$$$message_0212_0000_0004$$$::Saber is my priority now.::
24279::$$$message_0212_0001_0000$$$::"Saber...!"[lr]::
24280::$$$message_0212_0001_0001$$$::I rush to her.[lr]::
24281::$$$message_0212_0001_0002$$$::She's not holding the golden sword anymore.[lr]::
24282::$$$message_0212_0001_0003$$$::It's disappeared, and now there's just Saber, lying on the ground.::
24283::$$$message_0212_0002_0000$$$::"Eh...?"[lr]::
24284::$$$message_0212_0002_0001$$$::Saber is in bad shape.[lr]::
24285::$$$message_0212_0002_0002$$$::Beads of sweat trickle down her brow, and her breath is shallow, labored. She looks like she's got a fever.::
24286::$$$message_0212_0003_0000$$$::"No way... Hey, Saber! What's going on!?"[lr]::
24287::$$$message_0212_0003_0001$$$::I call out to Saber nervously, but she doesn't respond.[lr]::
24288::$$$message_0212_0003_0002$$$::...She's out cold.::
24289::$$$message_0212_0004_0000$$$::"Sa...ber...?"[lr]::
24290::$$$message_0212_0004_0001$$$::I touch her forehead.[lr]::
24291::$$$message_0212_0004_0002$$$::"It's hot!"[lr]::
24292::$$$message_0212_0004_0003$$$::I jerk my hand away.[lr]::
24293::$$$message_0212_0004_0004$$$::I-it's unnaturally hot![lr]::
24294::$$$message_0212_0004_0005$$$::She's got to be running a fever of over forty degrees!::
24295::$$$message_0212_0005_0000$$$::"Saber! Hey, pull yourself together!"[lr]::
24296::$$$message_0212_0005_0001$$$::I call out to her, but her only response is shallow, anguished breathing.[lr]::
24297::$$$message_0212_0005_0002$$$::"...Ngh!"[lr]::
24298::$$$message_0212_0005_0003$$$::I don't know what the hell's going on.[lr]::
24299::$$$message_0212_0005_0004$$$::I don't know what to do, but I can't just stand around.::
24300::$$$message_0212_0006_0000$$$::"I'm going to take you home! I'll deal with any complaints later!"[lr]::
24301::$$$message_0212_0006_0001$$$::I lift Saber up.[lr]::
24302::$$$message_0212_0006_0002$$$::She's so light.[lr]::
24303::$$$message_0212_0006_0003$$$::I knew that, of course...but now she seems even lighter.[lr]::
24304::$$$message_0212_0006_0004$$$::No, more than that, she's...::
24305::$$$message_0212_0007_0000$$$::"She's warm. That means she's still alive."[lr]::
24306::$$$message_0212_0007_0001$$$::Saber is still the person I've known all this time.[lr]::
24307::$$$message_0212_0007_0002$$$::I'm pissed with myself for even hesitating.[lr]::
24308::$$$message_0212_0007_0003$$$::Damn! What's it matter if she's a hero?[lr]::
24309::$$$message_0212_0007_0004$$$::No matter who Saber is, she's here, and she's still warm.[lr]::
24310::$$$message_0212_0007_0005$$$::How much of an idiot was I for putting up this wall between us before!?::
24311::$$$message_0212_0008_0000$$$::"We're going home quick. Just hold still, Saber!"[lr]::
24312::$$$message_0212_0008_0001$$$::I start running, Saber in my arms.[lr]::
24313::$$$message_0212_0008_0002$$$::There's no sense of triumph from this victory.[lr]::
24314::$$$message_0212_0008_0003$$$::All I feel is Saber in my arms, barely breathing.:σύ
