57224::$$$message_0504_0000_0000$$$::How's everyone doing?[lr]::
57225::$$$message_0504_0000_0001$$$::Welcome to the Tiger Dojo, where we save everyone who gets themselves dead in fruitless battles!::
57226::$$$message_0504_0000_0002$$$::...Wait, do you feel something shaking?::
57227::$$$message_0504_0000_0003$$$::We're here to take over the Tiger Dojo![lr]::
57228::$$$message_0504_0000_0004$$$::Surrender your weapons peacefully, Taiga!::
57229::$$$message_0504_0000_0005$$$::Is that former Disciple Number One...!?[lr]::
57230::$$$message_0504_0000_0006$$$::Whaddya think you're[line2]what the heeeeck!?::
57231::$$$message_0504_0000_0007$$$::Tiger![lr]::
57232::$$$message_0504_0000_0008$$$::Behold, Taiga[line2]our army's secret weapon!::
57233::$$$message_0504_0000_0009$$$::Weapons ready! Target: Tiger Dojo![lr]::
57234::$$$message_0504_0000_0010$$$::Gunner, fire![humming] ::
57235::$$$message_0504_0000_0011$$$::CHESTOOOOOO!!!::
57236::$$$message_0504_0000_0012$$$::...Huh?::
57237::$$$message_0504_0000_0013$$$::Kyaaaaah!?::
57238::$$$message_0504_0000_0014$$$::My Tiger, my precious Tiger left over from the Third Gerger Empire got blown up in one hit!?::
57239::$$$message_0504_0000_0015$$$::Yes! I'm surprised, too![lr]::
57240::$$$message_0504_0000_0016$$$::By the way, Private First Class Illya! I'm a little seriously surprised that you drove up in a tank!::
57241::$$$message_0504_0000_0017$$$::Ah. Tee-hee. I thought I'd give you a scare, Master, so I went all-out. Guess I'm a little prankster.::
57242::$$$message_0504_0000_0018$$$::I'll kill you!::
57243::$$$message_0504_0000_0019$$$::Osu! Thank you! (sobs)::
57244::$$$message_0504_0000_0020$$$::As long as you understand.::
57245::$$$message_0504_0000_0021$$$::I meant to drag this joke out a little longer, but it's becoming a pain, so I'm allowing you back into the school!::
57246::$$$message_0504_0000_0022$$$::Huh? Really, Master?::
57247::$$$message_0504_0000_0023$$$::Really really. We only have twelve episodes of Tiger Dojo left.[lr]::
57248::$$$message_0504_0000_0024$$$::I can't do this all alone.::
57249::$$$message_0504_0000_0025$$$::Plus, there was no telling what you'd try next time if I left you out in the cold.::
57250::$$$message_0504_0000_0026$$$::Yay! I scored a regular role![lr]::
57251::$$$message_0504_0000_0027$$$::Twelve episodes sounds like kind of a lot, though. Does Shirou get killed that many times?::
57252::$$$message_0504_0000_0028$$$::You bet he does.::
57253::$$$message_0504_0000_0029$$$::Shirou's mortality rate is the highest in this route, actually.[lr]::
57254::$$$message_0504_0000_0030$$$::And they're pretty gruesome deaths, too. Compared to when you splattered him, they're more like what you'd see in a horror film.::
57255::$$$message_0504_0000_0031$$$::Huh. I feel like the creator's personality is showing through.::
57256::$$$message_0504_0000_0032$$$::Yeah. So be careful with Shirou's decisions.[lr]::
57257::$$$message_0504_0000_0033$$$::This dead end happened...because you chose to fight alone, even though you don't have Saber anymore.::
57258::$$$message_0504_0000_0034$$$::Don't do that, Shirou. You're up against a bunch of monsters, so you need to team up with a monster to protect yourself.::
57259::$$$message_0504_0000_0035$$$::I know you don't want to, but you should go back and ask Rin for help.::
57260::$$$message_0504_0000_0036$$$::Watch yourself at the next choice, though. If you just do whatever people ask you to... I think a man ought to show more backbone.::
57261::$$$message_0504_0000_0037$$$::Exactly, Master! When you don't like something, say something![wsay canskip=1]::
57262::$$$message_0504_0000_0038$$$:: Shirou should be decisive!::
57263::$$$message_0504_0000_0039$$$::That's right.::
57264::$$$message_0504_0000_0040$$$::Well then, see you at the next Tiger Dojo![lr]::
57265::$$$message_0504_0000_0041$$$::There are four Tiger Dojos on Day 9, so make your choices carefully!::
57266::$$$message_0504_0000_0042$$$::See ya next time!::
