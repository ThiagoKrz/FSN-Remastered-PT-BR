2194::$$$message_0018_0000_0000$$$::    The day ends.[lr]::
2195::$$$message_0018_0000_0001$$$::I still feel uneasy with Saber sleeping so close by, so I escape to the shed.::
2196::$$$message_0018_0001_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
2197::$$$message_0018_0001_0001$$$::I stop and look up at the winter sky.[lr]::
2198::$$$message_0018_0001_0002$$$::...Not because the night sky is particularly beautiful.[lr]::
2199::$$$message_0018_0001_0003$$$::I'm just feeling the winter chill in a daze, doing nothing, because it calms me.::
2200::$$$message_0018_0002_0000$$$::I don't know how much time passed.[lr]::
2201::$$$message_0018_0002_0001$$$::I think I hear footsteps in the darkness.[lr]::
2202::$$$message_0018_0002_0002$$$::"...Who's there?"[lr]::
2203::$$$message_0018_0002_0003$$$::There's no answer.[lr]::
2204::$$$message_0018_0002_0004$$$::Footsteps approach, and I feel a piercing presence.::
2205::$$$message_0018_0003_0000$$$::...[lr]::
2206::$$$message_0018_0003_0001$$$::I crouch, ready to jump back at any time.[lr]::
2207::$$$message_0018_0003_0002$$$::"Hey. I asked who's there."[lr]::
2208::$$$message_0018_0003_0003$$$::There's no answer.[lr]::
2209::$$$message_0018_0003_0004$$$::The footsteps never stop, and the person finally appears before me.::
2210::$$$message_0018_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2211::$$$message_0018_0004_0001$$$::"You're..."[lr]::
2212::$$$message_0018_0004_0002$$$::It's the Servant who fought Lancer at school the other night.[lr]::
2213::$$$message_0018_0004_0003$$$::The red-armored knight Saber beat when she leaped over the wall...::
2214::$$$message_0018_0005_0000$$$::"Are you Tohsaka's Servant...Archer?"[lr]::
2215::$$$message_0018_0005_0001$$$::The man's lips curve upward.[lr]::
2216::$$$message_0018_0005_0002$$$::He smiled...can I take that as confirmation?::
2217::$$$message_0018_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2218::$$$message_0018_0006_0001$$$::Something about him annoys me.[lr]::
2219::$$$message_0018_0006_0002$$$::For no reason I can really understand, I find myself irritated. I can't make myself like this guy.[lr]::
2220::$$$message_0018_0006_0003$$$::I've never talked to him before, and he's never attacked me before.[lr]::
2221::$$$message_0018_0006_0004$$$::But I realize something the instant I see his face.::
2222::$$$message_0018_0007_0000$$$::...I can't respect this man.[lr]::
2223::$$$message_0018_0007_0001$$$::There's no reason for it that I can think of, but he and I aren't going to get along.[lr]::
2224::$$$message_0018_0007_0002$$$::I'm probably not the only one who feels like this. Archer probably feels he same way.[lr]::
2225::$$$message_0018_0007_0003$$$::There must be a total of three people in the world with whom I'm just completely incompatible.[lr]::
2226::$$$message_0018_0007_0004$$$::That's how bad it is. I wouldn't be surprised if he was irritable around me too.::
2227::$$$message_0018_0008_0000$$$::"What do you want? I thought you were going to stay on guard until your wounds healed up."[lr]::
2228::$$$message_0018_0008_0001$$$::"That is my intention. The moment my wounds heal, I'm putting an end to this ridiculous alliance you two formed. So, I've remained a spectator all this time since I believed there was nothing for me to say to you."[lr]::
2229::$$$message_0018_0008_0002$$$::"Don't let me stop you from spectating, then. There's nothing I want to talk to you about, either."::
2230::$$$message_0018_0009_0000$$$::"As much as I would like to do that, there's just one thing I cannot overlook.[lr]::
2231::$$$message_0018_0009_0001$$$::I hear you don't intend to let Saber fight."[lr]::
2232::$$$message_0018_0009_0002$$$::"What's wrong with that?"[lr]::
2233::$$$message_0018_0009_0003$$$::My reply is impulsive.::
2234::$$$message_0018_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2235::$$$message_0018_0010_0001$$$::He glares.[lr]::
2236::$$$message_0018_0010_0002$$$::With a fair amount of hostility, Archer makes it clear he sees right through me.::
2237::$$$message_0018_0011_0000$$$::"I knew it. Only a brat would do something like that.[lr]::
2238::$$$message_0018_0011_0001$$$::You won't accept help from anyone. You'll just do everything yourself.[lr]::
2239::$$$message_0018_0011_0002$$$::On top of it all, you don't want any casualties. That mentality disgusts me."::
2240::$$$message_0018_0012_0000$$$::"What!? You have no right to tell me that![lr]::
2241::$$$message_0018_0012_0001$$$::I'm only doing what I think is right! [font italic=true]You[font italic=false] have no reason to complain!"::
2242::$$$message_0018_0013_0000$$$::"I do, actually. As a fellow Servant, I understand Saber's hardship. Saber has a heavy weight to carry with a Master like you."::
2243::$$$message_0018_0014_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
2244::$$$message_0018_0014_0001$$$::He's not lying.[lr]::
2245::$$$message_0018_0014_0002$$$::But what really ticks me off is that I didn't want to hear this from [font italic=true]him[font italic=false] of all people.::
2246::$$$message_0018_0015_0000$$$::"Screw you! I'm not a burden to Saber! I'm going to fight in her place, so  there shouldn't be a problem!"::
2247::$$$message_0018_0016_0000$$$::"Hmph. Are you saying she won't get hurt as long as she doesn't fight? Servants only exist to fight. Forbidding her to fight is blasphemous...though I doubt there's any point telling you that."[lr]::
2248::$$$message_0018_0016_0001$$$::Having said what was on his mind, Archer falls silent.::
2249::$$$message_0018_0017_0000$$$::   A few minutes pass.[lr]::
2250::$$$message_0018_0017_0001$$$::The two of us just stare at each other.[lr]::
2251::$$$message_0018_0017_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2252::$$$message_0018_0017_0003$$$::I gulp.[lr]::
2253::$$$message_0018_0017_0004$$$::His cold stare seems to be trying to probe my insides.::
2254::$$$message_0018_0018_0000$$$::And then suddenly...[lr]::
2255::$$$message_0018_0018_0001$$$::"So, what's your plan, Master of Saber?"[lr]::
2256::$$$message_0018_0018_0002$$$::The red knight seems calm as he asks his question.::
2257::$$$message_0018_0019_0000$$$::"What do you mean?"[lr]::
2258::$$$message_0018_0019_0001$$$::"Do you really expect to end this war without fighting? Do you really think you'll never fight or kill anyone?"[lr]::
2259::$$$message_0018_0019_0002$$$::"I never said I won't fight. I'll fight if I need to fight."::
2260::$$$message_0018_0020_0000$$$::"I see. But you won't kill anyone when you fight?"[lr]::
2261::$$$message_0018_0020_0001$$$::"Yeah. Got a problem with that?"[lr]::
2262::$$$message_0018_0020_0002$$$::"I have no intention of butting into your moronic reasons for doing what you do. I don't have the time, and I'm just not crazy enough to try."[lr]::
2263::$$$message_0018_0020_0003$$$::Archer turns his back to me.::
2264::$$$message_0018_0021_0000$$$::"Don't get things confused, though. This champion of justice you're pretending to be? Nothing more than a cleaner. You should know that only the survivor is going to have a chance to save anyone that way."[lr]::
2265::$$$message_0018_0021_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2266::$$$message_0018_0021_0002$$$::I don't know why.[lr]::
2267::$$$message_0018_0021_0003$$$::But it felt like Archer was just beating up on me for no reason.::
2268::$$$message_0018_0022_0000$$$::"Wait. What do you mean a champion of justice is just a cleaner?"::
2269::$$$message_0018_0023_0000$$$::"You should have figured it out by now.[lr]::
2270::$$$message_0018_0023_0001$$$::Listen. Your approach won't undo a tragic death.[lr]::
2271::$$$message_0018_0023_0002$$$::That's the limitation you're working within.[lr]::
2272::$$$message_0018_0023_0003$$$::A champion of justice is someone who can only clean up a mess that's already been made. You'll never be able to save the very people you're hoping to save."::
2273::$$$message_0018_0024_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
2274::$$$message_0018_0024_0001$$$::That's...not true.[lr]::
2275::$$$message_0018_0024_0002$$$::The idea that you can't save the person you're reaching out to save is...wrong.::
2276::$$$message_0018_0025_0000$$$::"An ideal is just that: an ideal. As long as you hold to that ideal, the friction between it and reality will only get more intense. That's the path you're on right now.[lr]::
2277::$$$message_0018_0025_0001$$$::Someday you're going to face reality, and you'll have to pay the price. The choices you've made will cost many, many lives."::
2278::$$$message_0018_0026_0000$$$::"Wha...!"[lr]::
2279::$$$message_0018_0026_0001$$$::"You should at least be prepared. By the time you realize how narrow-minded you've been, you'll have to figure out how to fix it, and who to punish for it.[lr]::
2280::$$$message_0018_0026_0002$$$::If you can't do that, then I suggest you abandon both your dream and your magecraft right now."[lr]::
2281::$$$message_0018_0026_0003$$$::Archer disappears into the darkness.::
2282::$$$message_0018_0027_0000$$$::"Listen. No matter what anyone does, there will always be those who can't be saved. All your ideal will let you save is the ideal itself. There is so little a human can do.[lr]::
2283::$$$message_0018_0027_0001$$$::But even so..."::
2284::$$$message_0018_0028_0000$$$::"Hey wait! What the hell are you trying to say!?"[lr]::
2285::$$$message_0018_0028_0001$$$::My question is swallowed up in the darkness.[lr]::
2286::$$$message_0018_0028_0002$$$::Archer is already gone, and I'm just talking to empty air.::
2287::$$$message_0018_0029_0000$$$::"What the hell's with him? He just showed up, unloaded a bunch of crap on me, and disappeared!"[lr]::
2288::$$$message_0018_0029_0001$$$::He was telling me that my thinking is too idealistic, and I'm going to suffer for it soon.[lr]::
2289::$$$message_0018_0029_0002$$$::But how can I decide something is wrong before I've even tried it?::
2290::$$$message_0018_0030_0000$$$::"I'm ready. If I'm wrong, I'll just have to pay for that mistake with my life."[lr]::
2291::$$$message_0018_0030_0001$$$::That's my resolve as a mage.[lr]::
2292::$$$message_0018_0030_0002$$$::Archer doesn't have to remind me that.::
2293::$$$message_0018_0031_0000$$$::"Hmph. I really can't stand that guy."[lr]::
2294::$$$message_0018_0031_0001$$$::But...[lr]::
2295::$$$message_0018_0031_0002$$$::Something he said bothers me.::
2296::$$$message_0018_0032_0000$$$::[font italic=true]No matter what anyone does, there will always be those who can't be saved.[font italic=false][lr]::
2297::$$$message_0018_0032_0001$$$::[font italic=true]There is so little a human can do.[font italic=false][lr]::
2298::$$$message_0018_0032_0002$$$::[font italic=true]But even so...[font italic=false]::
2299::$$$message_0018_0033_0000$$$::"Even so...can I keep pursuing my ideal without ever looking back?"[lr]::
2300::$$$message_0018_0033_0001$$$::I mutter to myself.[lr]::
2301::$$$message_0018_0033_0002$$$::It felt like that's what Archer wanted to say.::
