24391::$$$message_0214_0000_0000$$$::Saber and I head out together, leaving Tohsaka at home.[lr]::
24392::$$$message_0214_0000_0001$$$::It's seven thirty in the morning.[lr]::
24393::$$$message_0214_0000_0002$$$::The hilly road is extremely quiet.[lr]::
24394::$$$message_0214_0000_0003$$$::The road is usually packed with students going to school, but there aren't that many people around today.::
24395::$$$message_0214_0001_0000$$$::"I heard the school will be closed for a while.[lr]::
24396::$$$message_0214_0001_0001$$$::There may not have been any deaths, but a majority of students are still bedbound."::
24397::$$$message_0214_0002_0000$$$::"Their symptoms are like severe malnutrition, so it should be a few days before they're up and around."::
24398::$$$message_0214_0003_0000$$$::But those are the lucky ones.[lr]::
24399::$$$message_0214_0003_0001$$$::There are still some whose injuries will last a lifetime.::
24400::$$$message_0214_0004_0000$$$::"...I hear Taiga was among those sent to the hospital. Do you need to go visit her, Shirou?"[lr]::
24401::$$$message_0214_0004_0001$$$::"Yeah, I hear Fuji-nee is just fatigued. I was told not to worry about her, and to just study at home."::
24402::$$$message_0214_0005_0000$$$::Before we left, I phoned the Fujimura house and asked how Fuji-nee was doing.[lr]::
24403::$$$message_0214_0005_0001$$$::I want to go visit, but I need to hold off for now.::
24404::$$$message_0214_0006_0000$$$::"So you are going to concentrate on investigating. That is fine, but do you have any leads?[lr]::
24405::$$$message_0214_0006_0001$$$::I can sense the presence of Servants, but only when they are nearby. Unless you have a lead of some kind, it will be difficult to locate them."::
24406::$$$message_0214_0007_0000$$$::"Yeah. It'd be hard if Shinji were just sitting around, doing nothing. But I know him, and I don't see him just keeping quiet after what happened yesterday."[lr]::
24407::$$$message_0214_0007_0001$$$::Shinji's not the type to just sit back and take a beating.::
24408::$$$message_0214_0008_0000$$$::"So you believe Rider's Master plans to create another Bounded Field...?"::
24409::$$$message_0214_0009_0000$$$::"No doubt about it. He's like me; he can't provide his Servant with magical energy. If Shinji wants to get revenge on me, he'll need a lot of magical energy.[lr]::
24410::$$$message_0214_0009_0001$$$::Which means it might not be so hard to find him."::
24411::$$$message_0214_0010_0000$$$::"So rather than looking for Rider's Master, we are going to look for a Bounded Field."[lr]::
24412::$$$message_0214_0010_0001$$$::"Yeah. We may not be able to detect the Master, but we should be able to detect a Bounded Field of that scale. And we'll be able to pinpoint the site too.[lr]::
24413::$$$message_0214_0010_0002$$$::We just need to find a big building that draws a large crowd."::
24414::$$$message_0214_0011_0000$$$::"This is a surprise. That is brilliant, Shirou." [lr]::
24415::$$$message_0214_0011_0001$$$::"I do have a brain, you know. If I wasn't confident about finding them, I wouldn't be saying this."::
24416::$$$message_0214_0012_0000$$$::...Yeah, I'm confident.[lr]::
24417::$$$message_0214_0012_0001$$$::The Bounded Field is one thing, but there's a point to us walking around like this too.[lr]::
24418::$$$message_0214_0012_0002$$$::Shinji probably can't leave me alone any more than I can leave him alone.::
24419::$$$message_0214_0013_0000$$$::I head to Shinji's house, just in case.[lr]::
24420::$$$message_0214_0013_0001$$$::I have Saber check for Rider's presence.[lr]::
24421::$$$message_0214_0013_0002$$$::She finds nothing.[lr]::
24422::$$$message_0214_0013_0003$$$::Well, Shinji's not the sort to just roll over and hide in his house after what's happened.::
24423::$$$message_0214_0014_0000$$$::"Let's go. If Shinji's going to create a Bounded Field, it wouldn't be here; it'll be in Shinto. Let's check all the office buildings there."[lr]::
24424::$$$message_0214_0014_0001$$$::I call Saber over and turn to leave the Matou house.::
24425::$$$message_0214_0015_0000$$$::"Shirou, this is Sakura's house, is it not?[lr]::
24426::$$$message_0214_0015_0001$$$::Since you are here, do you not at least intend to say hello? I believe we have time enough for that."::
24427::$$$message_0214_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
24428::$$$message_0214_0016_0001$$$::I am worried about Sakura.[lr]::
24429::$$$message_0214_0016_0002$$$::According to Tohsaka, Sakura was just weakened, and luckily wasn't injured beyond that.[lr]::
24430::$$$message_0214_0016_0003$$$::If it were up to me, I'd like to see her, and take care of her the way she's always taken care of me.[lr]::
24431::$$$message_0214_0016_0004$$$::But...::
24432::$$$message_0214_0017_0000$$$::"I won't do it. As long as the war is going, I shouldn't see her. I don't want to get her involved in any of this."::
24433::$$$message_0214_0018_0000$$$::Besides...[lr]::
24434::$$$message_0214_0018_0001$$$::I can't possibly face Sakura when I'm about to head out to fight her brother.[lr]::
24435::$$$message_0214_0018_0002$$$::Should the worst happen, and I actually kill Shinji, I'll never be able to face her again.::
24436::$$$message_0214_0019_0000$$$::I shouldn't leave any loose ends like that.[lr]::
24437::$$$message_0214_0019_0001$$$::It's best for me, and I'm sure it's best for Sakura too.::
24438::$$$message_0214_0020_0000$$$::We check every building we find.[lr]::
24439::$$$message_0214_0020_0001$$$::Of course, we start with the big ones, but so far...nothing.::
24440::$$$message_0214_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
24441::$$$message_0214_0021_0001$$$::I wipe the sweat from my brow and force my leaden limbs to keep moving.[lr]::
24442::$$$message_0214_0021_0002$$$::I try to calm my labored breathing by just taking a moment to rest.::
24443::$$$message_0214_0022_0000$$$::"Oh? Shirou, is there something the matt[line2]"::
24444::$$$message_0214_0023_0000$$$::"Shirou, this way."[lr]::
24445::$$$message_0214_0023_0001$$$::"Eh? Hold it. This is the park. There's still buildings we haven't looked[line2]"::
24446::$$$message_0214_0024_0000$$$::"Please let that matter wait a moment. This is more important."[lr]::
24447::$$$message_0214_0024_0001$$$::Something must have caught her attention.[lr]::
24448::$$$message_0214_0024_0002$$$::Saber's tone is stern and she pulls me towards the park.::
24449::$$$message_0214_0025_0000$$$::"H-hey Saber! What's going on? Why are we here? There's nothing here. Even you know that!"::
24450::$$$message_0214_0026_0000$$$::"Please, just sit on this bench. I will hear what you have to say once you have done so."::
24451::$$$message_0214_0027_0000$$$::"...Mh."[lr]::
24452::$$$message_0214_0027_0001$$$::Saber's...intense about this, so I reluctantly sit down.[lr]::
24453::$$$message_0214_0027_0002$$$::And then...[lr]::
24454::$$$message_0214_0027_0003$$$::...for a moment, I almost feel faint.::
24455::$$$message_0214_0028_0000$$$::"H...uh?"[lr]::
24456::$$$message_0214_0028_0001$$$::I hold my head with one hand.[lr]::
24457::$$$message_0214_0028_0002$$$::My forehead is damp with sweat, and my breathing is labored even though I'm sitting down.[lr]::
24458::$$$message_0214_0028_0003$$$::...Hey wait a minute.[lr]::
24459::$$$message_0214_0028_0004$$$::Why would I be sweating like this in the dead of winter?::
24460::$$$message_0214_0029_0000$$$::"This is weird. I don't know why I'm so exhausted."[lr]::
24461::$$$message_0214_0029_0001$$$::As soon as I say that, I realize what's going on.[lr]::
24462::$$$message_0214_0029_0002$$$::I'm not exhausted.[lr]::
24463::$$$message_0214_0029_0003$$$::My wounds haven't completely healed, so they're tingling.::
24464::$$$message_0214_0030_0000$$$::"...Ngh."[lr]::
24465::$$$message_0214_0030_0001$$$::This is unreal. No matter how much I try, I can't get my breathing under control.[lr]::
24466::$$$message_0214_0030_0002$$$::My body feels heavy, and my legs refuse to take my weight.::
24467::$$$message_0214_0031_0000$$$::"I see you have finally realized your condition, Shirou."[lr]::
24468::$$$message_0214_0031_0001$$$::Saber is mad.[lr]::
24469::$$$message_0214_0031_0002$$$::I don't blame her. I was the one who suggested searching for Shinji, but here I am, sitting on a bench.::
24470::$$$message_0214_0032_0000$$$::"Sorry. I'll get up soon. Just give me a moment."[lr]::
24471::$$$message_0214_0032_0001$$$::"That is not what I am trying to point out.[lr]::
24472::$$$message_0214_0032_0002$$$::Nothing seems to get through to you."::
24473::$$$message_0214_0033_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
24474::$$$message_0214_0033_0001$$$::I can see that Saber's mad.[lr]::
24475::$$$message_0214_0033_0002$$$::What I don't understand is why.::
24476::$$$message_0214_0034_0000$$$::"Hey Saber. You need to be clearer with me, or else I won't know what you're trying to get at."::
24477::$$$message_0214_0035_0000$$$::"If you do not know, there is no point telling you.[lr]::
24478::$$$message_0214_0035_0001$$$::Please just sit here, Shirou.[lr]::
24479::$$$message_0214_0035_0002$$$::If you will not rest on your own, then I shall join you."[lr]::
24480::$$$message_0214_0035_0003$$$::Saber sits right next to me.::
24481::$$$message_0214_0036_0000$$$::"Eh...?"[lr]::
24482::$$$message_0214_0036_0001$$$::The bench is not that big.[lr]::
24483::$$$message_0214_0036_0002$$$::Saber is sitting close enough to me that our shoulders might touch if one of us leans over even a little.::
24484::$$$message_0214_0037_0000$$$::"Hey...uh, wait, Saber![lr]::
24485::$$$message_0214_0037_0001$$$::We don't have time to rest. We didn't come here to play around[line2]"[lr]::
24486::$$$message_0214_0037_0002$$$::"We are indeed not here simply to loiter. Even in battle, you must rest. If you have a grievance, I suggest you air it after you've caught your breath."::
24487::$$$message_0214_0038_0000$$$::"Ugh...well you tell me to catch my breath, but..."[lr]::
24488::$$$message_0214_0038_0001$$$::Sure, I'm totally worn out, and I can barely breathe, but having her so close makes my heart go absolutely crazy, and...::
24489::$$$message_0214_0039_0000$$$::"Shirou. Are you listening to me? You have been pushing yourself this whole time. What you must do now is try to loosen up and calm down. You cannot rest properly if you continue on, distracted as you are."::
24490::$$$message_0214_0040_0000$$$::"Yeah, but..."[lr]::
24491::$$$message_0214_0040_0001$$$::If she wants me to be calm, it'd really help if she kept her distance...[lr]::
24492::$$$message_0214_0040_0002$$$::I don't know how Saber feels, but I can't help but see her as a girl around my own age.::
24493::$$$message_0214_0041_0000$$$::Well... she may actually be younger, but she's still a girl.[lr]::
24494::$$$message_0214_0041_0001$$$::...And plus, she's...beyond beautiful.[lr]::
24495::$$$message_0214_0041_0002$$$::No guy could stay calm this close to her, and I'm certainly no exception.::
24496::$$$message_0214_0042_0000$$$::"Shirou? Is it my imagination, or are you even paler than before?"[lr]::
24497::$$$message_0214_0042_0001$$$::"I...n-no! I-I'm not flustered or anything!"::
24498::$$$message_0214_0043_0000$$$::"If you say so...but perhaps you should lie down. Is there a place to lie down around here...?"::
24499::$$$message_0214_0044_0000$$$::Saber looks around.[lr]::
24500::$$$message_0214_0044_0001$$$::Oh, what the...[lr]::
24501::$$$message_0214_0044_0002$$$::What are the odds of there just being some random dude lying across a nearby bench using his girlfriend's lap as a pillow, in a park that's usually deserted?::
24502::$$$message_0214_0045_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
24503::$$$message_0214_0045_0001$$$::And...[lr]::
24504::$$$message_0214_0045_0002$$$::Saber glances at the pair of lovebirds. She's obviously thinking.::
24505::$$$message_0214_0046_0000$$$::"Shirou, if you do not feel well, then you should lie[line2]"[lr]::
24506::$$$message_0214_0046_0001$$$::"I'm fine! I just need to sit for a minute and I'll get better. Don't you worry about me! Nope, no worrying about me! Just leave me alone!"::
24507::$$$message_0214_0047_0000$$$::I turn away from Saber and close my eyes. Anything to keep our eyes from locking.[lr]::
24508::$$$message_0214_0047_0001$$$::...[lr]::
24509::$$$message_0214_0047_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Think calming thoughts, Shirou.[font italic=false][lr]::
24510::$$$message_0214_0047_0003$$$::Now I just have to keep taking deep breaths and try not to think about Saber being right next to me.::
24511::$$$message_0214_0048_0000$$$::   It took a night for the fire to die down.[lr]::
24512::$$$message_0214_0048_0001$$$::The searing, roaring red wall eventually disappeared.[lr]::
24513::$$$message_0214_0048_0002$$$::All that remained was a charred field, strewn with smoldering, blackened lumber.[lr]::
24514::$$$message_0214_0048_0003$$$::I remember that, while I lay there on the ground, the sound of it reminded me of sparklers.::
24515::$$$message_0214_0049_0000$$$::The sky was getting cloudy.[lr]::
24516::$$$message_0214_0049_0001$$$::It should rain soon. That will help put out the fires.[lr]::
24517::$$$message_0214_0049_0002$$$::I could hardly even breathe as I lay there, staring dazedly at the sky.::
24518::$$$message_0214_0050_0000$$$::Charred remains hemmed me in on all sides.[lr]::
24519::$$$message_0214_0050_0001$$$::Burns cover almost my entire body, and there's an especially painful sensation around my chest.[lr]::
24520::$$$message_0214_0050_0002$$$::My chest is gouged out.[lr]::
24521::$$$message_0214_0050_0003$$$::I could probably touch my own insides.::
24522::$$$message_0214_0051_0000$$$::   Oh yeah, I'd forgotten about that.[lr]::
24523::$$$message_0214_0051_0001$$$::I didn't collapse because I got tired.[lr]::
24524::$$$message_0214_0051_0002$$$::It's not that my numb body was trying to do me a favor by letting me rest.[lr]::
24525::$$$message_0214_0051_0003$$$::I collapsed because...[lr]::
24526::$$$message_0214_0051_0004$$$::I was much too hurt to keep moving. At all.::
24527::$$$message_0214_0052_0000$$$::That's why I ended up just accepting it, calmly, no panic...[lr]::
24528::$$$message_0214_0052_0001$$$::I knew I wasn't going to make it. Everyone else was already dead anyway, so I wasn't scared.[lr]::
24529::$$$message_0214_0052_0002$$$::Staring up at the cloudy sky, I felt myself just sort of fading away.[lr]::
24530::$$$message_0214_0052_0003$$$::Yet...[lr]::
24531::$$$message_0214_0052_0004$$$::In the haze of fading consciousness, I decided that as long as I was alive, I'd try calling for help. Right till the end.::
24532::$$$message_0214_0053_0000$$$::...Huh. Wait, something's off...[lr]::
24533::$$$message_0214_0053_0001$$$::I shouldn't be remembering this pain in my chest...::
24534::$$$message_0214_0054_0000$$$::...[lr]::
24535::$$$message_0214_0054_0001$$$::I jerk myself upright...[lr]::
24536::$$$message_0214_0054_0002$$$::...and tug my shirt open to check myself over.::
24537::$$$message_0214_0055_0000$$$::"...Yeah I figured as much. There's no wound."[lr]::
24538::$$$message_0214_0055_0001$$$::There's no scar on my chest.[lr]::
24539::$$$message_0214_0055_0002$$$::The respiratory distress that burn caused did almost kill me, but I didn't take some massive chest wound.[lr]::
24540::$$$message_0214_0055_0003$$$::If something like that had happened, even Kiritsugu wouldn't have been able to help me.[lr]::
24541::$$$message_0214_0055_0004$$$::But more importantly...::
24542::$$$message_0214_0056_0000$$$::"Whoa, it's already night!? Did I fall asleep, Saber!?"::
24543::$$$message_0214_0057_0000$$$::"Yes. You slept deeply, so I did not wish to wake you. It seems to have helped, though. You have regained some of your color."::
24544::$$$message_0214_0058_0000$$$::"That's not very nice. Sure, it might've been my fault for passing out, but you could've woken me up. I told you we don't have time to rest."::
24545::$$$message_0214_0059_0000$$$::"But you [font italic=true]must[font italic=false] rest. And you did so only for about an hour, so it should not be a problem."[lr]::
24546::$$$message_0214_0059_0001$$$::"Hm. That's just the benefit of hindsight. What would you have done if I hadn't woken up?"::
24547::$$$message_0214_0060_0000$$$::"Well, I do not believe our situation would have changed much, actually. I had been about to wake you since the sun is setting and it is growing cold."::
24548::$$$message_0214_0062_0000$$$::"I do admit, I feel a lot better."[lr]::
24549::$$$message_0214_0062_0001$$$::I get up from the bench, and start walking through the field. [lr]::
24550::$$$message_0214_0062_0002$$$::There's no trace of what this field once looked like.[lr]::
24551::$$$message_0214_0062_0003$$$::No trace of when it used to be a residential district, nor any trace of when it was cast in that hellish red light.[lr]::
24552::$$$message_0214_0062_0004$$$::But for some reason, I'm irritated that I dreamed that scene just because I slept here.::
24553::$$$message_0214_0063_0000$$$::"Shirou? Is something wrong?"[lr]::
24554::$$$message_0214_0063_0001$$$::"No. I was just thinking that if I was going to rest, it should've been somewhere else. Too many bad memories here."::
24555::$$$message_0214_0064_0000$$$::"Bad memories? Do you have some link to this place?"::
24556::$$$message_0214_0065_0000$$$::"Eh? Oh, right. I never told you. I used to live around here a long time ago. Ten years ago, actually. There was a giant fire. It burned down my house, with my parents inside. That's when my old man saved me. Later, he adopted me."::
24557::$$$message_0214_0066_0000$$$::"What? So that means you..."[lr]::
24558::$$$message_0214_0066_0001$$$::"Yeah, I'm not Kiritsugu's biological child. And I guess I am not without ties to the Holy Grail War, either.[lr]::
24559::$$$message_0214_0066_0002$$$::I heard that this place was the final battleground during the last war. It's kind of ironic to think that the survivor of this site turned into a Master."::
24560::$$$message_0214_0067_0000$$$::I walk through the field.[lr]::
24561::$$$message_0214_0067_0001$$$::It's been ten years, but it still seems like the ground hasn't recovered enough for even grass to grow.[lr]::
24562::$$$message_0214_0067_0002$$$::Maybe all the resentment of the people who died here seeped into the land itself.::
24563::$$$message_0214_0068_0000$$$::"Shirou. Is that why you are so adamant about not allowing innocents to be harmed?[lr]::
24564::$$$message_0214_0068_0001$$$::As a victim of the Holy Grail War yourself, you are hoping to avoid creating any other such victims?"[lr]::
24565::$$$message_0214_0068_0002$$$::"Eh? Uh...well..."::
24566::$$$message_0214_0069_0000$$$::Now that she mentions it, I guess I can see people coming to that conclusion.[lr]::
24567::$$$message_0214_0069_0001$$$::Surprisingly, I've never thought about it like that.::
24568::$$$message_0214_0070_0000$$$::"I'm not sure. You have a good point, but I think it's something simpler than that.[lr]::
24569::$$$message_0214_0070_0001$$$::Ten years ago, I was so happy when Kiritsugu saved me. I didn't feel anything else at the time, and I think I just aspired to be like him one day too."::
24570::$$$message_0214_0071_0000$$$::Yeah, I was just happy.[lr]::
24571::$$$message_0214_0071_0001$$$::Words can't even begin to describe what I felt when I called out for help...and actually got it.[lr]::
24572::$$$message_0214_0071_0002$$$::But at the same time...[lr]::
24573::$$$message_0214_0071_0003$$$::...the happier I was, the more guilty I felt.::
24574::$$$message_0214_0072_0000$$$::"It didn't feel right though, knowing that my wish was the only one to be granted. My old man saved me. But no one else was saved, and they couldn't do anything about it."::
24575::$$$message_0214_0073_0000$$$::Everyone wished for salvation, but only my wish was granted.[lr]::
24576::$$$message_0214_0073_0001$$$::Only I was saved...[lr]::
24577::$$$message_0214_0073_0002$$$::...and in exchange, everyone else died.[lr]::
24578::$$$message_0214_0073_0003$$$::And that's why...I have to take responsibility.::
24579::$$$message_0214_0074_0000$$$::"But, I can't take back something that's already happened.[lr]::
24580::$$$message_0214_0074_0001$$$::If I want to do something for the people who died, I should focus on preventing what's to come.[lr]::
24581::$$$message_0214_0074_0002$$$::I will not allow another catastrophe like the one ten years ago. If something like that ever happened again, I'd never be able to face the people who got sacrificed that time.[lr]::
24582::$$$message_0214_0074_0003$$$::At least, that's how I see it."::
24583::$$$message_0214_0075_0000$$$::More importantly, we need to get back to looking for Shinji.[lr]::
24584::$$$message_0214_0075_0001$$$::I feel better now, and we need to hurry up and check the buildings we haven't gotten to yet.[lr]::
24585::$$$message_0214_0075_0002$$$::Besides, there should be fewer people around at night.[lr]::
24586::$$$message_0214_0075_0003$$$::If Shinji wants to attack us, this'll be the time.[lr]::
24587::$$$message_0214_0075_0004$$$::So if our plan is to be bait to lure him out, it's time to get to it.::
24588::$$$message_0214_0076_0000$$$::"Let's go, Saber. Let's get back to the office district."[lr]::
24589::$$$message_0214_0076_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
24590::$$$message_0214_0076_0002$$$::"Saber? What's wrong? Did you forget something?"::
24591::$$$message_0214_0077_0000$$$::"No. I was just recalling what happened this morning.[lr]::
24592::$$$message_0214_0077_0001$$$::I suggested you focus on healing your wounds before going out looking for Rider's Master, but you told me our priorities were mixed up."[lr]::
24593::$$$message_0214_0077_0002$$$::"Hm?"::
24594::$$$message_0214_0078_0000$$$::"You mentioned the same thing yesterday. I have believed this for some time, but now I am certain.[lr]::
24595::$$$message_0214_0078_0001$$$::You do not value your own life."[lr]::
24596::$$$message_0214_0078_0002$$$::It's like...[lr]::
24597::$$$message_0214_0078_0003$$$::...she just stares at me and lays it out, like it's a sin or something.::
24598::$$$message_0214_0079_0000$$$::"You put others ahead of yourself. Admirable though that may be, you will one day regret doing so.[lr]::
24599::$$$message_0214_0079_0001$$$::You should value yourself more, Shirou."[lr]::
24600::$$$message_0214_0079_0002$$$::Saber cuts past me.::
24601::$$$message_0214_0080_0000$$$::"Let us go. Being here is clearly not good for you."[lr]::
24602::$$$message_0214_0080_0001$$$::Saber heads toward the office district.[lr]::
24603::$$$message_0214_0080_0002$$$::I try to call out to her, but I can't stop her.::
24604::$$$message_0214_0081_0000$$$::"...What?"[lr]::
24605::$$$message_0214_0081_0001$$$::...are you saying? That's what I want to ask her, but the words just won't come.[lr]::
24606::$$$message_0214_0081_0002$$$::There's no way I'm not trying to help myself.[lr]::
24607::$$$message_0214_0081_0003$$$::That can't be true, but I somehow can't think of a single thing to say to argue with her.::
