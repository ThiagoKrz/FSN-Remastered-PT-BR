17807::$$$message_0166_0000_0000$$$::It's noon, and we eat lunch.[lr]::
17808::$$$message_0166_0000_0001$$$::I made a hearty breakfast, so lunch is boxed leftovers.::
17809::$$$message_0166_0001_0000$$$::"I see, you have taken the dishes from this morning and put them between slices of bread."::
17810::$$$message_0166_0002_0000$$$::Saber nods her approval as she eats her sandwich.[lr]::
17811::$$$message_0166_0002_0001$$$::The way she uses a paper napkin to keep her hands from getting dirty...there's such grace even in the way she eats a bento.::
17812::$$$message_0166_0003_0000$$$::"Yep. I realized this during breakfast: you're a good cook, Shirou.[lr]::
17813::$$$message_0166_0003_0001$$$::It's nice that the food is so good."::
17814::$$$message_0166_0004_0000$$$::On the other end of the spectrum, Illya eagerly crams her sandwich into her mouth.[lr]::
17815::$$$message_0166_0004_0001$$$::I can't tell if she's just playing around, or copying me.[lr]::
17816::$$$message_0166_0004_0002$$$::Illya seems to have better manners than Saber, except at the table.::
17817::$$$message_0166_0005_0000$$$::"Hold it, Illyasviel. If you eat like that, your hair will get dirty."[lr]::
17818::$$$message_0166_0005_0001$$$::Illya must have had butter smeared on the corner of her mouth or something. Saber leans in reluctantly, wiping off whatever it is.::
17819::$$$message_0166_0006_0000$$$::"Thanks. But what's the big idea? I thought you didn't like me, Saber."::
17820::$$$message_0166_0007_0000$$$::"I am wary of you, yes. But even I understand people's feelings.[lr]::
17821::$$$message_0166_0007_0001$$$::You have no hostility, and Shirou has accepted you as a guest.[lr]::
17822::$$$message_0166_0007_0002$$$::That is why I will show you a bare minimum of courtesy. And besides..."[lr]::
17823::$$$message_0166_0007_0003$$$::"Besides...?"::
17824::$$$message_0166_0008_0000$$$::"Your hair is beautiful. It pains me to see it getting so dirty."::
17825::$$$message_0166_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
17826::$$$message_0166_0010_0000$$$::"Hmph. Shirou's still mine, you know.[lr]::
17827::$$$message_0166_0010_0001$$$::Well, I can maybe consider being a little friendly with you. I can make Shirou win, but I can't protect him, after all."::
17828::$$$message_0166_0011_0000$$$::Illya shrugs and takes another bite of her sandwich.::
17829::$$$message_0166_0012_0000$$$::"You do not need to remind me. It is the duty of a Servant to be their Master's shield."[lr]::
17830::$$$message_0166_0012_0001$$$::Saber responds plainly enough as they eat.[lr]::
17831::$$$message_0166_0012_0002$$$::Their conversation hasn't changed much, but at least they sound calmer.::
17832::$$$message_0166_0013_0000$$$::As we relax after finishing our meal, Tohsaka comes in.[lr]::
17833::$$$message_0166_0013_0001$$$::"Shirou, are you here? I'm ready, so come by as soon as you can."[lr]::
17834::$$$message_0166_0013_0002$$$::Her message delivered, Tohsaka heads straight back to the outbuilding.::
17835::$$$message_0166_0014_0000$$$::"Oh right, I forgot. Tohsaka was going to teach me magecraft in the afternoon."::
17836::$$$message_0166_0015_0000$$$::I've never had a proper teacher, so Tohsaka's magecraft lectures have been really helpful.[lr]::
17837::$$$message_0166_0015_0001$$$::She seems to be willing to keep teaching, so I should clean up here quickly and head over to her.::
17838::$$$message_0166_0016_0000$$$::"Sorry, but I'm going to head to Tohsaka's room.[lr]::
17839::$$$message_0166_0016_0001$$$::I'm not sure how long it's going to take, so you two should go back to your rooms and rest."::
17840::$$$message_0166_0017_0000$$$::"Okay. I'm a little tired, so I'll take a nap."[lr]::
17841::$$$message_0166_0017_0001$$$::Illya walks out of the dojo, rubbing her sleepy eyes.[lr]::
17842::$$$message_0166_0017_0002$$$::That's a relief.[lr]::
17843::$$$message_0166_0017_0003$$$::As long as Illya goes to sleep, I don't think there's any problem with me going to Tohsaka's room.::
17844::$$$message_0166_0018_0000$$$::"Shirou. Are you going to go to Rin's room?"[lr]::
17845::$$$message_0166_0018_0001$$$::"Hm? Yeah, I just said that. Tohsaka's teaching me the basics of magecraft."::
17846::$$$message_0166_0019_0000$$$::"Is that really necessary? With Berserker gone, there are no more enemies that require our alliance to defeat.[lr]::
17847::$$$message_0166_0019_0001$$$::Would that not mean there is nothing more for you to learn from Rin?"::
17848::$$$message_0166_0020_0000$$$::Hm. She might be right.[lr]::
17849::$$$message_0166_0020_0001$$$::Tohsaka's lessons were originally meant to help me when we went up against Berserker.[lr]::
17850::$$$message_0166_0020_0002$$$::So with him gone, there's no reason for her to teach me anything else.::
17851::$$$message_0166_0021_0000$$$::"No. Berserker or not, I do still want to learn from her.[lr]::
17852::$$$message_0166_0021_0001$$$::There's still so much I don't know as a mage, and I'd like to fix that as soon as I can."::
17853::$$$message_0166_0022_0000$$$::"I see. If you insist, then I have no business stopping you."[lr]::
17854::$$$message_0166_0022_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
17855::$$$message_0166_0022_0002$$$::Saber looks sullen as she says this.::>
