52783::$$$message_0455_0000_0000$$$::...Oh, I know.[lr]::
52784::$$$message_0455_0000_0001$$$::She might be feeling down because I made her wait, but I still have a chance to cheer her up.::
52785::$$$message_0455_0001_0000$$$::"Illya, I have a suggestion."[lr]::
52786::$$$message_0455_0001_0001$$$::"What? This better be good."::
52787::$$$message_0455_0002_0000$$$::"Yeah. I'll apologize with my actions, not my words.[lr]::
52788::$$$message_0455_0002_0001$$$::Do you want to come over to my place? I'll make you some tea and treats."::
52789::$$$message_0455_0003_0000$$$::"Huh? Y-you mean your house!?"[lr]::
52790::$$$message_0455_0003_0001$$$::"Where else would it be? There shouldn't be anyone there now[line2]oh, Saber won't attack you, don't worry.[lr]::
52791::$$$message_0455_0003_0002$$$::It isn't the park, but it would be nice to relax over tea sometime, don't you think?"::
52792::$$$message_0455_0004_0000$$$::"Hmm... That is kind of a good idea, but...I don't know if I can intrude on your home."::
52793::$$$message_0455_0005_0000$$$::"That isn't the point. You showed me your castle, remember? Now I'm returning the favor."[lr]::
52794::$$$message_0455_0005_0001$$$::"...Okay. Yeah, you did say that."[lr]::
52795::$$$message_0455_0005_0002$$$::Illya mutters, as if persuading herself.::
52796::$$$message_0455_0006_0000$$$::Then, she looks at me again.[lr]::
52797::$$$message_0455_0006_0001$$$::"Can I really come over to your house, though? I came here to kill you and Kiritsugu. Should you really let me into your home?"[lr]::
52798::$$$message_0455_0006_0002$$$::She asks me, in an emotionless voice.::
52799::$$$message_0455_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
52800::$$$message_0455_0007_0001$$$::I can't possibly know the significance of her words.[lr]::
52801::$$$message_0455_0007_0002$$$::This Einzbern girl came here to kill my old man.[lr]::
52802::$$$message_0455_0007_0003$$$::It's the reason she's been after my life, too.[lr]::
52803::$$$message_0455_0007_0004$$$::...I've known that for a while now.::
52804::$$$message_0455_0008_0000$$$::Kiritsugu betrayed the Einzberns.[lr]::
52805::$$$message_0455_0008_0001$$$::Then, he threw everything away to live out his days in this town.[lr]::
52806::$$$message_0455_0008_0002$$$::   Until I became a Master, I had no inkling of the sacrifices he made.::
52807::$$$message_0455_0009_0000$$$::I doubt Illya can forgive Kiritsugu, and she probably sincerely means to kill me.[lr]::
52808::$$$message_0455_0009_0001$$$::But regardless[line2]no, [font italic=true]especially[font italic=false] because of that, I think I should invite this girl to the Emiya house.::
52809::$$$message_0455_0010_0000$$$::"Yeah. This has nothing to do with being Masters. I want you to come over and enjoy yourself."[lr]::
52810::$$$message_0455_0010_0001$$$::I give Illya a straight answer.::
52811::$$$message_0455_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
52812::$$$message_0455_0011_0001$$$::She stops breathing for a second, looking shocked.[lr]::
52813::$$$message_0455_0011_0002$$$::"...Okay! Thanks, big brother!"[lr]::
52814::$$$message_0455_0011_0003$$$::She gives me a buoyant smile and hugs my arm.::
52815::$$$message_0455_0012_0000$$$::"Okay. Hold on a second, Illya. I'm going to talk to Saber."[lr]::
52816::$$$message_0455_0012_0001$$$::I roll up my sleeves and stare at the front door.::
52817::$$$message_0455_0013_0000$$$::"Good luck, Shirou!"[lr]::
52818::$$$message_0455_0013_0001$$$::Illya cheers me on with a wave.[lr]::
52819::$$$message_0455_0013_0002$$$::Here goes nothing.[lr]::
52820::$$$message_0455_0013_0003$$$::With encouragement like that, I need to do whatever it takes to convince Saber to approve this visit.::
52821::$$$message_0455_0014_0000$$$::"I must firmly decline."[lr]::
52822::$$$message_0455_0014_0001$$$::And she shoots me down within one second.::
52823::$$$message_0455_0015_0000$$$::"Urgh. I get how you feel. I know exactly what you're saying.[lr]::
52824::$$$message_0455_0015_0001$$$::You think that inviting a Master[line2]Berserker's Master, no less[line2]into my home base is suicide. I know. I understand that very well. But still[line2]"::
52825::$$$message_0455_0016_0000$$$::"No, you do [font italic=true]not[font italic=false] understand, Shirou! This is Illyasviel we're talking about! A Master of her caliber will be able to expose all of this house's weaknesses, and she would have no difficulty destroying the Bounded Field! And you would invite her in!? This is more than entering a lion's den[line2]you are drinking poison of of your own will!"::
52826::$$$message_0455_0016_0001$$$::"Ergh...b-but I can promise that Illya won't do anything. Plus, she didn't bring Berserker::
52827::$$$message_0455_0016_0002$$$::with her, and she says that she won't fight before the sun's down. Right now, she's just a girl,::
52828::$$$message_0455_0016_0003$$$::so I don't think you need to nitpick her like that."::
52829::$$$message_0455_0017_0000$$$::"Gender has nothing to do with it! To begin with, what have you been doing with her behind my back!? Did you forget that she tried to kill you? How can you show sympathy for her? Decency is one thing, but this is sheer idiocy!"::
52830::$$$message_0455_0017_0001$$$::"Oof. But you'll see she's a good kid if you talk to her.[lr]::
52831::$$$message_0455_0017_0002$$$::She still doesn't understand morality, so we just need to teach her the difference between good and evil."::
52832::$$$message_0455_0018_0000$$$::"How naive! You would trust the word of the Einzbern Master!? Their clan exists only to acquire the Holy Grail. She will break any promise to you in an instant!"::
52833::$$$message_0455_0018_0001$$$::"...! No, she won't! You're going too far, Saber! Illya is Illya.::
52834::$$$message_0455_0018_0002$$$::I don't know what the Einzberns are like, but don't lump her in with them!"::
52835::$$$message_0455_0019_0000$$$::"......Indeed. What you say is correct, Shirou."[lr]::
52836::$$$message_0455_0019_0001$$$::"...! Then, Saber...[line2]"[lr]::
52837::$$$message_0455_0019_0002$$$::"Though I must say, your voice was so meek, you were not persuasive in the least."::
52838::$$$message_0455_0020_0000$$$::"Ah...um..."[lr]::
52839::$$$message_0455_0020_0001$$$::It's because of how angry she was. Is that so wrong of me?::
52840::$$$message_0455_0021_0000$$$::"...Very well, I understand. At this rate, you will be forced to use a Command Spell. You trust Illyasviel, and I trust you."[lr]::
52841::$$$message_0455_0021_0001$$$::"Saber..."::
52842::$$$message_0455_0022_0000$$$::"But I will not meet her. I cannot guarantee that I will keep my composure if I see her face-to-face, and my presence would only put her on her guard."::
52843::$$$message_0455_0023_0000$$$::"Oh...all right. Then what are you going to do?"[lr]::
52844::$$$message_0455_0023_0001$$$::"I will stand by in the guestroom I used before. Do not worry. I will come running at the first sign of danger."::
52845::$$$message_0455_0024_0000$$$::"...Okay. Sorry, Saber. This is, um..."[lr]::
52846::$$$message_0455_0024_0001$$$::"I know. I'm the one who told you about Kiritsugu's connection to the Holy Grail War, so I should have been prepared for this eventuality."[lr]::
52847::$$$message_0455_0024_0002$$$::Saber sighs and goes off to the guestroom.::
52848::$$$message_0455_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
52849::$$$message_0455_0025_0001$$$::...That makes sense.[lr]::
52850::$$$message_0455_0025_0002$$$::Saber was Kiritsugu's Servant last time.[lr]::
52851::$$$message_0455_0025_0003$$$::I wouldn't be surprised if she realized Illya's relationship to Kiritsugu.::
52852::$$$message_0455_0026_0000$$$::"Pardon the intrusion! So this is your house, Shirou."[lr]::
52853::$$$message_0455_0026_0001$$$::Illya enters the house timidly, despite her spirited greeting.::
52854::$$$message_0455_0027_0000$$$::"I'll make tea first. Come on, the living room is this way."[lr]::
52855::$$$message_0455_0027_0001$$$::"Okay! Oh, you have a wooden-floored hall. It's really a Japanese building, just like I heard."[lr]::
52856::$$$message_0455_0027_0002$$$::Illya gawks in every direction while she walks.::
52857::$$$message_0455_0028_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
52858::$$$message_0455_0028_0001$$$::Well, it must be a pretty unusual sight for her, since she lives in a castle.::
52859::$$$message_0455_0029_0000$$$::"Here's your tea. At first I was going to make you black tea, but I'm not good at it, plus it can't measure up to what you have at home anyway, so it's Japanese tea. If it's too bitter, just let me know. I can dilute it."::
52860::$$$message_0455_0030_0000$$$::I hold out a second cup of hot water.[lr]::
52861::$$$message_0455_0030_0001$$$::I used the best green tea I have, so there shouldn't be any complaints about the flavor. It's just a matter of whether she prefers bitter or sweet tea.::
52862::$$$message_0455_0031_0000$$$::"Mm. Thanks, Shirou."[lr]::
52863::$$$message_0455_0031_0001$$$::Illya sits down properly and takes a nervous sip of the tea.::
52864::$$$message_0455_0032_0000$$$::"Mm..."[lr]::
52865::$$$message_0455_0032_0001$$$::Illya freezes.[lr]::
52866::$$$message_0455_0032_0002$$$::...Figures. I went out of my way, but maybe I should have just made her milk tea or something.::
52867::$$$message_0455_0033_0000$$$::"Sorry, it must be bitter. Don't force yourself to drink it. I'll make you a new one."[lr]::
52868::$$$message_0455_0033_0001$$$::"Huh? N-no, that's not it. Um, the tea was very well-brewed."::
52869::$$$message_0455_0034_0000$$$::Illya bows and compliments me in the traditional manner. I wonder where she learned to do that.[lr]::
52870::$$$message_0455_0034_0001$$$::Then, little by little, she starts sipping the tea.::
52871::$$$message_0455_0035_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
52872::$$$message_0455_0035_0001$$$::I won't stop her if that's what she wants.[lr]::
52873::$$$message_0455_0035_0002$$$::Along with the tea, I present a collection of well-regarded Japanese sweets[lr]::
52874::$$$message_0455_0035_0003$$$::that we always have with tea.::
52875::$$$message_0455_0036_0000$$$::Once tea time is over, Illya wants to explore the house.::
52876::$$$message_0455_0037_0000$$$::"Sure. It isn't very interesting, though."[lr]::
52877::$$$message_0455_0037_0001$$$::"That's okay. I just want to see. I knew as soon as I came in that it has no magical value, so you can just show me around."::
52878::$$$message_0455_0038_0000$$$::And so,[lr]::
52879::$$$message_0455_0038_0001$$$::I take Illya on a walking tour of my house, while she gives running commentary: ::
52880::$$$message_0455_0039_0000$$$::"Huh. It's more spacious than I expected. You've got glass windows lining one side of the hallways. Isn't that bad if someone attacks you?"[lr]::
52881::$$$message_0455_0039_0001$$$::for instance.::
52882::$$$message_0455_0040_0000$$$::"Wait, this is your room!? I can't believe someone actually lives in here!"[lr]::
52883::$$$message_0455_0040_0001$$$::for instance.::
52884::$$$message_0455_0041_0000$$$::"This is the backyard? Japanese mages have it tough. You can't grow anything in a tiny garden like this."[lr]::
52885::$$$message_0455_0041_0001$$$::for instance.::
52886::$$$message_0455_0042_0000$$$::"I know what this is! A dojo, right?[lr]::
52887::$$$message_0455_0042_0001$$$::Grandfather told me it's a place where barefoot savages swing swords at each other!"[lr]::
52888::$$$message_0455_0042_0002$$$::for instance.::
52889::$$$message_0455_0043_0000$$$::"No! I don't want to see your shed! That's a place for servants to use!"[lr]::
52890::$$$message_0455_0043_0001$$$::for instance.::
52891::$$$message_0455_0044_0000$$$::...She sure has a lot to say about it all.[lr]::
52892::$$$message_0455_0044_0001$$$::Still, it looks like she's having fun.::
52893::$$$message_0455_0045_0000$$$::"Hey, what's next!? We haven't been over there, come on!"[lr]::
52894::$$$message_0455_0045_0001$$$::She hurries me along.::
52895::$$$message_0455_0046_0000$$$::"Fine, fine. This is the back part of the house. We haven't used it in the last few years, so don't mind the dust."[lr]::
52896::$$$message_0455_0046_0001$$$::Illya runs down the hallway, shouting excitedly.::
52897::$$$message_0455_0047_0000$$$::"Whew."[lr]::
52898::$$$message_0455_0047_0001$$$::Damn, though.[lr]::
52899::$$$message_0455_0047_0002$$$::I don't know why she's so happy to be here, but that alone makes it worth the trouble.::
52900::$$$message_0455_0048_0000$$$::   But...[lr]::
52901::$$$message_0455_0048_0001$$$::In the middle of it, Illya settles down, and she just looks through the rooms. Maybe she's tired.[lr]::
52902::$$$message_0455_0048_0002$$$::Illya goes through the rest of the house without saying a word.[lr]::
52903::$$$message_0455_0048_0003$$$::I give her the remainder of the tour, and then we're back in the living room.::
52904::$$$message_0455_0049_0000$$$::"That's all. There's a separate guesthouse, but we'll have to skip that today.[lr]::
52905::$$$message_0455_0049_0001$$$::Saber's sleeping in there."[lr]::
52906::$$$message_0455_0049_0002$$$::From behind, she looks dispirited.::
52907::$$$message_0455_0050_0000$$$::"Oh. That's all, huh."[lr]::
52908::$$$message_0455_0050_0001$$$::"...Illya? What's wrong? Are you tired?"::
52909::$$$message_0455_0051_0000$$$::"Yeah, a little. There's no one here."[lr]::
52910::$$$message_0455_0051_0001$$$::When she turns to look at me, she looks like a little girl her age.::
52911::$$$message_0455_0052_0000$$$::She's just Illya, not a Master.[lr]::
52912::$$$message_0455_0052_0001$$$::"I came here for revenge. But I'm sad that there's no one here to take revenge on."[lr]::
52913::$$$message_0455_0052_0002$$$::She murmurs to herself. Silent tears fall down her cheeks.::
52914::$$$message_0455_0053_0000$$$::"Huh? That's weird. I'm crying. There isn't anything to be sad about or scared of."[lr]::
52915::$$$message_0455_0053_0001$$$::Illya looks sincerely puzzled.::
52916::$$$message_0455_0054_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
52917::$$$message_0455_0054_0001$$$::There's a reason, of course.[lr]::
52918::$$$message_0455_0054_0002$$$::The person she resented for years[lr]::
52919::$$$message_0455_0054_0003$$$::isn't here in this house.[lr]::
52920::$$$message_0455_0054_0004$$$::She came here with only vengeance and murder on her mind, and missed her chance to achieve closure.[lr]::
52921::$$$message_0455_0054_0005$$$::Illyasviel von Einzbern.[lr]::
52922::$$$message_0455_0054_0006$$$::She has her reasons for wanting to kill me and Kiritsugu.[lr]::
52923::$$$message_0455_0054_0007$$$::And that would be...::
52924::$$$message_0455_0055_0000$$$::"Let's go, Shirou. I should go home before the sun sets.[lr]::
52925::$$$message_0455_0055_0001$$$::We'll end up fighting unless we say goodbye before it's nighttime."[lr]::
52926::$$$message_0455_0055_0002$$$::Illya states that fact with a smile.[lr]::
52927::$$$message_0455_0055_0003$$$::What should I say to that?::
52928::$$$message_0455_0056_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I'll walk you to the park."[lr]::
52929::$$$message_0455_0056_0001$$$::"Okay. You sure know how to treat a lady."[lr]::
52930::$$$message_0455_0056_0002$$$::Her smile is so innocent.[lr]::
52931::$$$message_0455_0056_0003$$$::Illya runs to the front door like nothing happened, her silver hair swaying.::
52932::$$$message_0455_0057_0000$$$::...And that's the third time I said farewell to her.[lr]::
52933::$$$message_0455_0057_0001$$$::My footsteps feel heavy on the way home.[lr]::
52934::$$$message_0455_0057_0002$$$::I take my time, as if walking through the familiar town and streets for the first time.::
52935::$$$message_0455_0058_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
52936::$$$message_0455_0058_0001$$$::I have a lot to think about.[lr]::
52937::$$$message_0455_0058_0002$$$::And I've been made to realize how important Illya is to me.::
52938::$$$message_0455_0059_0000$$$::"Pops. Should Illya and I..."[lr]::
52939::$$$message_0455_0059_0001$$$::...fight each other as Masters?[lr]::
52940::$$$message_0455_0059_0002$$$::Or should I convince Illya to quit this war?::
52941::$$$message_0455_0060_0000$$$::"The Makiris and Einzberns have an especially deep obsession.[lr]::
52942::$$$message_0455_0060_0001$$$::They have sought the Grail for five hundred and one thousand years, respectively."::
52943::$$$message_0455_0061_0000$$$::That's what Kotomine said.[lr]::
52944::$$$message_0455_0061_0001$$$::Is there a way to pull Illya away from people who have been after the Holy Grail for such a long time?[lr]::
52945::$$$message_0455_0061_0002$$$::No, before even that...[lr]::
52946::$$$message_0455_0061_0003$$$::Right now, I don't know how to set her free from her desire for vengeance.::
52947::$$$message_0455_0062_0000$$$::I return to the Emiya house.[lr]::
52948::$$$message_0455_0062_0001$$$::The sunset bathes the town in twilight.::
52949::$$$message_0455_0063_0000$$$::"Okay. I need to get my head back on straight."[lr]::
52950::$$$message_0455_0063_0001$$$::I clap my cheeks to clear my mind.[lr]::
52951::$$$message_0455_0063_0002$$$::I have to deal with Illya and Shinji eventually, but the top priority now is stopping Caster from attacking any more people.::
52952::$$$message_0455_0064_0000$$$::I won't let the tragedy of ten years ago repeat itself.[lr]::
52953::$$$message_0455_0064_0001$$$::That's why I decided to be a Master and fight with Saber.::
