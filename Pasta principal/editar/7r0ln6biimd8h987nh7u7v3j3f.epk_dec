12291::$$$message_0122_0000_0000$$$::...I wonder if Saber's really okay.[lr]::
12292::$$$message_0122_0000_0001$$$::She says she has no problems fighting, but wouldn't it be hard for her to go up against Berserker when she's so weak?::
12293::$$$message_0122_0001_0000$$$::Or...I suppose I'm more concerned about her Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
12294::$$$message_0122_0001_0001$$$::[font italic=true]I will not be able to maintain my body if I use it.[font italic=false][r][wsay canskip=1]::
12295::$$$message_0122_0001_0002$$$::That's what Saber said.[lr]::
12296::$$$message_0122_0001_0003$$$::That means Saber will disappear the instant she uses that attack.::
12297::$$$message_0122_0002_0000$$$::"...Saber."[lr]::
12298::$$$message_0122_0002_0001$$$::"Yes, what is it, Shirou?"[lr]::
12299::$$$message_0122_0002_0002$$$::Ah...before we go out to fight, can you promise me one thing?"[lr]::
12300::$$$message_0122_0002_0003$$$::"Hm? Yes, as long as it is something I can do."::
12301::$$$message_0122_0003_0000$$$::"Okay. Well...yeah. I don't want you to use your Noble Phantasm, no matter what happens.[lr]::
12302::$$$message_0122_0003_0001$$$::It's important, and I don't want you to die, even if it means we defeat Berserker."::
12303::$$$message_0122_0004_0000$$$::"Yes. I understand. I do not intend to use my Noble Phantasm either. I do not think I will be able to defeat Berserker with the amount of magical energy I have, and more importantly, I will be unable to obtain the Holy Grail if I disappear."[lr]::
12304::$$$message_0122_0004_0001$$$::She's as direct as ever.[lr]::
12305::$$$message_0122_0004_0002$$$::It's a relief to hear.::
12306::$$$message_0122_0005_0000$$$::"Okay. Yeah, that's the Saber that I know. It's good to hear you being so insanely calm."[lr]::
12307::$$$message_0122_0005_0001$$$::"Hm? And what do you mean by that, Shirou?"[lr]::
12308::$$$message_0122_0005_0002$$$::"Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's just get going. Tohsaka will get upset again if we keep her waiting."::
12309::$$$message_0122_0006_0000$$$::"Yes. It appears complaining to you has become something of a hobby of hers."[lr]::
12310::$$$message_0122_0006_0001$$$::And with that kind of weird observation, Saber turns to leave the ruins.::
12311::$$$message_0122_0007_0000$$$::   But then.[lr]::
12312::$$$message_0122_0007_0001$$$::She trips on a chunk of rubble and stumbles forward.[lr]::
12313::$$$message_0122_0007_0002$$$::"Oh!"[lr]::
12314::$$$message_0122_0007_0003$$$::I quickly grab her hand from behind.::
12315::$$$message_0122_0008_0000$$$::"Come on, watch your step. You'll need to be careful in this mess..."[lr]::
12316::$$$message_0122_0008_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
12317::$$$message_0122_0008_0002$$$::Huh.[lr]::
12318::$$$message_0122_0008_0003$$$::Saber seems to be blushing.::
12319::$$$message_0122_0009_0000$$$::"Saber? What's wrong? Did something happen?"[lr]::
12320::$$$message_0122_0009_0001$$$::"No. It is nothing...but if you hold my hand like that, I..."[lr]::
12321::$$$message_0122_0009_0002$$$::Saber's face turns a deep crimson.[lr]::
12322::$$$message_0122_0009_0003$$$::She must look like I did a few minutes ago.::
12323::$$$message_0122_0010_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
12324::$$$message_0122_0010_0001$$$::I find myself blushing too now.[lr]::
12325::$$$message_0122_0010_0002$$$::With her hand in mine... I suddenly remember the sensations I felt with Saber, and quickly pull my hand back.::
12326::$$$message_0122_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
12327::$$$message_0122_0011_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
12328::$$$message_0122_0011_0002$$$::The two of us stand rigidly, saying nothing.::
12329::$$$message_0122_0012_0000$$$::"L-let's head out. We'd better get moving. We don't have much time."[lr]::
12330::$$$message_0122_0012_0001$$$::"Y-yes. Let us hurry, Shirou."[lr]::
12331::$$$message_0122_0012_0002$$$::We head out after that bit of awkwardness.::
12332::$$$message_0122_0013_0000$$$::Once we're outside, we'll never come back here.[lr]::
12333::$$$message_0122_0013_0001$$$::I look back towards the ruin for the last time, and then turn back to the battlefield.Ό‰θι
