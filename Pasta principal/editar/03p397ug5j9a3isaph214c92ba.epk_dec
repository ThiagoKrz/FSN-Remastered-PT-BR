56499::$$$message_0499_0000_0000$$$::"Wait! Didn't you want to team up because you can't save people by yourself!?"[lr]::
56500::$$$message_0499_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56501::$$$message_0499_0001_0001$$$::I stop.[lr]::
56502::$$$message_0499_0001_0002$$$::Her words are like cool water on my boiling head.::
56503::$$$message_0499_0002_0000$$$::"...Sorry. But Sakura's still in danger. I know it's suicidal to go in by myself, but I don't have a choice."::
56504::$$$message_0499_0003_0000$$$::"Yeah. If Shinji brought Sakura along, I can't help you on such short notice.[lr]::
56505::$$$message_0499_0003_0001$$$::But remember, if you can somehow get Sakura away from him, I'll take care of the rest."::
56506::$$$message_0499_0004_0000$$$::"Take care of what? Shinji?"[lr]::
56507::$$$message_0499_0004_0001$$$::"Rider, not Shinji. You need a Servant to fight another Servant.[lr]::
56508::$$$message_0499_0004_0002$$$::I'll be hiding as close by as possible, so just focus on saving Sakura. If you can do that, I swear I'll come rescue you, even if you're one second away from death."::
56509::$$$message_0499_0005_0000$$$::Tohsaka says it like she's trying to convince herself.[lr]::
56510::$$$message_0499_0005_0001$$$::...I know this is going to be a heavy burden on her.[lr]::
56511::$$$message_0499_0005_0002$$$::I'm asking her help with that in mind, and she's promising to honor our alliance.::
56512::$$$message_0499_0006_0000$$$::The reassurance warms my enraged heart.[lr]::
56513::$$$message_0499_0006_0001$$$::I can count on Tohsaka.[lr]::
56514::$$$message_0499_0006_0002$$$::In exchange, I need to get Sakura out of there unharmed.::
56515::$$$message_0499_0007_0000$$$::"All right. I'll let you back me up."[lr]::
56516::$$$message_0499_0007_0001$$$::"Good. But that's only on the condition that you stay safe and protect Sakura.[lr]::
56517::$$$message_0499_0007_0002$$$::No matter how well Archer handles Rider, he can't protect Sakura at the same time. And if you give up your own life to save her, that's completely pointless."::
56518::$$$message_0499_0008_0000$$$::There's no sign of anyone on campus.[lr]::
56519::$$$message_0499_0008_0001$$$::School has been sending students home early ever since the mass comas spread.[lr]::
56520::$$$message_0499_0008_0002$$$::It's almost 6:00 PM. There probably aren't even any teachers still on campus, let alone students.::
56521::$$$message_0499_0009_0000$$$::"Do you know where Shinji is, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
56522::$$$message_0499_0009_0001$$$::"...Knowing him, he'll be in the building. I bet he's set up somewhere high-up and familiar."[lr]::
56523::$$$message_0499_0009_0002$$$::Only one place fits those conditions.[lr]::
56524::$$$message_0499_0009_0003$$$::Shinji's in a classroom on the third floor.::
56525::$$$message_0499_0010_0000$$$::"I'm going on ahead. Come after me once you can."[lr]::
56526::$$$message_0499_0010_0001$$$::"...Yeah. I'll sneak in through the front gate once enough time passes.[lr]::
56527::$$$message_0499_0010_0002$$$::I haven't told you yet, but there's a Bounded Field up around the school. They'll detect us even if we try to hide our presence, so I need you to distract Shinji and Rider."::
56528::$$$message_0499_0011_0000$$$::I nod once and start running.[lr]::
56529::$$$message_0499_0011_0001$$$::    I feel hot iron enter my back.[lr]::
56530::$$$message_0499_0011_0002$$$::I've already activated my Magic Circuit.[lr]::
56531::$$$message_0499_0011_0003$$$::I tell my impatient self that my only weapon, Strengthening, is for protecting Sakura, not defeating my enemies.::
56532::$$$message_0499_0012_0000$$$::"!"[lr]::
56533::$$$message_0499_0012_0001$$$::I stop.[lr]::
56534::$$$message_0499_0012_0002$$$::On the third floor, I find a dark-clothed Servant and Shinji with Sakura next to him. He's holding a knife, its tip pointed at Sakura.::
56535::$$$message_0499_0013_0000$$$::"Damn you!"[lr]::
56536::$$$message_0499_0013_0001$$$::I move on impulse.[lr]::
56537::$$$message_0499_0013_0002$$$::My legs start sprinting again.[lr]::
56538::$$$message_0499_0013_0003$$$::The dark Servant, Rider, blocks my path.::
56539::$$$message_0499_0014_0000$$$::"Stop. We cannot guarantee her safety if you come any closer."[lr]::
56540::$$$message_0499_0014_0001$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
56541::$$$message_0499_0014_0002$$$::I force myself to halt.[lr]::
56542::$$$message_0499_0014_0003$$$::My mouth hurts.[lr]::
56543::$$$message_0499_0014_0004$$$::I'm grinding my teeth together so hard they're squeaking.::
56544::$$$message_0499_0015_0000$$$::"Shinji!"[lr]::
56545::$$$message_0499_0015_0001$$$::"Hey, there. You came charging in, just like I expected. Knowing you, you actually came all alone."[lr]::
56546::$$$message_0499_0016_0000$$$::"Ngh!"[lr]::
56547::$$$message_0499_0016_0001$$$::My mind goes white-hot with rage, despite my attempts to suppress it.[lr]::
56548::$$$message_0499_0016_0002$$$::I feel so dizzy from anger, I almost can't see Rider right in front of me.::
56549::$$$message_0499_0017_0000$$$::"...What's going on?"[lr]::
56550::$$$message_0499_0017_0001$$$::Why is he doing this?[lr]::
56551::$$$message_0499_0017_0002$$$::I'm the one who Shinji hates, right?[lr]::
56552::$$$message_0499_0017_0003$$$::He didn't need to go to such lengths to call me out here.::
56553::$$$message_0499_0018_0000$$$::Sakura is Shinji's sister.[lr]::
56554::$$$message_0499_0018_0001$$$::A big brother should protect his sister.[lr]::
56555::$$$message_0499_0018_0002$$$::Close family should help each other, and smile together.[lr]::
56556::$$$message_0499_0018_0003$$$::So why is he doing this?[lr]::
56557::$$$message_0499_0018_0004$$$::                            How can a big brother do this to his little sister's feelings,[lr]::
56558::$$$message_0499_0018_0005$$$::when I couldn't do anything to help!?::
56559::$$$message_0499_0019_0000$$$::"Are you serious, Shinji!?"[lr]::
56560::$$$message_0499_0019_0001$$$::"Of course. That's why I'm here, waiting for you. You fallin' asleep on me now?"::
56561::$$$message_0499_0020_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
56562::$$$message_0499_0020_0001$$$::My body leans forward.[lr]::
56563::$$$message_0499_0020_0002$$$::I won't feel at ease until I run in there right now and pull Sakura away from Shinji.::
56564::$$$message_0499_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56565::$$$message_0499_0021_0001$$$::But she's in the way.[lr]::
56566::$$$message_0499_0021_0002$$$::Rider blocks my approach to Shinji, protecting him.::
56567::$$$message_0499_0022_0000$$$::"...You fail to understand. What did you come here to do?[lr]::
56568::$$$message_0499_0022_0001$$$::If you have come, then you must obey my Master. You should not have come alone if you intended to fight."::
56569::$$$message_0499_0023_0000$$$::"Rgh..."[lr]::
56570::$$$message_0499_0023_0001$$$::Rider's completely right.[lr]::
56571::$$$message_0499_0023_0002$$$::...I need to keep a cool head.[lr]::
56572::$$$message_0499_0023_0003$$$::Since I'm following Shinji's directions, I need to focus only on saving Sakura, not beating Shinji.::
56573::$$$message_0499_0024_0000$$$::"...Whew."[lr]::
56574::$$$message_0499_0024_0001$$$::I take a deep breath and relax.::
56575::$$$message_0499_0025_0000$$$::Holding Sakura close, Shinji enjoys my apparent dismay.[lr]::
56576::$$$message_0499_0025_0001$$$::...Sakura hangs her head, not looking up at me.[lr]::
56577::$$$message_0499_0025_0002$$$::I'm sure she isn't unconscious, right?[lr]::
56578::$$$message_0499_0025_0003$$$::She's standing on her own two legs.[lr]::
56579::$$$message_0499_0025_0004$$$::She's just looking down because she can't raise her head.::
56580::$$$message_0499_0026_0000$$$::"Shinji. Did you tell Sakura about the Holy Grail War?"[lr]::
56581::$$$message_0499_0026_0001$$$::I glare at him without hiding my anger.[lr]::
56582::$$$message_0499_0026_0002$$$::"Huh?"::
56583::$$$message_0499_0027_0000$$$::"Oh, that. So that's what you're worried about![lr]::
56584::$$$message_0499_0027_0001$$$::Relax, Emiya. You didn't tell her anything, so I explained everything, start to finish! About how we're Masters who are trying to kill each other!"::
56585::$$$message_0499_0028_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
56586::$$$message_0499_0028_0001$$$::"Were you trying to keep it a secret? Of course it'd come out, you idiot! She knew you were hiding things from her, but she didn't ask out of respect for you!"[lr]::
56587::$$$message_0499_0028_0002$$$::"Ngh!"::
56588::$$$message_0499_0029_0000$$$::Sakura turns away, gritting her teeth so that she won't look up.::
56589::$$$message_0499_0030_0000$$$::"Ask him, Sakura. Emiya can't hide anything from you now. Go on, ask anything you want!"[lr]::
56590::$$$message_0499_0030_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56591::$$$message_0499_0030_0002$$$::Sakura keeps her mouth shut.[lr]::
56592::$$$message_0499_0030_0003$$$::So she keeps staring at the floor because...::
56593::$$$message_0499_0031_0000$$$::"Hm? Why aren't you saying anything?[lr]::
56594::$$$message_0499_0031_0001$$$::Go ahead. Ask him for yourself what he thinks of you, whether he hates you as a filthy Matou woman."::
56595::$$$message_0499_0032_0000$$$::"Shinji!"[lr]::
56596::$$$message_0499_0032_0001$$$::She looks like she's apologizing to me. I can't take this anymore.::
56597::$$$message_0499_0033_0000$$$::"Enough. I'm here, like we promised. Now let Sakura go."[lr]::
56598::$$$message_0499_0033_0001$$$::"Huh? What promise? I ordered you to come.[lr]::
56599::$$$message_0499_0033_0002$$$::All I said is that I wouldn't hurt her if you came alone."[lr]::
56600::$$$message_0499_0033_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
56601::$$$message_0499_0034_0000$$$::"Don't give me that look, Emiya. I'm not a monster. I'm happy that you care enough to try and take my sister back, and I'll reward that loyalty. Once this is over, you can take Sakura home with you."::
56602::$$$message_0499_0035_0000$$$::"All right. Is that a promise?"[lr]::
56603::$$$message_0499_0035_0001$$$::"Yeah. If you do what I say, I'll let her go.[lr]::
56604::$$$message_0499_0035_0002$$$::It's a deal. I'll honor it."::
56605::$$$message_0499_0036_0000$$$::"Fine. So what are your demands? Do you want me to get on my knees?"[lr]::
56606::$$$message_0499_0036_0001$$$::"No need to go that far. Having a guy on his knees in front of me isn't a turn-on at all. I called you here to fight. I said we'd settle the score, remember?"::
56607::$$$message_0499_0037_0000$$$::Rider takes a step forward.[lr]::
56608::$$$message_0499_0037_0001$$$::She isn't exhibiting hostility or bloodlust.[lr]::
56609::$$$message_0499_0037_0002$$$::She merely advances on her Master's orders.::
56610::$$$message_0499_0038_0000$$$::"But a regular fight would be boring, y'know? It isn't fair because I'm not a mage, and we know you'd win in a fistfight.[lr]::
56611::$$$message_0499_0038_0001$$$::So let's make this fair and have you fight her."::
56612::$$$message_0499_0039_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
56613::$$$message_0499_0039_0001$$$::You've gotta be kidding me.[lr]::
56614::$$$message_0499_0039_0002$$$::He wants me, a regular person, to go up against Rider?[lr]::
56615::$$$message_0499_0039_0003$$$::He may as well ask me to kill myself.::
56616::$$$message_0499_0040_0000$$$::"Hey, you won't die, at least. I told Rider to hold back.[lr]::
56617::$$$message_0499_0040_0001$$$::It'll be annoying to have you hanging around though, so I'll have her break a few bones."::
56618::$$$message_0499_0041_0000$$$::...Rider isn't armed with her daggers.[lr]::
56619::$$$message_0499_0041_0001$$$::Apparently, she really is holding back.::
56620::$$$message_0499_0042_0000$$$::"Simple, right? Just let her beat you up.[lr]::
56621::$$$message_0499_0042_0001$$$::Oh, but don't throw in the towel right away. If you pass out before I'm satisfied, I'm taking Sakura home with me."::
56622::$$$message_0499_0043_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56623::$$$message_0499_0043_0001$$$::Rider closes in.[lr]::
56624::$$$message_0499_0043_0002$$$::In just three seconds,[lr]::
56625::$$$message_0499_0043_0003$$$::I'll be within her reach.::
56626::$$$message_0499_0044_0000$$$::"...Hmph. I'm not allowed to resist, but I can't go down easily, either?[lr]::
56627::$$$message_0499_0044_0001$$$::You're contradicting yourself, Shinji. What do you want?"::
56628::$$$message_0499_0045_0000$$$::"Isn't it obvious!?[lr]::
56629::$$$message_0499_0045_0001$$$::I just want to kick the shit out of you!!!"::
56630::$$$message_0499_0046_0000$$$::Rider pounces.[lr]::
56631::$$$message_0499_0046_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56632::$$$message_0499_0046_0002$$$::I raise my hands and brace for a beating.[lr]::
56633::$$$message_0499_0046_0003$$$::Instantly,[lr]::
56634::$$$message_0499_0046_0004$$$::a shocking impact pierces my right arm, threatening to tear off my shoulder.::
56635::$$$message_0499_0047_0000$$$::"Guh!"[lr]::
56636::$$$message_0499_0047_0001$$$::She targeted my arm which was protecting my head.[lr]::
56637::$$$message_0499_0047_0002$$$::It's still attached. Nothing's dismembered yet.[lr]::
56638::$$$message_0499_0047_0003$$$::But it's completely paralyzed, and I can't feel a thing.::
56639::$$$message_0499_0048_0000$$$::"Hah...!"[lr]::
56640::$$$message_0499_0048_0001$$$::I force myself back to my senses.[lr]::
56641::$$$message_0499_0048_0002$$$::Unarmed, I don't have a chance in hell.[lr]::
56642::$$$message_0499_0048_0003$$$::I need to Strengthen something and protect myself if I want to stay in one piece.[lr]::
56643::$$$message_0499_0048_0004$$$::The next attack will finish me if I can't at least turn my thin school uniform to iron or at least harden my defenseless body!::
56644::$$$message_0499_0049_0000$$$::"Rrgh!"[lr]::
56645::$$$message_0499_0049_0001$$$::My left arm protecting my head dips.[lr]::
56646::$$$message_0499_0049_0002$$$::The sledgehammer-like strike smashes through my Strengthened clothes and nearly breaks my limb.::
56647::$$$message_0499_0049_0003$$$::"Hah! Damn...it...!"[lr]::
56648::$$$message_0499_0049_0004$$$::In the space of a single breath, she disabled both of my arms.[lr]::
56649::$$$message_0499_0049_0005$$$::...No, I can still move them, but I can't feel anything.[lr]::
56650::$$$message_0499_0049_0006$$$::With reactions this sluggish, I can't use my arms to protect myself from Rider anymore.[lr]::
56651::$$$message_0499_0049_0007$$$::If she goes for the face next, it'll be an instant knockout!::
56652::$$$message_0499_0050_0000$$$::Rider is merciless.[lr]::
56653::$$$message_0499_0050_0001$$$::She rains down fists on me, following Shinji's orders.[lr]::
56654::$$$message_0499_0050_0002$$$::The mechanical way she does it makes her seem like a machine spinning its arms.::
56655::$$$message_0499_0051_0000$$$::"Ah! Guh!"[lr]::
56656::$$$message_0499_0051_0001$$$::With arms that can't move properly, I do my best to guard my face.[lr]::
56657::$$$message_0499_0051_0002$$$::Rider's fists were never something I could predict and block, anyway.[lr]::
56658::$$$message_0499_0051_0003$$$::I just need to focus on protecting my head so that I don't get knocked out.::
56659::$$$message_0499_0052_0000$$$::"Ngh! Kuh!"[lr]::
56660::$$$message_0499_0052_0001$$$::What is Rider thinking, I wonder?[lr]::
56661::$$$message_0499_0052_0002$$$::She doesn't go for the numerous gaps in my defense.[lr]::
56662::$$$message_0499_0052_0003$$$::All she does is keep pounding my arms and unprotected stomach.[lr]::
56663::$$$message_0499_0052_0004$$$::...The agony is enough to make me faint, but it isn't the same force that rendered my arms numb.::
56664::$$$message_0499_0053_0000$$$::"..., ..."[lr]::
56665::$$$message_0499_0053_0001$$$::...That's weird.[lr]::
56666::$$$message_0499_0053_0002$$$::I saw how strong Rider was at Ryudou Temple. She could have cut me in half, if she wanted.[lr]::
56667::$$$message_0499_0053_0003$$$::Maybe she's just holding back, like Shinji said.[lr]::
56668::$$$message_0499_0053_0004$$$::She might be avoiding my head to keep from knocking me out too early, but this still isn't like her.::
56669::$$$message_0499_0054_0000$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
56670::$$$message_0499_0054_0001$$$::In fact, she's an order of magnitude weaker.[lr]::
56671::$$$message_0499_0054_0002$$$::The raw magical energy that Servants give off is enough to make my skin crawl.::
56672::$$$message_0499_0055_0000$$$::At Ryudou Temple, Rider was a formidable Servant.[lr]::
56673::$$$message_0499_0055_0001$$$::But the Rider attacking me now is the same Rider who lost to Saber in the park.[lr]::
56674::$$$message_0499_0055_0002$$$::I don't know why that is, but this is my chance to turn the tables on Shinji!::
56675::$$$message_0499_0056_0000$$$::"Guogh, buh!"[lr]::
56676::$$$message_0499_0056_0001$$$::I stumble forward.[lr]::
56677::$$$message_0499_0056_0002$$$::Like someone tired of beating on a sandbag, Rider steps in and lays a heavy uppercut into my stomach.::
56678::$$$message_0499_0056_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56679::$$$message_0499_0056_0004$$$::It's like a pile driver, hollowing out my insides.[lr]::
56680::$$$message_0499_0056_0005$$$::...That one really hurt.[lr]::
56681::$$$message_0499_0056_0006$$$::My not-yet healed injuries from last night scream out in pain.[lr]::
56682::$$$message_0499_0056_0007$$$::The blow makes me vomit gastric juices, and I go weak at the knees.::
56683::$$$message_0499_0057_0000$$$::"Done so soon, Emiya? You gotta man up in front of Sakura. You look like a total loser!"[lr]::
56684::$$$message_0499_0057_0001$$$::I feel myself pitch forward.::
56685::$$$message_0499_0058_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56686::$$$message_0499_0058_0001$$$::Rider backs off slightly and watches me collapse.::
56687::$$$message_0499_0059_0000$$$::But, I...[lr]::
56688::$$$message_0499_0059_0001$$$::"Nnngh...aaahhh!"[lr]::
56689::$$$message_0499_0059_0002$$$::I grab Rider's arms and force myself to keep standing.::
56690::$$$message_0499_0060_0000$$$::"Ha! Nice, Emiya! You're as stubborn as a cockroach![lr]::
56691::$$$message_0499_0060_0001$$$::Ahaha, you're freakin' hilarious!"[lr]::
56692::$$$message_0499_0060_0002$$$::Argh...[lr]::
56693::$$$message_0499_0060_0003$$$::Damn, that one really got me good. I'm dizzy, and I didn't even get hit in the head.::
56694::$$$message_0499_0061_0000$$$::"Ahh, but that was a third-rate show. You're just going to keep showing me the same thing over and over. I'm getting bored, so let's wrap this up with a dramatic KO."::
56695::$$$message_0499_0062_0000$$$::    The same thing?[lr]::
56696::$$$message_0499_0062_0001$$$::You've got to be kidding.[lr]::
56697::$$$message_0499_0062_0002$$$::Our positions are completely different now.[lr]::
56698::$$$message_0499_0062_0003$$$::Can't he even tell that our positions are reversed since I pulled myself up using Rider's arms?::
56699::$$$message_0499_0063_0000$$$::"The distance is about five meters. Your endurance has won you this battle."[lr]::
56700::$$$message_0499_0063_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
56701::$$$message_0499_0063_0002$$$::I look up.[lr]::
56702::$$$message_0499_0063_0003$$$::What did Rider just say to me?::
56703::$$$message_0499_0064_0000$$$::"Break's over. Time for round two, Emiya."[lr]::
56704::$$$message_0499_0064_0001$$$::Rider shakes off my hands.[lr]::
56705::$$$message_0499_0064_0002$$$::The Servant in the black dress resumes her robotic assault.::
56706::$$$message_0499_0065_0000$$$::   I'm driven backwards.[lr]::
56707::$$$message_0499_0065_0001$$$::Each of Rider's strikes avoids any vital points that would end the fight.::
56708::$$$message_0499_0066_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56709::$$$message_0499_0066_0001$$$::I'm numb all over.[lr]::
56710::$$$message_0499_0066_0002$$$::Internal bleeding forms dark bruises where she hits me, and I can't even feel the pain anymore.[lr]::
56711::$$$message_0499_0066_0003$$$::It's because the pain lingering inside me is stronger than the external pain she's inflicting.[lr]::
56712::$$$message_0499_0066_0004$$$::Rider is mercilessly destroying my body from within.::
56713::$$$message_0499_0067_0000$$$::"Prepare yourself."[lr]::
56714::$$$message_0499_0067_0001$$$::The Servant utters emotionlessly and moves in.::
56715::$$$message_0499_0068_0000$$$::That's when I fully understand[line2][lr]::
56716::$$$message_0499_0068_0001$$$::This isn't what Shinji wants.[lr]::
56717::$$$message_0499_0068_0002$$$::She isn't avoiding aiming for my head[lr]::
56718::$$$message_0499_0068_0003$$$::or leaving me just barely mobile[lr]::
56719::$$$message_0499_0068_0004$$$::because Shinji ordered her to...::
56720::$$$message_0499_0069_0000$$$::"No need to hold back anymore! Kill him, Rider!"[lr]::
56721::$$$message_0499_0069_0001$$$::"...!? Shinji, stop...!"::
56722::$$$message_0499_0070_0000$$$::Rider takes a step forward, her long hair dancing through the air.[lr]::
56723::$$$message_0499_0070_0001$$$::Then, she hits me with a thrust to the chest unlike anything I've experienced so far.::
56724::$$$message_0499_0071_0000$$$::"GUH[line2]"[lr]::
56725::$$$message_0499_0071_0001$$$::I can't breathe.[lr]::
56726::$$$message_0499_0071_0002$$$::My feet leave the ground.[lr]::
56727::$$$message_0499_0071_0003$$$::I nearly black out from the punch, even though I saw it coming.::
56728::$$$message_0499_0072_0000$$$::"Senpai!"::
56729::$$$message_0499_0073_0000$$$::Rider sends me flying. As I sail through the air, I hear a muffled scream and a delighted guffaw.[lr]::
56730::$$$message_0499_0073_0001$$$::...Sakura's voice is much closer now.::
56731::$$$message_0499_0074_0000$$$::   I fall.[lr]::
56732::$$$message_0499_0074_0001$$$::On any other day, I would be dead as soon as I hit the floor.[lr]::
56733::$$$message_0499_0074_0002$$$::She wouldn't even need the impact of the fall to kill me.[lr]::
56734::$$$message_0499_0074_0003$$$::It's an attack that sent a whole human being flying.[lr]::
56735::$$$message_0499_0074_0004$$$::I'd expect it to punch a gaping hole through my chest on impact.::
56736::$$$message_0499_0075_0000$$$::"...Hah."[lr]::
56737::$$$message_0499_0075_0001$$$::But I'm still alive.[lr]::
56738::$$$message_0499_0075_0002$$$::She went out of her way to time the punch so perfectly, anyone could've jumped back at the same time.[lr]::
56739::$$$message_0499_0075_0003$$$::That attack wasn't meant to kill me.[lr]::
56740::$$$message_0499_0075_0004$$$::Ultimately, it was Rider, not Shinji, who decided to avoid hitting me in the face and keep attacking me in a way that allowed me to keep moving.::
56741::$$$message_0499_0076_0000$$$::"Here goes..."[lr]::
56742::$$$message_0499_0076_0001$$$::I'm at a perfect distance.[lr]::
56743::$$$message_0499_0076_0002$$$::Just before I hit the ground, I twist my body in midair, and...::
56744::$$$message_0499_0077_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
56745::$$$message_0499_0077_0001$$$::...grab the knife blade in front of me with my left hand.::
56746::$$$message_0499_0078_0000$$$::My left palm wraps around the blade.[lr]::
56747::$$$message_0499_0078_0001$$$::It's already numb, so the sensation of metal cutting flesh doesn't bother me.::
56748::$$$message_0499_0079_0000$$$::"Eh? Wha!?"[lr]::
56749::$$$message_0499_0079_0001$$$::I bring my right arm around in a wild swing.[lr]::
56750::$$$message_0499_0079_0002$$$::Paying no heed to my left hand being sliced open,[lr]::
56751::$$$message_0499_0079_0003$$$::I slug Shinji squarely in the face with my clenched right fist.::
