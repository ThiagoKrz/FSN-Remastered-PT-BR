14243::$$$message_0134_0000_0000$$$::Hellooo! I don't think I need to remind you all, but this Tiger Dojo, the place that offers relief to those suffering from bad ends... Your oasis in a scorching desert.::
14244::$$$message_0134_0000_0001$$$::This time we're celebrating lucky number seven!::
14245::$$$message_0134_0000_0002$$$::And it's the monumental episode where Shirou finally became mine![lr]::
14246::$$$message_0134_0000_0003$$$::A round of applause please, everyone!::
14247::$$$message_0134_0000_0004$$$::Yay! Congrats, Illya!::
14248::$$$message_0134_0000_0005$$$::Hey! Who would celebrate that, you damn devil child!?::
14249::$$$message_0134_0000_0006$$$::Honestly! What happened to all that talk from last time about you getting depressed because you were always having to be the guide leading Shirou into hell!?::
14250::$$$message_0134_0000_0007$$$::Huh? But Shirou said it was okay on his own this time. It's not my fault.::
14251::$$$message_0134_0000_0008$$$::And I bet Shirou is happy. From now on, Shirou, me, Sella, and Liz can live together, happily ever after.::
14252::$$$message_0134_0000_0009$$$::Hm. When you put it that way, it sounds like paradise.[lr]::
14253::$$$message_0134_0000_0010$$$::Well, it certainly sounds delightful to be with a princess who's barely reached maturity.::
14254::$$$message_0134_0000_0011$$$::Yep. It's a gift neither Taiga, Rin, nor Sakura have... It's my privilege, and mine alone!::
14255::$$$message_0134_0000_0012$$$::And so, Shirou is going to spend the rest of his life in this depraved honeymoon with me!::
14256::$$$message_0134_0000_0013$$$::Uh, long story short, that whole segment got axed.::
14257::$$$message_0134_0000_0014$$$::Ugh...Senpai, that really hurts. You promised not to mention that.::
14258::$$$message_0134_0000_0015$$$::Quit being so arrogant, Gym Shorts.::
14259::$$$message_0134_0000_0016$$$::Hey, you there! Don't bully my first disciple!::
14260::$$$message_0134_0000_0017$$$::Ack...she got away again... Hey, what even is that thing!?[lr]::
14261::$$$message_0134_0000_0018$$$::Oh, are you okay, Illya?::
14262::$$$message_0134_0000_0019$$$::Yes, ma'am! Those words just got me all hyped up! My senior's words are always so profound!::
14263::$$$message_0134_0000_0020$$$::...I have a feeling they've formed a bond much deeper than with her mentor here...[lr]::
14264::$$$message_0134_0000_0021$$$::Oh, by the way, Disciple Number One, you keep saying you'll make dolls out of people. Don't tell me that doll... No, it can't be…::
14265::$$$message_0134_0000_0022$$$::Oh. You don't like scary stories, Taiga? Or do you enjoy stories about dolls coming alive?::
14266::$$$message_0134_0000_0023$$$::Well anyway, this episode of Tiger Dojo's finished!::
14267::$$$message_0134_0000_0024$$$::You made the wrong choice again, so go back to the previous scene and do it over!::
14268::$$$message_0134_0000_0025$$$::Oh, you're trying to change the subject, Mentor! I really think you should listen to what your disciple has to say!::
14269::$$$message_0134_0000_0026$$$::I shall not! I hate scary stories AND horse racing stories!::
14270::$$$message_0134_0000_0027$$$::Oh, come on. It'll be fine. This is just a stuffed animal.::
14271::$$$message_0134_0000_0028$$$::The doll thing will come up again later, so I'll explain it then.::
14272::$$$message_0134_0000_0029$$$::Be patient until then, and keep Saber and Rin company!::
