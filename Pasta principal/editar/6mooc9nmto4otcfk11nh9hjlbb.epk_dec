36853::$$$message_0311_0000_0000$$$::"Oh yeah. I need to tell Tohsaka that Issei is innocent before she attacks him."[lr]::
36854::$$$message_0311_0000_0001$$$::I should hurry.[lr]::
36855::$$$message_0311_0000_0002$$$::Before their relationship suffers beyond repair, I have to let my hot-headed partner know.::
36856::$$$message_0311_0001_0000$$$::"Huh? Tohsaka left a while ago."[lr]::
36857::$$$message_0311_0001_0001$$$::Then...[lr]::
36858::$$$message_0311_0001_0002$$$::After searching everywhere else first, I stopped once more at classroom 2-A, where the final blow was dealt.::
36859::$$$message_0311_0002_0000$$$::"This sucks... She was so punchy earlier yet she went home already..."[lr]::
36860::$$$message_0311_0002_0001$$$::...This is starting to feel stupid.[lr]::
36861::$$$message_0311_0002_0002$$$::I can just call her once I get home...::
36862::$$$message_0311_0003_0000$$$::I check the school directory as soon as I get home and call Tohsaka's.[lr]::
36863::$$$message_0311_0003_0001$$$::The phone rings.[lr]::
36864::$$$message_0311_0003_0002$$$::After calling dozens of times, right before I'm ready to give up, she picks up.::
36865::$$$message_0311_0004_0000$$$::"Yes, this is Tohsaka."[lr]::
36866::$$$message_0311_0004_0001$$$::The voice on the other end is definitely Tohsaka's.::
36867::$$$message_0311_0005_0000$$$::"Hello? It's Emiya. Do you have time right now?"[lr]::
36868::$$$message_0311_0005_0001$$$::"Huh? Stop fooling around, Ar[line2]Wait, no way, is it actually you...!?"[lr]::
36869::$$$message_0311_0005_0002$$$::"...Hey. I don't have the free time to be playing around with you."::
36870::$$$message_0311_0006_0000$$$::"Oh... No, that's not it... Sorry, I was just a little surprised. Did something happen for you to call?"::
36871::$$$message_0311_0007_0000$$$::"It's about Issei. I promised you that I would get it cleared up today. Issei wasn't a Master. He didn't have a Command Spell anywhere, so there's no doubt."::
36872::$$$message_0311_0008_0000$$$::"Really? ...I'm surprised that you actually looked into it today. So Issei is innocent, huh? ...Well, we're out of leads now, but I guess that's fine."[lr]::
36873::$$$message_0311_0008_0001$$$::I can't tell whether she's disappointed or relieved. I can't grasp Tohsaka's reaction that well through the phone.::
36874::$$$message_0311_0009_0000$$$::"Anyway, good work. We'll think about what to do about the search for the Master tomorrow. So is that all? If so, I have to go."[lr]::
36875::$$$message_0311_0009_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
36876::$$$message_0311_0009_0002$$$::I don't have anything else to say.[lr]::
36877::$$$message_0311_0009_0003$$$::But, there is one other thing that bothers me.::
36878::$$$message_0311_0010_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. You seemed surprised earlier. Did something happen?"[lr]::
36879::$$$message_0311_0010_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36880::$$$message_0311_0010_0002$$$::I can feel Tohsaka's bewilderment through the phone.[lr]::
36881::$$$message_0311_0010_0003$$$::After a brief moment of silence...::
36882::$$$message_0311_0011_0000$$$::"...Nothing. I just got surprised since your voice just sounded a bit different over the phone."[lr]::
36883::$$$message_0311_0011_0001$$$::She states the obvious in a cold voice and hangs up.::â,
