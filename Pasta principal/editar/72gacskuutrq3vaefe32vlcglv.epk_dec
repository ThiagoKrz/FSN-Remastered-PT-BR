67435::$$$message_0627_0000_0000$$$::   As an aside[line2][lr]::
67436::$$$message_0627_0000_0001$$$::   It is a misconception to say that a priest's duty is exorcism.::
67437::$$$message_0627_0001_0000$$$::Priests deliver the word of God. They do not drive out demons.[lr]::
67438::$$$message_0627_0001_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Their[font italic=false] god is one and absolute. He resides in all, and is the greatest of all. He is the Holy Spirit who created a perfect world.[lr]::
67439::$$$message_0627_0001_0002$$$::He would never allow any evil to corrupt His children and dirty His creations.::
67440::$$$message_0627_0002_0000$$$::But some evils are tenacious in their corruption of man and tainting of the earth.[lr]::
67441::$$$message_0627_0002_0001$$$::There are things which should not exist, profaning this world.[lr]::
67442::$$$message_0627_0002_0002$$$::They reconciled this seeming contradiction thus: [lr]::
67443::$$$message_0627_0002_0003$$$::Even the demons which threaten man are necessary pieces of the world the Lord created. They are creatures worthy of His love.::
67444::$$$message_0627_0003_0000$$$::According to this dogma, demons serve the will of Heaven.[lr]::
67445::$$$message_0627_0003_0001$$$::If the divine cultivates man's goodness, then the demonic forges man's evil nature.[lr]::
67446::$$$message_0627_0003_0002$$$::They both serve Heaven's will.[lr]::
67447::$$$message_0627_0003_0003$$$::A priest who preaches the Lord's word has no authority to destroy demons.::
67448::$$$message_0627_0004_0000$$$::And yet...[lr]::
67449::$$$message_0627_0004_0001$$$::To reiterate, some demons are particularly tenacious in their corruption of man and tainting of the earth. They wreak ghastly tragedies beyond human comprehension.[lr]::
67450::$$$message_0627_0004_0002$$$::In time, His children mistook heavenly designs for powerlessness.[lr]::
67451::$$$message_0627_0004_0003$$$::They sought miracles from the Lord to stop the evils they could not understand.::
67452::$$$message_0627_0005_0000$$$::Thus, exceptions were created...[lr]::
67453::$$$message_0627_0005_0001$$$::Human apostles who do not preach the Lord's word, but instead execute His will.[lr]::
67454::$$$message_0627_0005_0002$$$::Trials originally meant to be witnessed[line2][lr]::
67455::$$$message_0627_0005_0003$$$::Heresies originally meant to be denied[line2][lr]::
67456::$$$message_0627_0005_0004$$$::Those who receive the Eighth Sacrament, which originally did not exist[line2][lr]::
67457::$$$message_0627_0005_0005$$$::The one hundred and twenty cardinals ordered the creation of the Executors, destroyers of evil.::
67458::$$$message_0627_0006_0000$$$::They drive out evil and eliminate that which does not exist in the Lord's gospel.[lr]::
67459::$$$message_0627_0006_0001$$$::Those who hunt the faithless are themselves unbound by faith.[lr]::
67460::$$$message_0627_0006_0002$$$::One could conclude that they are permitted to be "immoral."[lr]::
67461::$$$message_0627_0006_0003$$$::They are charged to protect only one thing: the name of the Lord Almighty.[lr]::
67462::$$$message_0627_0006_0004$$$::For that cause, they will even destroy the evils He created.[lr]::
67463::$$$message_0627_0006_0005$$$::That is the only thing they have in common with exorcists.::
67464::$$$message_0627_0007_0000$$$::"...An Executor. I have heard that the Church teaches them to be as flighty as a dove yet as treacherous as a snake... And that you are no exception."[lr]::
67465::$$$message_0627_0007_0001$$$::The white mask sneers.[lr]::
67466::$$$message_0627_0007_0002$$$::Kirei Kotomine does not answer. He checks his weapons.::
67467::$$$message_0627_0008_0000$$$::He has five Black Keys of Confession for each hand, and his left arm contains several unused Command Spells from the previous war.[lr]::
67468::$$$message_0627_0008_0001$$$::He is more than well-armed against lesser spirits.[lr]::
67469::$$$message_0627_0008_0002$$$::But he lacks the firepower to fully defeat a Servant, even if all of his blades were to strike true.[lr]::
67470::$$$message_0627_0008_0003$$$::Assassin is still a Heroic Spirit, albeit a nameless one.[lr]::
67471::$$$message_0627_0008_0004$$$::It would be impossible to defeat him without the Scriptures carried by a select few Executors.::
67472::$$$message_0627_0009_0000$$$::"What's wrong? I see that you possess throwing weapons as well. Shall we have a contest?"[lr]::
67473::$$$message_0627_0009_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67474::$$$message_0627_0009_0002$$$::The priest doesn't move.[lr]::
67475::$$$message_0627_0009_0003$$$::He listens keenly to the sounds of the forest while watching the skull lurking between the trees.[lr]::
67476::$$$message_0627_0009_0004$$$::The rustling of leaves.[lr]::
67477::$$$message_0627_0009_0005$$$::The breathing beneath the mask.[lr]::
67478::$$$message_0627_0009_0006$$$::The rippling of flesh.[lr]::
67479::$$$message_0627_0009_0007$$$::And the fading footsteps of the made warrior.::
67480::$$$message_0627_0010_0000$$$::"...So it's gone that way. You must be having trouble with Sakura Matou, Zouken Makiri."[lr]::
67481::$$$message_0627_0010_0001$$$::He makes an observation, his eyes fixed on the skull.::
67482::$$$message_0627_0011_0000$$$::"Ha. Haha. Hahahahahaha![lr]::
67483::$$$message_0627_0011_0001$$$::So you noticed me, Kirei![lr]::
67484::$$$message_0627_0011_0002$$$::Why did you stop if you know so much? Before you would have fed that boy to the dogs and run.[lr]::
67485::$$$message_0627_0011_0003$$$::And now you graciously offer yourself up as bait! How very unlike you. Don't tell me you've been overcome by a sudden episode of compassion!"::
67486::$$$message_0627_0012_0000$$$::His laughter echoes through the forest.[lr]::
67487::$$$message_0627_0012_0001$$$::The white skull sways slightly.[lr]::
67488::$$$message_0627_0012_0002$$$::The priest doesn't even twitch an eyebrow.[lr]::
67489::$$$message_0627_0012_0003$$$::"I had no intention of helping Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
67490::$$$message_0627_0012_0004$$$::I simply have business with you."[lr]::
67491::$$$message_0627_0012_0005$$$::Kotomine speaks to the invisible mage without even showing his bloodlust.::
67492::$$$message_0627_0013_0000$$$::"Oh? Business with me, you say?"[lr]::
67493::$$$message_0627_0013_0001$$$::"Of course. Neither Shirou Emiya nor I will escape this forest, at any rate. I know that we will be killed soon.[lr]::
67494::$$$message_0627_0013_0002$$$::It only stands to reason that I would try to achieve my own goal before I die."[lr]::
67495::$$$message_0627_0013_0003$$$::"Hm? So you mean you don't care what happens to Illyasviel? I thought you came to save her."::
67496::$$$message_0627_0014_0000$$$::"I don't care. Even if I defeated Assassin here and went to help Shirou Emiya, I would be too late. It is of no concern to me whether or not he saves the girl."[lr]::
67497::$$$message_0627_0014_0001$$$::His left hand holds three Black Keys.[lr]::
67498::$$$message_0627_0014_0002$$$::The priest watches the skull in front of him, holding the swords in a fan shape.::
67499::$$$message_0627_0015_0000$$$::"...Oh? So you stayed here deliberately?"[lr]::
67500::$$$message_0627_0015_0001$$$::"Yes. I'm thinking that I should either prevent Illya from being handed over to you..."[lr]::
67501::$$$message_0627_0015_0002$$$::Bloodlust disappears.[lr]::
67502::$$$message_0627_0015_0003$$$::The white mask camouflages him among the trees and completely vanishes from sight.::
67503::$$$message_0627_0016_0000$$$::"...or kill you where you stand."::
67504::$$$message_0627_0017_0000$$$::Blades streak through the air.[lr]::
67505::$$$message_0627_0017_0001$$$::The priest's thrust clashes against Assassin's thrown dagger!::
67506::$$$message_0627_0018_0000$$$::"Kuh, haha, hahahahahahahaha![lr]::
67507::$$$message_0627_0018_0001$$$::So that's what you came here to die for! Very well, Kirei. For old times' sake, let us see how well a reject from the Church can fight!"[lr]::
67508::$$$message_0627_0018_0002$$$::His cackling rings through the forest.[lr]::
67509::$$$message_0627_0018_0003$$$::Knowing he can't win, the clergyman who only drives out evil faces down the Malak al-Maut whom the old mage controls...::
67510::$$$message_0627_0019_0000$$$::"Hah... haah, haah, haah, ha...!"::
67511::$$$message_0627_0020_0000$$$::I run through the forest, carrying Illya.[lr]::
67512::$$$message_0627_0020_0001$$$::I can't look back.[lr]::
67513::$$$message_0627_0020_0002$$$::The second I do, I'll be too conscious of the giant black wall and lose hope.[lr]::
67514::$$$message_0627_0020_0003$$$::I can't afford to do that.[lr]::
67515::$$$message_0627_0020_0004$$$::If my spirit dulls for even a bit, it'll catch up.[lr]::
67516::$$$message_0627_0020_0005$$$::It'll catch me and Illya, and kill us.::

67618::$$$message_0627_0053_0001$$$::But I can still move.[lr]::
67619::$$$message_0627_0053_0002$$$::If I have one minute to breathe, I can run.[lr]::
67620::$$$message_0627_0053_0003$$$::I muster all of my Magic Circuits to drive my body...::
67621::$$$message_0627_0054_0000$$$::"Hey, what's wrong, Berserker? Don't you recognize me?"[lr]::
67622::$$$message_0627_0054_0001$$$::Illya looks like she's been entranced by the dark foe.[lr]::
67623::$$$message_0627_0054_0002$$$::In her shock, she keeps whimpering in denial at the changed thing before her.::
67624::$$$message_0627_0055_0000$$$::...She's fixated on the dark enemy's identity.[lr]::
67625::$$$message_0627_0055_0001$$$::Kotomine said that it can't see.[lr]::
67626::$$$message_0627_0055_0002$$$::He was right, but not right.::
67627::$$$message_0627_0056_0000$$$::The Servant has no eyes, nose, or mouth anymore.[lr]::
67628::$$$message_0627_0056_0001$$$::Its gleaming red eye sockets give off only bloodlust.[lr]::
67629::$$$message_0627_0056_0002$$$::Its entire body is corroded by the black mud, and the wound that Saber inflicted is still there.::
67630::$$$message_0627_0057_0000$$$::...It's something different, now.[lr]::
67631::$$$message_0627_0057_0001$$$::Swallowed by the Shadow, it's now a monster whose only purpose is destruction.[lr]::
67632::$$$message_0627_0057_0002$$$::It can't see what it's chasing.[lr]::
67633::$$$message_0627_0057_0003$$$::The dark Berserker's eyeballs don't see Illya, never mind me.::
67634::$$$message_0627_0058_0000$$$::"[wacky len=14]"[lr]::
67635::$$$message_0627_0058_0001$$$::It roars and raises its axe-sword over the creature in front of it.::
67636::$$$message_0627_0059_0000$$$::The priest faces his final moments.[lr]::
67637::$$$message_0627_0059_0001$$$::"Fuh... phew... fuhh..."[lr]::
67638::$$$message_0627_0059_0002$$$::Kirei Kotomine leans against a wall, staring at the blurry skull in front of him.[lr]::
67639::$$$message_0627_0059_0003$$$::His vestments are battered and torn.[lr]::
67640::$$$message_0627_0059_0004$$$::His breathing is labored, and he is down to his last three Black Keys.::
67641::$$$message_0627_0060_0000$$$::"Hahaha. This is checkmate. Perhaps I should praise you for holding your own against a Servant for so long."[lr]::
67642::$$$message_0627_0060_0001$$$::The old man's chuckle echoes overhead.::
67643::$$$message_0627_0061_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67644::$$$message_0627_0061_0001$$$::Assassin is silent, unlike his talkative Master.[lr]::
67645::$$$message_0627_0061_0002$$$::To him, combat is work.[lr]::
67646::$$$message_0627_0061_0003$$$::The dirks he aims at his target's vitals are also meant to gauge his prey's strength.[lr]::
67647::$$$message_0627_0061_0004$$$::When the prey defends against the first dagger, that tells him its mobility.[lr]::
67648::$$$message_0627_0061_0005$$$::The second dagger reveals its mindset.[lr]::
67649::$$$message_0627_0061_0006$$$::He maintains a distance of seven meters.[lr]::
67650::$$$message_0627_0061_0007$$$::The killer keeps his target at a distance where only thrown weapons are effective, in order to measure its abilities.::
67651::$$$message_0627_0062_0000$$$::If he can't slay it in one blow, then he chases it to a position where that's possible.[lr]::
67652::$$$message_0627_0062_0001$$$::He cripples its limbs, wears out its stamina, and drives it to the point of heart failure.[lr]::
67653::$$$message_0627_0062_0002$$$::To Assassin, his daggers are merely steps to ensure a certain death.[lr]::
67654::$$$message_0627_0062_0003$$$::He uses the daggers to measure his prey's strength, forces it into a prime opportunity for a kill, and then finishes it off with his devil's arm.[lr]::
67655::$$$message_0627_0062_0004$$$::It is his work, and a lifestyle that brings him no pleasure.::
67656::$$$message_0627_0063_0000$$$::While the work is dull, the priest proved to be an unexpectedly intriguing mark.[lr]::
67657::$$$message_0627_0063_0001$$$::He has already used over twenty daggers.[lr]::
67658::$$$message_0627_0063_0002$$$::The daggers were thrown to gauge his opponent, but every strike was lethal.[lr]::
67659::$$$message_0627_0063_0003$$$::The priest broke out of the forest while fending off his attacks, arriving at these ruins.[lr]::
67660::$$$message_0627_0063_0004$$$::Assassin had dismissed him as a mere mortal, but the priest's skills are worthy of admiration.::
67661::$$$message_0627_0064_0000$$$::"Whew... fuhh...fuh..."[lr]::
67662::$$$message_0627_0064_0001$$$::But this is the end.[lr]::
67663::$$$message_0627_0064_0002$$$::The priest has no more strength left to run. His back is to a wall, and all he can do is watch Assassin.[lr]::
67664::$$$message_0627_0064_0003$$$::He has three Black Keys still concealed.[lr]::
67665::$$$message_0627_0064_0004$$$::Assassin dodged all seven of the Black Keys he threw like bullets, and the weapons vanished into the woods.::
67666::$$$message_0627_0065_0000$$$::"Time to bring this to a close. Put him out of his misery, Assassin."[lr]::
67667::$$$message_0627_0065_0001$$$::The skull shakes.[lr]::
67668::$$$message_0627_0065_0002$$$::Assassin throws daggers without making any visible motions.[lr]::
67669::$$$message_0627_0065_0003$$$::He targets the forehead, pancreas, and diaphragm.[lr]::
67670::$$$message_0627_0065_0004$$$::Simultaneously, the priest defends against the unleashed lightning with the Black Keys in his hand.::
67671::$$$message_0627_0066_0000$$$::It is a forgone conclusion.[lr]::
67672::$$$message_0627_0066_0001$$$::A throwing technique which, once unleashed, [lr]::
67673::$$$message_0627_0066_0002$$$::is certain to spell victory.[lr]::
67674::$$$message_0627_0066_0003$$$::The three vital point attacks are a feint.[lr]::
67675::$$$message_0627_0066_0004$$$::Once Kirei Kotomine parried the daggers, his fate was sealed.::
67676::$$$message_0627_0067_0000$$$::"Die."[lr]::
67677::$$$message_0627_0067_0001$$$::A wing flutters open.[lr]::
67678::$$$message_0627_0067_0002$$$::Assassin's long, cursed arm unfolds like a one-winged spear.[lr]::
67679::$$$message_0627_0067_0003$$$::   It is an unavoidable attack.[lr]::
67680::$$$message_0627_0067_0004$$$::Assassin knows the priest's movements.[lr]::
67681::$$$message_0627_0067_0005$$$::He has a firm understanding of his tired, bloodied prey's abilities.::
67682::$$$message_0627_0068_0000$$$::   Thus, it is inevitable.[lr]::
67683::$$$message_0627_0068_0001$$$::The prey may have avoided getting killed by the dirks.[lr]::
67684::$$$message_0627_0068_0002$$$::But his life ends there.[lr]::
67685::$$$message_0627_0068_0003$$$::Even if he had some strength in reserve, the priest's body cannot keep up with his thoughts.::
67686::$$$message_0627_0069_0000$$$::The three daggers he parried left him no choice but to jump to the side.[lr]::
67687::$$$message_0627_0069_0001$$$::He has no way to escape this arm from four meters away...!::
67688::$$$message_0627_0070_0000$$$::    The devil's arm extends.[lr]::
67689::$$$message_0627_0070_0001$$$::The priest shows no fear.[lr]::
67690::$$$message_0627_0070_0002$$$::He was prepared for this.[lr]::
67691::$$$message_0627_0070_0003$$$::He anticipated everything[line2]the feint, the attack from the cursed arm as he defended himself, and the lack of any avenue of escape.::
67692::$$$message_0627_0071_0000$$$::Yes, this outcome was inevitable, no matter how much he struggled.[lr]::
67693::$$$message_0627_0071_0001$$$::That is why...[lr]::
67694::$$$message_0627_0071_0002$$$::"[font italic=true]Set. (Hear me.)[font italic=false]"[lr]::
67695::$$$message_0627_0071_0003$$$::...his last resort is to sacrifice himself in a simultaneous strike!::
67696::$$$message_0627_0072_0000$$$::"...Fuh."[lr]::
67697::$$$message_0627_0072_0001$$$::The skull chuckles.[lr]::
67698::$$$message_0627_0072_0002$$$::In reaching for the priest's heart, the devil's arm crosses[lr]::
67699::$$$message_0627_0072_0003$$$::paths with the Black Keys.[lr]::
67700::$$$message_0627_0072_0004$$$::That is not a problem.[lr]::
67701::$$$message_0627_0072_0005$$$::Only Assassin's arm took any damage.::
67702::$$$message_0627_0073_0000$$$::He learns that Black Keys can still strike him even at this range.[lr]::
67703::$$$message_0627_0073_0001$$$::But too bad for the priest. Even if they are imbued with magical effects, his Black Keys cannot defeat Assassin.[lr]::
67704::$$$message_0627_0073_0002$$$::The three thin swords will probably pierce Assassin and nail him to the tree behind him.[lr]::
67705::$$$message_0627_0073_0003$$$::But that's all.[lr]::
67706::$$$message_0627_0073_0004$$$::While the priest celebrates the fact that he finally wounded Assassin, he will die when Assassin crushes his heart...!::
67707::$$$message_0627_0074_0000$$$::Assassin's arm finishes its work first.[lr]::
67708::$$$message_0627_0074_0001$$$::His Noble Phantasm, Zabaniya, positively touched the priest's chest and created a false heart.[lr]::
67709::$$$message_0627_0074_0002$$$::But it doesn't feel like it worked.[lr]::
67710::$$$message_0627_0074_0003$$$::The man's heart is empty. It doesn't react.::
67711::$$$message_0627_0075_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
67712::$$$message_0627_0075_0001$$$::Suddenly, an explosive impact rattles him.[lr]::
67713::$$$message_0627_0075_0002$$$::The three Black Keys slam Assassin into a tree and nail his cloak to it.[lr]::
67714::$$$message_0627_0075_0003$$$::"Neeeeeeeehhhh!?"[lr]::
67715::$$$message_0627_0075_0004$$$::He's astonished for two reasons.[lr]::
67716::$$$message_0627_0075_0005$$$::First: the Black Keys have stopped him from moving.[lr]::
67717::$$$message_0627_0075_0006$$$::And second: ::
67718::$$$message_0627_0076_0000$$$::"I-impossible! Why aren't you dead, Kirei!?"[lr]::
67719::$$$message_0627_0076_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67720::$$$message_0627_0076_0002$$$::The priest's coat flutters.[lr]::
67721::$$$message_0627_0076_0003$$$::He jumps.[lr]::
67722::$$$message_0627_0076_0004$$$::It's a comically high jump, like a human cannonball.[lr]::
67723::$$$message_0627_0076_0005$$$::He stored and stored his strength until he let it all out, performing a superhuman feat that instantly reduces ten meters to zero.[lr]::
67724::$$$message_0627_0076_0006$$$::High above the lush trees,[lr]::
67725::$$$message_0627_0076_0007$$$::his hand closes around the head of Zouken Matou, who had been enjoying the would-be execution.::
67726::$$$message_0627_0077_0000$$$::"Nngh... A-Assassin, what are you doing!?"[lr]::
67727::$$$message_0627_0077_0001$$$::That much is obvious.[lr]::
67728::$$$message_0627_0077_0002$$$::His bodyguard has been pinned to a tree by three Black Keys.[lr]::
67729::$$$message_0627_0077_0003$$$::While they only inflicted flesh wounds on Assassin,[lr]::
67730::$$$message_0627_0077_0004$$$::the blessed stakes also make it impossible for him to rescue the old man.::
67731::$$$message_0627_0078_0000$$$::"I kill. I give life. I harm and I heal. None shall escape my reach. None are beyond my sight."::
67732::$$$message_0627_0079_0000$$$::Why did he challenge an enemy he knows he can't beat?[lr]::
67733::$$$message_0627_0079_0001$$$::Was this always his objective from the beginning?::
67734::$$$message_0627_0080_0000$$$::"D-damn you. Damn you, damn you!"[lr]::
67735::$$$message_0627_0080_0001$$$::"Be silent. You'll bite your tongue."[lr]::
67736::$$$message_0627_0080_0002$$$::The priest takes hold of the old man's head and slams it into the ground.::
67737::$$$message_0627_0081_0000$$$::"Geeeehhhh!"::
67738::$$$message_0627_0082_0000$$$::"Be crushed to pieces.[lr]::
67739::$$$message_0627_0082_0001$$$::I welcome the defeated and the old. Yield to me. Learn from me. Obey me.[lr]::
67740::$$$message_0627_0082_0002$$$::Take succor. Do not forget to sing. Do not forget to pray. Do not forget me. I am light, and I shall make you forget all your burdens."::
67741::$$$message_0627_0083_0000$$$::He is merciless.[lr]::
67742::$$$message_0627_0083_0001$$$::Kotomine slams the old mage's body into the ground, crushing his bones. Then, he smashes his skull against a wall.::
67743::$$$message_0627_0084_0000$$$::"Ha...you would kill me! Fine, do as you please! But what will it change? Do you think your wish will be granted!?"::
67744::$$$message_0627_0085_0000$$$::"Make no pretenses.[lr]::
67745::$$$message_0627_0085_0001$$$::Let there be vengeance in forgiveness, betrayal in trust, despair in hope, darkness in light, death in life."::
67746::$$$message_0627_0086_0000$$$::He walks,[lr]::
67747::$$$message_0627_0086_0001$$$::marking the wall with a trail of the old man's blood.::
67748::$$$message_0627_0087_0000$$$::"Hahaha, hahahahaha! What a hopeless man you are. You still seek human blessings!? I thought you understood that such things will never come to you!"::
67749::$$$message_0627_0088_0000$$$::Kotomine grinds a mural of flesh and blood into the wall.[lr]::
67750::$$$message_0627_0088_0001$$$::All that is left of the old mage's body is his head.[lr]::
67751::$$$message_0627_0088_0002$$$::Bit by bit, it is filed away.[lr]::
67752::$$$message_0627_0088_0003$$$::Less than half of his head remains.[lr]::
67753::$$$message_0627_0088_0004$$$::As his brains are squished into paste, the old mage cackles one last time.::
67754::$$$message_0627_0089_0000$$$::                 "Seek succor in my hands. Let your sins be anointed and marked.[lr]::
67755::$$$message_0627_0089_0001$$$::                 In death, you shall gain eternal life.[lr]::
67756::$$$message_0627_0089_0002$$$::                 Here lies forgiveness. To my self given flesh, I swear thus."::
67757::$$$message_0627_0090_0000$$$::"Yes, there will be no eternity for you. Oh, Kirei, you were flawed from the moment you were born. Go on and play spectator while you fail to melt into the logic of the world!"::
67758::$$$message_0627_0091_0000$$$::                              "Kyrie, eleison. (Lord, have mercy on this soul.)"::
67759::$$$message_0627_0092_0000$$$::    The cackling fades.[lr]::
67760::$$$message_0627_0092_0001$$$::A weight and a shape, imperceptible to the human eye, fades into nothingness.::
67761::$$$message_0627_0092_0002$$$::Baptism Rites.[lr]::
67762::$$$message_0627_0092_0003$$$::The Church fixed its scriptures, the words of their god, into a system. Within that magecraft foundation, Baptism Rites are said to be the most powerful tool against spirits.[lr]::
67763::$$$message_0627_0092_0004$$$::When souls are cut off from their bodies, becoming lost and crazed, these keys of Providence return them to the void.[lr]::
