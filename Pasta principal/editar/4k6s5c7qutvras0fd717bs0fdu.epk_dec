59034::$$$message_0530_0000_0000$$$::Once school ends, I quickly start to head home.[lr]::
59035::$$$message_0530_0000_0001$$$::Since all after-school club activities are suspended, students crowd around the campus gate.[lr]::
59036::$$$message_0530_0000_0002$$$::I take a cursory look around, and don't see anyone who might be Tohsaka.[lr]::
59037::$$$message_0530_0000_0003$$$::Knowing her, she must have gone straight to the Matou house.::
59038::$$$message_0530_0001_0000$$$::"Senpai? Are you trying to find someone?"[lr]::
59039::$$$message_0530_0001_0001$$$::"Hm? Nah, I was just looking around. It's not every day you see this many students leaving at the same time."::
59040::$$$message_0530_0002_0000$$$::"Yes. But thanks to that, we can go home together today. Should we do some shopping before we head back?"[lr]::
59041::$$$message_0530_0002_0001$$$::"Yeah, let's pick up some stuff for dinner. Fuji-nee won't be coming over for a while, so we'll get enough for three: you, me, and Saber."::
59042::$$$message_0530_0003_0000$$$::After we buy groceries, we take the long way home, passing by the park.[lr]::
59043::$$$message_0530_0003_0001$$$::The park is empty.[lr]::
59044::$$$message_0530_0003_0002$$$::There aren't any kids in the playground, nor a silver-haired girl in a coat.::
59045::$$$message_0530_0004_0000$$$::"...The park is empty. Do people not come here often?"::
59046::$$$message_0530_0005_0000$$$::"Not lately, I think. When I was a kid, there would usually be someone here during the day, but these days it's pretty much like this except on days off."[lr]::
59047::$$$message_0530_0005_0001$$$::"I see. It feels kind of lonely."::
59048::$$$message_0530_0006_0000$$$::I nod in agreement and look up.[lr]::
59049::$$$message_0530_0006_0001$$$::The sky is tinged twilight.[lr]::
59050::$$$message_0530_0006_0002$$$::It's a dark red expanse with no birds in sight. It feels lonely, just like the small park.::
59051::$$$message_0530_0007_0000$$$::"Wanna head back? We should take the chance to relax at home."[lr]::
59052::$$$message_0530_0007_0001$$$::We leave the park.[lr]::
59053::$$$message_0530_0007_0002$$$::Sakura agrees cheerfully, and follows me with a spring in her step.::
