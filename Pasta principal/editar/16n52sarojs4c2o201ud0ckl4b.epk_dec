18715::$$$message_0177_0000_0000$$$::I'm going to Strengthen Saber, right here where I summoned her.[lr]::
18716::$$$message_0177_0000_0001$$$::I'm not sure I can do that, but it's worth trying.::
18717::$$$message_0177_0001_0000$$$::"You are going to perform Strengthening...on me?"[lr]::
18718::$$$message_0177_0001_0001$$$::"Yeah. I know how hard it is to pass magical energy through humans other than yourself. But this is all I've got. The only thing I can really do is try to make you stronger, Saber."::
18719::$$$message_0177_0002_0000$$$::That's right.[lr]::
18720::$$$message_0177_0002_0001$$$::Even if I try making a new weapon with Projection, I won't be able to make anything stronger than Excalibur.[lr]::
18721::$$$message_0177_0002_0002$$$::With Gilgamesh's Noble Phantasm overwhelming the sacred sword, there's no point in giving Saber a new weapon.[lr]::
18722::$$$message_0177_0002_0003$$$::So there's no other option but to make Saber herself stronger.::
18723::$$$message_0177_0003_0000$$$::"Probably not a great chance of success here, and it might be uncomfortable for you. But I at least want to try.[lr]::
18724::$$$message_0177_0003_0001$$$::I feel bad for treating you like a thing, talking about Strengthening you. Please forgive me."::
18725::$$$message_0177_0004_0000$$$::"That is unnecessary. I will not feel any displeasure from this.[lr]::
18726::$$$message_0177_0004_0001$$$::If you are doing this for my benefit, I will gladly offer myself to you."[lr]::
18727::$$$message_0177_0004_0002$$$::Saber takes my hand and agrees to my plan.::
18728::$$$message_0177_0005_0000$$$::"I trust you, Master. I will temporarily lower my Magic Resistance, so please use your magecraft on me."[lr]::
18729::$$$message_0177_0005_0001$$$::Saber entrusts her body to me while she still holds my hand. ::
18730::$$$message_0177_0006_0000$$$::"Got it. Bear with me for a little bit, Saber."[lr]::
18731::$$$message_0177_0006_0001$$$::I concentrate and read Saber's body, her blueprint.[lr]::
18732::$$$message_0177_0006_0002$$$::I have a less than ten percent chance of success.[lr]::
18733::$$$message_0177_0006_0003$$$::I cast off my indecisiveness and activate the Strengthening magecraft with unprecedented clarity.::
18734::$$$message_0177_0007_0000$$$::The magecraft spell ends.[lr]::
18735::$$$message_0177_0007_0001$$$::I used almost all of my remaining magical energy to Strengthen Saberâ€¦::
18736::$$$message_0177_0008_0000$$$::"What do you think, Saber? Do you feel anything?[lr]::
18737::$$$message_0177_0008_0001$$$::I know the magical energy flowed into you, and I think you've gotten stronger..."::
18738::$$$message_0177_0009_0000$$$::"Eh? Can you not see the end result? Can you not tell that my speed and destructive power have increased?"::
18739::$$$message_0177_0010_0000$$$::"Uh...no, I can't tell.[lr]::
18740::$$$message_0177_0010_0001$$$::It might be called Strengthening, but we won't know unless we actually try it out. With magical energy flowing through you, all we have to do is see the end result."::
18741::$$$message_0177_0011_0000$$$::"Oh, I see. Even if you Strengthen a wooden sword, it does not simply shout that it has gotten stronger, nor does it look any different.[lr]::
18742::$$$message_0177_0011_0001$$$::Hm, I am embarrassed to admit that I have not noticed any changes either. Honestly, I do not feel any different."::
18743::$$$message_0177_0012_0000$$$::"Got it. I guess I wasted both our time."::
18744::$$$message_0177_0013_0000$$$::"No, it was by no means a waste.[lr]::
18745::$$$message_0177_0013_0001$$$::Your magecraft was functioning properly. Even if I am not stronger, I feel a warm sensation in my chest now.[lr]::
18746::$$$message_0177_0013_0002$$$::As long as this warmth remains, I will not be defeated. You have made me stronger, mentally."::
18747::$$$message_0177_0014_0000$$$::Saber has accepted my magecraft.[lr]::
18748::$$$message_0177_0014_0001$$$::And she's the one who made me stronger.[lr]::
18749::$$$message_0177_0014_0002$$$::Her words banish my fear and hesitation.[lr]::
18750::$$$message_0177_0014_0003$$$::Saber isn't the only one feeling a warmth in her heart.[lr]::
18751::$$$message_0177_0014_0004$$$::As long as I hold on to this feeling, I won't be afraid to fight.::Í×
