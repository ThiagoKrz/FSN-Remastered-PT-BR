42394::$$$message_0370_0000_0000$$$::...We walk through the forest.[lr]::
42395::$$$message_0370_0000_0001$$$::We're the only living humans among these infinite trees.::
42396::$$$message_0370_0001_0000$$$::I don't hear the breathing of any beasts, and the plants in winter are as lifeless as corpses.[lr]::
42397::$$$message_0370_0001_0001$$$::The endless sea of trees that seem to go on forever makes me constantly feel apprehension.::
42398::$$$message_0370_0002_0000$$$::It's already been three hours since we entered the forest.[lr]::
42399::$$$message_0370_0002_0001$$$::It's way past noon, and just as I have become unable to tell whether there have been any changes in the landscape...::
42400::$$$message_0370_0003_0000$$$::"...Found it.[lr]::
42401::$$$message_0370_0003_0001$$$::...Geez, I'm fed up even though I knew about it. They really built something like that in a place like this."::
42402::$$$message_0370_0004_0000$$$::I follow Tohsaka's line of sight.[lr]::
42403::$$$message_0370_0004_0001$$$::There's only darkness ahead.[lr]::
42404::$$$message_0370_0004_0002$$$::Between the trees.[lr]::
42405::$$$message_0370_0004_0003$$$::There is some incredibly out of place thing that can be seen through cracks that are so small, they could easily be missed by anybody who doesn't pay close attention.::
42406::$$$message_0370_0005_0000$$$::"...What is that? A... Wall?"[lr]::
42407::$$$message_0370_0005_0001$$$::"It's a wall. Geez, what's up with that? They brought that whole thing from their country."::
42408::$$$message_0370_0006_0000$$$::Tohsaka curses and heads to the strange object we see in the distance.[lr]::
42409::$$$message_0370_0006_0001$$$::I follow after her, still bewildered, unable to grasp what it is.::
42410::$$$message_0370_0007_0000$$$::We get out of the forest.[lr]::
42411::$$$message_0370_0007_0001$$$::The forest that seemed to be endless abruptly ends.[lr]::
42412::$$$message_0370_0007_0002$$$::No, it seems like the traces of the forest vanished, as if they carved out just this part with a big spoon.::
42413::$$$message_0370_0008_0000$$$::The gray sky curving above us is so high that I can't see everything.[lr]::
42414::$$$message_0370_0008_0001$$$::   A huge dome-like space.[lr]::
42415::$$$message_0370_0008_0002$$$::This is more like an underground kingdom, instead of an open space.::
42416::$$$message_0370_0009_0000$$$::That was Illyasviel's dwelling.[lr]::
42417::$$$message_0370_0009_0001$$$::The old castle built in the middle of the forest.[lr]::
42418::$$$message_0370_0009_0002$$$::It is a solitary castle in the forest that has no visitors, is too big for that girl to live in, and is too lonely to live in alone.::
42419::$$$message_0370_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42420::$$$message_0370_0010_0001$$$::...Anyway, it does no good to falter here.[lr]::
42421::$$$message_0370_0010_0002$$$::According to Tohsaka, Illyasviel knows that we came here.[lr]::
42422::$$$message_0370_0010_0003$$$::Then we should go confidently from the front entrance to show that we don't have any enmity.::
42423::$$$message_0370_0011_0000$$$::"All right, let's go, Tohsaka... Tohsaka?"[lr]::
42424::$$$message_0370_0011_0001$$$::Tohsaka looks up at the castle with an alarming expression.[lr]::
42425::$$$message_0370_0011_0002$$$::Her side profile looks as tense as it does when she's confronting an enemy.::
42426::$$$message_0370_0012_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. Is there something bothering you?"[lr]::
42427::$$$message_0370_0012_0001$$$::"...Yeah. There's someone else other than us."[lr]::
42428::$$$message_0370_0012_0002$$$::"Of course there is. This is where that Illya girl and Berserker live."::
42429::$$$message_0370_0013_0000$$$::"That's not it, there's someone else besides them... Shirou, we're going to enter from over here."[lr]::
42430::$$$message_0370_0013_0001$$$::"Huh... W-wait...!"::
42431::$$$message_0370_0014_0000$$$::Without a chance to stop her, Tohsaka starts running to the big tree by the wall.[lr]::
42432::$$$message_0370_0014_0001$$$::No, that's not all.[lr]::
42433::$$$message_0370_0014_0002$$$::Tohsaka grabs onto a branch and skillfully climbs up.::
42434::$$$message_0370_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42435::$$$message_0370_0015_0001$$$::I look up in astonishment.[lr]::
42436::$$$message_0370_0015_0002$$$::Tohsaka looks around the castle and...[lr]::
42437::$$$message_0370_0015_0003$$$::She jumps and kicks at the castle's second floor.::
42438::$$$message_0370_0016_0000$$$::A shattering sound.[lr]::
42439::$$$message_0370_0016_0001$$$::A window breaks, and the red figure disappears into the castle.::
42440::$$$message_0370_0017_0000$$$::"Come on, hurry...! Something's seriously wrong with this castle...!"[lr]::
42441::$$$message_0370_0017_0001$$$::"Ugh... Geez, aren't we here to talk...!?"[lr]::
42442::$$$message_0370_0017_0002$$$::But, what's done is done.[lr]::
42443::$$$message_0370_0017_0003$$$::I also climb the tree and jump into the second floor of the castle like Tohsaka.::
42444::$$$message_0370_0018_0000$$$::I go out to the hallway from the room we invaded.[lr]::
42445::$$$message_0370_0018_0001$$$::Before I can even marvel at how magnificent this place is, the abnormality Tohsaka mentioned earlier grabs my attention.::
42446::$$$message_0370_0019_0000$$$::The sound echoing is definitely the sound of battle.[lr]::
42447::$$$message_0370_0019_0001$$$::The sound of swords clashing.[lr]::
42448::$$$message_0370_0019_0002$$$::But... Is a storm-like sword fight like this even possible?[lr]::
42449::$$$message_0370_0019_0003$$$::Even the most intense sword fight that I've witnessed so far, the one between Saber and Berserker, didn't make these kinds of sounds.::
42450::$$$message_0370_0020_0000$$$::"...Oh."[lr]::
42451::$$$message_0370_0020_0001$$$::Then I suddenly realize.[lr]::
42452::$$$message_0370_0020_0002$$$::This doesn't sound like your average sword fight.[lr]::
42453::$$$message_0370_0020_0003$$$::This is one against many... There is literally a war going on somewhere in this castle.::
42454::$$$message_0370_0021_0000$$$::There's no doubt that one of them is Berserker.[lr]::
42455::$$$message_0370_0021_0001$$$::This castle is Illyasviel's castle.[lr]::
42456::$$$message_0370_0021_0002$$$::If a battle were to occur, it would only be when Berserker is attacking an intruder.::
42457::$$$message_0370_0022_0000$$$::I start running.[lr]::
42458::$$$message_0370_0022_0001$$$::The sounds are echoing from below.[lr]::
42459::$$$message_0370_0022_0002$$$::Judging from where the sounds are coming from relative to our entry point, the battle is in the center of the castle... In the reception hall.::
42460::$$$message_0370_0023_0000$$$::I run through the unfamiliar castle.[lr]::
42461::$$$message_0370_0023_0001$$$::This isn't the time to be exchanging opinions.[lr]::
42462::$$$message_0370_0023_0002$$$::I don't know what's happening, but it feels like it will lead to permanent consequences...W	เต
