50625::$$$message_0437_0000_0000$$$::After making a full round of the house,[lr]::
50626::$$$message_0437_0000_0001$$$::Saber is nowhere to be found. I even checked the detached guest rooms, but I can't find her.::
50627::$$$message_0437_0001_0000$$$::"That's weird. That armor isn't exactly camouflage..."[lr]::
50628::$$$message_0437_0001_0001$$$::Even so, a fully armed and armored Saber still eludes me.[lr]::
50629::$$$message_0437_0001_0002$$$::Supposedly Servants can turn into spirit forms, but unfortunately she can't with me.[lr]::
50630::$$$message_0437_0001_0003$$$::No, first of all...::
50631::$$$message_0437_0002_0000$$$::"Even though I'm called a Master, I don't know anything about her."[lr]::
50632::$$$message_0437_0002_0001$$$::I don't even know what Saber is or how Servants are able to exist.::
50633::$$$message_0437_0003_0000$$$::The one thing I do know is...[lr]::
50634::$$$message_0437_0003_0001$$$::I feel I can get through this strange battle as long as I'm with this golden-haired knight.::
50635::$$$message_0437_0004_0000$$$::"She's not here either..."[lr]::
50636::$$$message_0437_0004_0001$$$::I've looked around the entire house.[lr]::
50637::$$$message_0437_0004_0002$$$::It's the size of a traditional Japanese inn, but I played hide-and-seek with Fuji-nee when I was a kid, so I know the most efficient way to search it.[lr]::
50638::$$$message_0437_0004_0003$$$::She must be in the dojo or the shed if she isn't in the house itself.::
50639::$$$message_0437_0005_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
50640::$$$message_0437_0005_0001$$$::Saber is in the still, silent dojo.[lr]::
50641::$$$message_0437_0005_0002$$$::...But, her appearance is different from yesterday.[lr]::
50642::$$$message_0437_0005_0003$$$::Saber is sitting upright, her legs tucked beneath herself, on the wooden floor. She's not wearing her armor.[lr]::
50643::$$$message_0437_0005_0004$$$::She changed into rather elegant clothes that really suit her. Now she sits in wait.::
50644::$$$message_0437_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50645::$$$message_0437_0006_0001$$$::...Words fail me at the sight.[lr]::
50646::$$$message_0437_0006_0002$$$::Saber looks beautiful. She strikes a refined, dignified figure as she sits there, eyes closed.[lr]::
50647::$$$message_0437_0006_0003$$$::She seems to almost merge with the silence, like nothing so much as still water.::
50648::$$$message_0437_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50649::$$$message_0437_0007_0001$$$::And that rids me of any further doubt in my mind.[lr]::
50650::$$$message_0437_0007_0002$$$::Servant or whatever it is, she seems sacrosanct. [lr]::
50651::$$$message_0437_0007_0003$$$::So... From now on, I'm sure I won't go down the wrong path.::
50652::$$$message_0437_0008_0000$$$::"Saber."[lr]::
50653::$$$message_0437_0008_0001$$$::I call to her.[lr]::
50654::$$$message_0437_0008_0002$$$::Saber calmly opens her eyes and slowly meets my gaze.::
50655::$$$message_0437_0009_0000$$$::"You are awake, Shirou."[lr]::
50656::$$$message_0437_0009_0001$$$::Her voice is serene.[lr]::
50657::$$$message_0437_0009_0002$$$::Something rich and calm about her voice hangs in the air.::
50658::$$$message_0437_0010_0000$$$::"Yeah, I just woke up. What are you doing here?"[lr]::
50659::$$$message_0437_0010_0001$$$::"I was resting. Since I cannot treat you, I figured that I would at least ensure that my body is in as perfect a condition as I can make it."::
50660::$$$message_0437_0011_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
50661::$$$message_0437_0011_0001$$$::Saber gives a straightforward response as she scrutinizes me.[lr]::
50662::$$$message_0437_0011_0002$$$::...This is, um...[lr]::
50663::$$$message_0437_0011_0003$$$::Making me nervous in a different way than Tohsaka did.::
50664::$$$message_0437_0012_0000$$$::"Shirou? What is it? Is your body still...?"[lr]::
50665::$$$message_0437_0012_0001$$$::"N-no, I'm totally fine...! It's something else, really, it's nothing...!"[lr]::
50666::$$$message_0437_0012_0002$$$::I quickly take a step back and shake my head.::
50667::$$$message_0437_0013_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
50668::$$$message_0437_0013_0001$$$::Looking away from Saber[line2]who tilts her head at me quizzically[line2]I try to calm my rapid heartbeat.::
50669::$$$message_0437_0014_0000$$$::"Get a hold of yourself! Why are you getting worked up like this...!"[lr]::
50670::$$$message_0437_0014_0001$$$::I take a deep breath.[lr]::
50671::$$$message_0437_0014_0002$$$::...But I don't think this feeling is going away anytime soon.::
50672::$$$message_0437_0015_0000$$$::"...Man, why did she have to change...?"[lr]::
50673::$$$message_0437_0015_0001$$$::I can't help myself.[lr]::
50674::$$$message_0437_0015_0002$$$::With Saber in that outfit, I can't help but actually think she's real now. ::
50675::$$$message_0437_0016_0000$$$::...Seriously, she's drop-dead gorgeous.[lr]::
50676::$$$message_0437_0016_0001$$$::I mean I saw that yesterday, but it's actually setting in now.::
50677::$$$message_0437_0017_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
50678::$$$message_0437_0017_0001$$$::As soon as we make eye contact, I can feel my nervousness grow.[lr]::
50679::$$$message_0437_0017_0002$$$::Then again, I wasn't looking everywhere for her just to stay silent.[lr]::
50680::$$$message_0437_0017_0003$$$::It's uncomfortable, but I can't let it be awkward forever.::
50681::$$$message_0437_0018_0000$$$::"...All right.[lr]::
50682::$$$message_0437_0018_0001$$$::May I, Saber? This is the first time for us to sit down and actually figure things out, but..."[lr]::
50683::$$$message_0437_0018_0002$$$::I bite the bullet.::
50684::$$$message_0437_0019_0000$$$::    But then...[lr]::
50685::$$$message_0437_0019_0001$$$::"Shirou. Before that, there is something that I would address regarding last night."[lr]::
50686::$$$message_0437_0019_0002$$$::"Mm? Sure, what is it?"::
50687::$$$message_0437_0020_0000$$$::"As I said: last night.[lr]::
50688::$$$message_0437_0020_0001$$$::You are my Master. It is troubling if you take such actions. Combat is my territory, so please stay behind me and out of the direct line of fire."::
50689::$$$message_0437_0021_0000$$$::"Last night...?"[lr]::
50690::$$$message_0437_0021_0001$$$::I try to recall what all happened.[lr]::
50691::$$$message_0437_0021_0002$$$::...Is Saber talking about how I tried to pull her away from Archer's attack...?::
50692::$$$message_0437_0022_0000$$$::"...Mrgh. I couldn't help it. If you're risking your life, it's just about all I can do. This wouldn't be a partnership otherwise. It's only natural to help if your partner is in danger."::
50693::$$$message_0437_0023_0000$$$::"...Truly? You still do not know what Servants are, yet you already have that much faith in me?"[lr]::
50694::$$$message_0437_0023_0001$$$::Huh, Saber seems genuinely surprised.::
50695::$$$message_0437_0024_0000$$$::"Well, we shook on it. And you've saved me so many times already. I would be crazy not to trust you by now."[lr]::
50696::$$$message_0437_0024_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50697::$$$message_0437_0024_0002$$$::Saber looks up at me, stunned.::
50698::$$$message_0437_0025_0000$$$::"Uh... Is that not what our contract means?"[lr]::
50699::$$$message_0437_0025_0001$$$::I have to ask now that I'm second guessing myself.[lr]::
50700::$$$message_0437_0025_0002$$$::Saber quietly shakes her head.::
50701::$$$message_0437_0026_0000$$$::"As a Servant, I appreciate your words.[lr]::
50702::$$$message_0437_0026_0001$$$::Besides, I would have been fatally wounded if you had not done so. The methods by which you acted were problematic, but your purpose was correct."::
50703::$$$message_0437_0027_0000$$$::"...I see. That's good. I was desperate, but it worked out in the end, huh?"[lr]::
50704::$$$message_0437_0027_0001$$$::"Yes. However, please refrain from such actions from now on. Even if I am wounded, I will heal immediately if you are alive and well. But, if you were to be wounded, I do not have any way to heal you."::
50705::$$$message_0437_0028_0000$$$::"Ugh... Got it, I'll be careful. You're right, that was reckless of me. I'll do better next time."[lr]::
50706::$$$message_0437_0028_0001$$$::I'm not sure exactly [font italic=true]how[font italic=false], but I do realize I shouldn't keep just jumping in without thinking.[lr]::
50707::$$$message_0437_0028_0002$$$::And so...::
50708::$$$message_0437_0029_0000$$$::"Yes. That is the proper response, Master."[lr]::
50709::$$$message_0437_0029_0001$$$::I must have been acting funny to her.[lr]::
50710::$$$message_0437_0029_0002$$$::I think she smiled briefly.::
50711::$$$message_0437_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50712::$$$message_0437_0030_0001$$$::I shake off my blush.[lr]::
50713::$$$message_0437_0030_0002$$$::More importantly, there's something that I have to get clear right now.[lr]::
50714::$$$message_0437_0030_0003$$$::I should've asked her yesterday anyway.[lr]::
50715::$$$message_0437_0030_0004$$$::If she really is my Servant...[lr]::
50716::$$$message_0437_0030_0005$$$::And if I...really am going to participate in this battle.::
