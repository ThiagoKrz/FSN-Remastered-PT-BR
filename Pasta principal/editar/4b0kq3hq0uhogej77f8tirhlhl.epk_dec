17481::$$$message_0163_0000_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
17482::$$$message_0163_0000_0001$$$::...after giving me several medications, Tohsaka instructs me to do simple Strengthening exercises while we keep an eye on how my body reacts.[lr]::
17483::$$$message_0163_0000_0002$$$::Apparently she's checking to see that nothing goes wrong inside me when I use magical energy.[lr]::
17484::$$$message_0163_0000_0003$$$::Honestly, Tohsaka seems more like a doctor more than a teacher today.::
17485::$$$message_0163_0001_0000$$$::"Okay. There don't seem to be any problems. You probably don't need to come here tomorrow, then."[lr]::
17486::$$$message_0163_0001_0001$$$::"Eh?"::
17487::$$$message_0163_0002_0000$$$::That's a bit of a surprise.[lr]::
17488::$$$message_0163_0002_0001$$$::I don't have to come tomorrow...that means...::
17489::$$$message_0163_0003_0000$$$::"Yep. There's nothing else I can teach you. If you want to focus on learning magecraft, you should do it after the war.[lr]::
17490::$$$message_0163_0003_0001$$$::Besides with Archer gone, my alliance with you is long over."::
17491::$$$message_0163_0004_0000$$$::"Wha...?"[lr]::
17492::$$$message_0163_0004_0001$$$::I suddenly realize.[lr]::
17493::$$$message_0163_0004_0002$$$::Our alliance was only so we could defeat Berserker.::
17494::$$$message_0163_0005_0000$$$::Now that Berserker's gone, and Tohsaka doesn't have a Servant anymore...[lr]::
17495::$$$message_0163_0005_0001$$$::...our living arrangement should be over. Should have ended yesterday, even.::
17496::$$$message_0163_0006_0000$$$::"So what are you going to do now, Tohsaka? Are you going to go to Kotomine's place?"[lr]::
17497::$$$message_0163_0006_0001$$$::That'd probably be the normal thing to do.[lr]::
17498::$$$message_0163_0006_0002$$$::Tohsaka and Father Kotomine are student and disciple, so it shouldn't be an issue for her to go asking him for protection.::
17499::$$$message_0163_0007_0000$$$::"Why? Of course I'm not going there. I haven't lost yet. There's no reason I can't fight without a Servant.[lr]::
17500::$$$message_0163_0007_0001$$$::Besides, running away isn't really my style. I decided to fight, so I'm seeing this through to the end."::
17501::$$$message_0163_0008_0000$$$::She says this like it should be the most obvious thing in the world.[lr]::
17502::$$$message_0163_0008_0001$$$::And she's proud about that.::
17503::$$$message_0163_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
17504::$$$message_0163_0009_0001$$$::My eyes widen.[lr]::
17505::$$$message_0163_0009_0002$$$::Well, okay, maybe not.[lr]::
17506::$$$message_0163_0009_0003$$$::I should have expected this from Tohsaka.[lr]::
17507::$$$message_0163_0009_0004$$$::She's unbelievably stubborn...[lr]::
17508::$$$message_0163_0009_0005$$$::...absolutely selfish...[lr]::
17509::$$$message_0163_0009_0006$$$::...and captivatingly brilliant.::
17510::$$$message_0163_0010_0000$$$::"Then what are you going to do? Are you going to go out on your own now?[lr]::
17511::$$$message_0163_0010_0001$$$::There are still Servants and Masters left."::
17512::$$$message_0163_0011_0000$$$::"Let's see... I think I'll stay here awhile to gather information.[lr]::
17513::$$$message_0163_0011_0001$$$::I should resume my research on Ryudou Temple too."[lr]::
17514::$$$message_0163_0011_0002$$$::"You're going to stay here...? A-are you sure!?[lr]::
17515::$$$message_0163_0011_0003$$$::It'd be a big help if you stayed, but our alliance ended, so..."::
17516::$$$message_0163_0012_0000$$$::"What are you talking about? We managed to beat Berserker thanks to Archer. Our alliance may have ended, but you still owe me. And that's why you're obviously going to let me use your place until you've fully repaid your debt."::
17517::$$$message_0163_0013_0000$$$::"Besides. I said I would take responsibility until the end.[lr]::
17518::$$$message_0163_0013_0001$$$::You and I were teacher and student, even if it was brief. I'd be so worried about you if I left you to your devices, I wouldn't be able to concentrate on the Holy Grail War."::
17519::$$$message_0163_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
17520::$$$message_0163_0014_0001$$$::Oh right. [lr]::
17521::$$$message_0163_0014_0002$$$::It feels like a lifetime ago, so I'd nearly forgotten, but I've admired Rin because of exactly those qualities for a long time now.::
17522::$$$message_0163_0015_0000$$$::So I'm actually very happy.[lr]::
17523::$$$message_0163_0015_0001$$$::That's the Tohsaka I've always known and liked.[lr]::
17524::$$$message_0163_0015_0002$$$::Besides, if I ever saw the day a girl as stubborn as her gives up, I wouldn't know what to believe from then on.::
17525::$$$message_0163_0016_0000$$$::"Yeah. Thanks for sticking around, Tohsaka.[lr]::
17526::$$$message_0163_0016_0001$$$::Whatever else I might say, I wouldn't know what to do without you. Saber and I need you, Tohsaka."::
17527::$$$message_0163_0017_0000$$$::"That's fine. But don't say stuff like that. You're stupidly honest, yeah, but be careful about what you say. You could give people the wrong idea."::
17528::$$$message_0163_0018_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
17529::$$$message_0163_0018_0001$$$::I'm not sure why that upset Tohsaka so much.[lr]::
17530::$$$message_0163_0018_0002$$$::"Tohsaka, what do you mean I might give people the wrong idea? What wrong idea?"::
17531::$$$message_0163_0019_0000$$$::"Unbelievable. It just wasn't appropriate, okay? And my whole attitude should make clear I don't want you asking, so drop it."[lr]::
17532::$$$message_0163_0019_0001$$$::Uh...[lr]::
17533::$$$message_0163_0019_0002$$$::Tohsaka must be aware of some secret rule I'm not.::
17534::$$$message_0163_0020_0000$$$::"Good grief. I feel bad... Saber's got it tough.[lr]::
17535::$$$message_0163_0020_0001$$$::But then again, that's probably why you two work. You and Saber both have to be pretty freakin' dense, or else you'd never last."::
17536::$$$message_0163_0021_0000$$$::"Hmmm. Okay, I still don't get it, but I didn't miss what you said about feeling bad for Saber. What do you mean she has it tough?"::
17537::$$$message_0163_0022_0000$$$::"This is exactly what I'm talking about. I bet you haven't even noticed the changes in Saber."::
17538::$$$message_0163_0023_0000$$$::"Changes in Saber?"[lr]::
17539::$$$message_0163_0023_0001$$$::It's not about her appearance...right?[lr]::
17540::$$$message_0163_0023_0002$$$::If anything would have changed in Saber...::
17541::$$$message_0163_0024_0000$$$::"Oh right. She [font italic=true]has[font italic=false] been acting weird since this morning...[lr]::
17542::$$$message_0163_0024_0001$$$::No, I just thought she was in a bad mood because Illya was with us. She just sat there, all stiff and quiet, and when I asked if there was something wrong, she just got up and left, saying something about having had a dream."::
17543::$$$message_0163_0025_0000$$$::And I pretty much forgot about it in all the hustle and bustle over Illya.[lr]::
17544::$$$message_0163_0025_0001$$$::Yeah, Saber's been a little off since this morning, like her head is somewhere else.::
17545::$$$message_0163_0026_0000$$$::"Saber said she had a dream?"[lr]::
17546::$$$message_0163_0026_0001$$$::"Eh? That's the bit that surprises you?"[lr]::
17547::$$$message_0163_0026_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
17548::$$$message_0163_0026_0003$$$::[font italic=true]And now she's ignoring me.[font italic=false]::
17549::$$$message_0163_0027_0000$$$::"Hey. Don't go quiet on me. That face you're making has me nervous."[lr]::
17550::$$$message_0163_0027_0001$$$::"Eh? Oh, it's nothing major.[lr]::
17551::$$$message_0163_0027_0002$$$::It's just that Servants don't typically dream."[lr]::
17552::$$$message_0163_0027_0003$$$::[font italic=true]Huh?[font italic=false][lr]::
17553::$$$message_0163_0027_0004$$$::Servants don't...dream?::
17554::$$$message_0163_0028_0000$$$::"That's right. Servants don't dream.[lr]::
17555::$$$message_0163_0028_0001$$$::But if she says she did, then it wasn't a dream. It was someone's memory."::
17556::$$$message_0163_0029_0000$$$::Maybe Tohsaka's experienced it before.[lr]::
17557::$$$message_0163_0029_0001$$$::The coldness in her voice runs so counter to her usual cheerfulness.::a_
