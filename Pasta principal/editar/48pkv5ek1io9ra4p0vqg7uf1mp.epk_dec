57955::$$$message_0517_0000_0000$$$::"I'm home... Wait, huh? Is Fuji-nee already back?"[lr]::
57956::$$$message_0517_0000_0001$$$::I take off my shoes and enter the hallway.[lr]::
57957::$$$message_0517_0000_0002$$$::It's not even 6:00 PM yet, so why is the kyudo club advisor back so early?::
57958::$$$message_0517_0001_0000$$$::"Welcome home, Shirou."[lr]::
57959::$$$message_0517_0001_0001$$$::"...Mrgh. There you are, you little nincompoop."[lr]::
57960::$$$message_0517_0001_0002$$$::Saber greets me while seated in a polite seiza posture, while Fuji-nee is very improperly resting her face on the coffee table.::
57961::$$$message_0517_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57962::$$$message_0517_0002_0001$$$::There's a shadow of defeat in my adoptive guardian's eyes.[lr]::
57963::$$$message_0517_0002_0002$$$::I'm curious as to why, but experience tells me it's probably no big deal.::
57964::$$$message_0517_0003_0000$$$::"Sorry I'm late. Did anything weird happen while I was out, Saber?"[lr]::
57965::$$$message_0517_0003_0001$$$::"Nothing in particular. What about you, Shirou? Was there anything of note at school?"::
57966::$$$message_0517_0004_0000$$$::"Nothing on my end, either. Shinji didn't show up and school was business as usual. I think we can cross him off our list of people to watch for now..."[lr]::
57967::$$$message_0517_0004_0001$$$::Using roundabout language, I report to Saber that there are no other Masters at school.::
57968::$$$message_0517_0005_0000$$$::"Hmm. Something reeks. This bittersweet post-rainshower aroma, like a 10,000-yen bill you hid on payday but can't remember where you put it, is, without a doubt, the stench of secrets!"[lr]::
57969::$$$message_0517_0005_0001$$$::She sniffs the air like a dog off its leash.::
57970::$$$message_0517_0006_0000$$$::"I smell rusty shackles on you, Shirou. How very shady.[lr]::
57971::$$$message_0517_0006_0001$$$::Are you hiding something from your big sister?"[lr]::
57972::$$$message_0517_0006_0002$$$::"Oh, wow."[lr]::
57973::$$$message_0517_0006_0003$$$::I don't believe it.[lr]::
57974::$$$message_0517_0006_0004$$$::How is she this hammered so early in the day?::
57975::$$$message_0517_0007_0000$$$::"...Saber. What happened to Fuji-nee? The tiger doesn't get this drunk unless something really crazy happens."[lr]::
57976::$$$message_0517_0007_0001$$$::"Er...I'm not sure. I thought Taiga might be feeling out of sorts because she's hungry."[lr]::
57977::$$$message_0517_0007_0002$$$::Saber says something terribly cutting, and with such ease.::
57978::$$$message_0517_0008_0000$$$::"That's a load of crap! Saber, you said you wanted to see my skills and then you beat me to a pulp!"[lr]::
57979::$$$message_0517_0008_0001$$$::Fuji-nee pounds the table.::
57980::$$$message_0517_0009_0000$$$::...Whether out of frustration or fear, she scurries behind me and loudly boos Saber in protest.[lr]::
57981::$$$message_0517_0009_0001$$$::Also, she sure is acting all buddy-buddy with Saber real fast.::
57982::$$$message_0517_0010_0000$$$::"Saber...did you spar with Fuji-nee?"[lr]::
57983::$$$message_0517_0010_0001$$$::"Ah...well, I suggested that Taiga get some exercise if she had free time. It was a mock duel with bamboo swords for safety, and she consented, so[line2]"::
57984::$$$message_0517_0011_0000$$$::"Don't believe her lies, Shirou. Saber came after me with murder in her eyes. I can tell. I know guys with guns.[lr]::
57985::$$$message_0517_0011_0001$$$::She meant to kill me. I'm absolutely, positively sure! She pounded me flat as soon as I let my guard down..."::
57986::$$$message_0517_0012_0000$$$::Fuji-nee trembles.[lr]::
57987::$$$message_0517_0012_0001$$$::"Saber. Did you..."[lr]::
57988::$$$message_0517_0012_0002$$$::Did you fight Fuji-nee like you really meant it...?::
57989::$$$message_0517_0013_0000$$$::"Eh...? Well, I may have been a little enthusiastic.[lr]::
57990::$$$message_0517_0013_0001$$$::I was tired of waiting for you to come home, and Taiga's skills were greater than expected, so perhaps I just acted on instinct..."[lr]::
57991::$$$message_0517_0013_0002$$$::Wow. That sounds terrifying.[lr]::
57992::$$$message_0517_0013_0003$$$::Fuji-nee reached an impressive 5-dan in kendo at her age, but Saber's on a completely different level.::
57993::$$$message_0517_0014_0000$$$::"A-anyway, donâ€™t go sneaking into Saberâ€™s room at night or in the morning if you value your life![lr]::
57994::$$$message_0517_0014_0001$$$::Hell will be unleashed upon this world if you make a move on her! You will be wiped off the face of the Earth and won't even have a corpse left to collect!"[lr]::
57995::$$$message_0517_0014_0002$$$::"...Hmm."::
57996::$$$message_0517_0015_0000$$$::She's right.[lr]::
57997::$$$message_0517_0015_0001$$$::I still have another problem to deal with.[lr]::
57998::$$$message_0517_0015_0002$$$::What do I do with Saber, who insists on sleeping in the same room as me?[lr]::
57999::$$$message_0517_0015_0003$$$::I'm a growing young man, and I have...issues with a girl like Saber sleeping in the same room.::
58000::$$$message_0517_0016_0000$$$::"You needn't concern yourself with that, Taiga. I serve at Shirou's command. I would never raise a hand against him."::
58001::$$$message_0517_0017_0000$$$::"Hm? Hmm? You serve... What was that, Saber?"[lr]::
58002::$$$message_0517_0017_0001$$$::"Think nothing of it. More importantly, to avoid any misunderstandings, I would inform you that I will be retiring to Shirou's chambers tonight."[lr]::
58003::$$$message_0517_0017_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58004::$$$message_0517_0017_0003$$$::Fuji-nee freezes in her tracks.::
58005::$$$message_0517_0018_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
58006::$$$message_0517_0018_0001$$$::Oh no...[lr]::
58007::$$$message_0517_0018_0002$$$::Given how we're positioned and the power balance between us, she's definitely gonna do it...::
58008::$$$message_0517_0019_0000$$$::"Fuji-nee. Actually, I've been hiding something from you since yesterday."[lr]::
58009::$$$message_0517_0019_0001$$$::I hear Fuji-nee from behind me.[lr]::
58010::$$$message_0517_0019_0002$$$::"Hup."[lr]::
58011::$$$message_0517_0019_0003$$$::Wow. She's totally ignoring me, and I just heard a sound like a phone book being slammed on a table.::
58012::$$$message_0517_0020_0000$$$::"Listen to me.[lr]::
58013::$$$message_0517_0020_0001$$$::Saber doesn't understand Japanese."[lr]::
58014::$$$message_0517_0020_0002$$$::"Ready, and..."[lr]::
58015::$$$message_0517_0020_0003$$$::Ah, there it is: [lr]::
58016::$$$message_0517_0020_0004$$$::the sensation of being put in a sleeper choke hold from behind.[lr]::
58017::$$$message_0517_0020_0005$$$::Fuji-nee doesn't know how to hold back her own strength, so when she has me by the neck, I'm in serious danger[line2]::
58018::$$$message_0517_0021_0000$$$::"Wait, this is not the time for that! Hey! F-Fuji-nee, you win! I give up, so[line2]ow, I'm really gonna fall!"[lr]::
58019::$$$message_0517_0021_0001$$$::Crack. Crack.[lr]::
58020::$$$message_0517_0021_0002$$$::Fuji-nee's answer is to grapple me harder in a magnificent grinding of bone and flesh.::
58021::$$$message_0517_0022_0000$$$::"Uwagh, I give, I give! Stop it! And don't throw me next!"[lr]::
58022::$$$message_0517_0022_0001$$$::In my fading consciousness, I manage to tap Fuji-nee's arm.[lr]::
58023::$$$message_0517_0022_0002$$$::However...::
58024::$$$message_0517_0023_0000$$$::"Aw, shaddup! Eat dirt, you lazy son! That's not how I raised you! Waaahhh!!!"[lr]::
58025::$$$message_0517_0023_0001$$$::    Ah, I'm going down.[lr]::
58026::$$$message_0517_0023_0002$$$::Damn, just...one problem after another...::
58027::$$$message_0517_0024_0000$$$::"Jeez, that was awful."[lr]::
58028::$$$message_0517_0024_0001$$$::My neck makes cracking noises.[lr]::
58029::$$$message_0517_0024_0002$$$::Bent nearly at a right angle, I managed to get off with only bruises thanks to my daily training.::
58030::$$$message_0517_0025_0000$$$::"Ugh, how disappointing... I thought I could twist and let you go down into a roll, but you're heavier than I thought. It took everything I had just to throw you."::
58031::$$$message_0517_0026_0000$$$::"Obviously. I'm not a little kid anymore, you know. Stop trying to suplex me with those skinny arms. You could've hurt yourself."[lr]::
58032::$$$message_0517_0026_0001$$$::"...I've learned my lesson."::
58033::$$$message_0517_0027_0000$$$::"You too, Saber. We're sleeping in adjacent rooms, not the same room."[lr]::
58034::$$$message_0517_0027_0001$$$::"Mmm... But it's to protect you, Shirou."::
58035::$$$message_0517_0028_0000$$$::"You're protecting me plenty already. I wouldn't know what to do with myself if we stayed in the same bedroom. I'm sorry, but this is the best I can do. It's a hill I have to die on."[lr]::
58036::$$$message_0517_0028_0001$$$::"Mmrgh... You're asking a lot."::
58037::$$$message_0517_0029_0000$$$::"As long as both of you understand...All right, time to get ready for dinner."[lr]::
58038::$$$message_0517_0029_0001$$$::I stand up, stretching my neck.::
58039::$$$message_0517_0030_0000$$$::"Oh right, Fuji-nee.[lr]::
58040::$$$message_0517_0030_0001$$$::I'm thinking of having Sakura stay over starting today. Is that okay? I'll put her in the guesthouse that we gave Saber before."[lr]::
58041::$$$message_0517_0030_0002$$$::"Sakura's staying over? That's fine with me, but why the sudden change of heart? You're acting kind of weird lately."::
58042::$$$message_0517_0031_0000$$$::"...Well, Sakura doesn't look like she's feeling well lately. It's probably because Shinji's never home. She should have someone around to look after her."::
58043::$$$message_0517_0032_0000$$$::"Mmhmm... Okay. And have you told Sakura yet? At club today, she looked no worse for wear."::
58044::$$$message_0517_0033_0000$$$::"But she's going to[line2]I mean, what about you and club? Why are you back so early today?"[lr]::
58045::$$$message_0517_0033_0001$$$::"Hm? Oh, someone got hurt. I let Mitsuzuri take care of it, and then I came straight here after sending the students home."::
58046::$$$message_0517_0034_0000$$$::...Something like that happened, huh?[lr]::
58047::$$$message_0517_0034_0001$$$::It's a little concerning to hear that someone got injured at club, but Fuji-nee wouldn't be here if it was serious.[lr]::
58048::$$$message_0517_0034_0002$$$::Someone probably just jammed their finger or got anemic.::
58049::$$$message_0517_0035_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58050::$$$message_0517_0035_0001$$$::Anyway, this is my chance.[lr]::
58051::$$$message_0517_0035_0002$$$::Sakura's like family to both me and Fuji-nee.[lr]::
58052::$$$message_0517_0035_0003$$$::Then, I should...[lr]::½C
