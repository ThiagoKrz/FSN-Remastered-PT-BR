65886::$$$message_0609_0000_0000$$$::"Here's your breakfast!"[lr]::
65887::$$$message_0609_0000_0001$$$::Illya thrusts a plate at me as soon as I enter the living room.[lr]::
65888::$$$message_0609_0000_0002$$$::Arranged on it are a black piece of toast, soft-looking sunny-side up eggs, and a neatly cut tomato.::
65889::$$$message_0609_0001_0000$$$::"Mm. Thanks."[lr]::
65890::$$$message_0609_0001_0001$$$::I accept it, still feeling dizzy, take my usual place at the dining table, and bite into the crunchy toast.[lr]::
65891::$$$message_0609_0001_0002$$$::The toast aside, she did a good job on the eggs. I wonder if she learned by watching, or if Sakura or Tohsaka taught her.[lr]::
65892::$$$message_0609_0001_0003$$$::Anyway, I'd better give her full marks for this first attempt.::
65893::$$$message_0609_0002_0000$$$::"It's good."[lr]::
65894::$$$message_0609_0002_0001$$$::I keep chewing on the toast.[lr]::
65895::$$$message_0609_0002_0002$$$::Illya watches me eat, looking neither proud or ecstatic, just satisfied.::
65896::$$$message_0609_0003_0000$$$::I avoid saying that the toast has the texture of charcoal. Wouldn't want to ruin the mood.[lr]::
65897::$$$message_0609_0003_0001$$$::Because it actually does taste good.[lr]::
65898::$$$message_0609_0003_0002$$$::Everyone has their own preferences. Some people happen to like their toast black and hard.::
65899::$$$message_0609_0004_0000$$$::"Oh, come on. Eating burned food like that is bad for you."[lr]::
65900::$$$message_0609_0004_0001$$$::"You fool. Whether it's rice or bread, it's always nice to have a dark crust."[lr]::
65901::$$$message_0609_0004_0002$$$::"...Hey Emiya, did you hit your head?"[lr]::
65902::$$$message_0609_0004_0003$$$::"It's good, really. It's okay to be a bit rough with cooking."[lr]::
65903::$$$message_0609_0004_0004$$$::"You really must be still half-asleep... This is no time to be so carefree, you know."::
65904::$$$message_0609_0005_0000$$$::Tohsaka looks at the TV.[lr]::
65905::$$$message_0609_0005_0001$$$::It's on and playing the news.::
65906::$$$message_0609_0006_0000$$$::   Am I having deja vu?[lr]::
65907::$$$message_0609_0006_0001$$$::The story they're talking about should have happened a long time ago[line2]Suddenly, my sluggish mind kicks back into gear.::
65908::$$$message_0609_0007_0000$$$::I read the captions on the screen: [lr]::
65909::$$$message_0609_0007_0001$$$::Comas in Shinto, last night in the early dawn.[lr]::
65910::$$$message_0609_0007_0002$$$::People lost consciousness and didn't wake up.[lr]::
65911::$$$message_0609_0007_0003$$$::It's believed to have the same cause as the mass poisonings that happened recently, but something is different about them.[lr]::
65912::$$$message_0609_0007_0004$$$::They were affected in an area 50 meters wide.[lr]::
65913::$$$message_0609_0007_0005$$$::It had only happened within a single building or so before, but the radius of this latest incident was dramatically wider.::
65914::$$$message_0609_0008_0000$$$::...But that isn't the problem.[lr]::
65915::$$$message_0609_0008_0001$$$::At the end of the news report, the number of victims is listed.[lr]::
65916::$$$message_0609_0008_0002$$$::Three digits' worth of people in the hospital...and people missing, too.::
65917::$$$message_0609_0009_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, this is..."[lr]::
65918::$$$message_0609_0009_0001$$$::"Yeah. Fourteen missing people. I'm sure that number will go up the more they investigate, but it looks like about a tenth of the total victims were completely consumed."::
65919::$$$message_0609_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65920::$$$message_0609_0010_0001$$$::My mind freezes.[lr]::
65921::$$$message_0609_0010_0002$$$::Unconsciously...::
65922::$$$message_0609_0011_0000$$$::"Get it? I don't know if Zouken or the Shadow is behind this, but either way, the number of victims is on a whole new level.[lr]::
65923::$$$message_0609_0011_0001$$$::At this rate, they might eat a whole city block in a few days."::
65924::$$$message_0609_0012_0000$$$::...I squeeze my wrapped left arm tightly.::
65925::$$$message_0609_0013_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. Are the people who are missing..."[lr]::
65926::$$$message_0609_0013_0001$$$::Dead? I confirm with her.[lr]::
65927::$$$message_0609_0013_0002$$$::Without saying anything, she looks away and nods.::
65928::$$$message_0609_0014_0000$$$::"...Conversation's over. I know how you feel, but you can feel guilty later.[lr]::
65929::$$$message_0609_0014_0001$$$::They're starting to do whatever they want in the city because they can't come directly after us. They're getting sloppy because they don't see us as a threat.[lr]::
65930::$$$message_0609_0014_0002$$$::So, there's only one thing to do while they're underestimating us."::
65931::$$$message_0609_0015_0000$$$::Tohsaka quietly stands up.[lr]::
65932::$$$message_0609_0015_0001$$$::Her destination is clear.[lr]::
65933::$$$message_0609_0015_0002$$$::Without beckoning me to come along, she's headed for the dojo.:¶ ì
