65184::$$$message_0599_0000_0000$$$::I enter the living room.[lr]::
65185::$$$message_0599_0000_0001$$$::"Huh? Shirou, did you just come in from the hallway by the front door?"[lr]::
65186::$$$message_0599_0000_0002$$$::Illya's sitting alone in the living room.::
65187::$$$message_0599_0001_0000$$$::"Yeah. I stepped outside for a bit. Anything happen while I was out?"[lr]::
65188::$$$message_0599_0001_0001$$$::"Not really. But you should be resting in your room, Shirou.[lr]::
65189::$$$message_0599_0001_0002$$$::Your body's in just as much danger as Sakura's."::
65190::$$$message_0599_0002_0000$$$::"Yeah, thanks. But it's no big deal so long as the cloth is properly wrapped."[lr]::
65191::$$$message_0599_0002_0001$$$::"Oh, you'll collapse if you talk like that![lr]::
65192::$$$message_0599_0002_0002$$$::...Shirou. What happened outside?"::
65193::$$$message_0599_0003_0000$$$::"...Nothing."[lr]::
65194::$$$message_0599_0003_0001$$$::"That can't be true! I don't know what you did, but don't talk to me with hollow eyes like that!"::
65195::$$$message_0599_0004_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
65196::$$$message_0599_0004_0001$$$::She got mad at me.[lr]::
65197::$$$message_0599_0004_0002$$$::...I must be making a really stupid face right now.[lr]::
65198::$$$message_0599_0004_0003$$$::No wonder Illya's upset.::
65199::$$$message_0599_0005_0000$$$::"Sorry. I keep thinking about something, even though I know there's no point in obsessing over it."[lr]::
65200::$$$message_0599_0005_0001$$$::I shake my head.[lr]::
65201::$$$message_0599_0005_0002$$$::Like Illya says, I can't afford to space out.[lr]::
65202::$$$message_0599_0005_0003$$$::I can't face Sakura looking this pathetic either, so I'd better man up!::
65203::$$$message_0599_0006_0000$$$::"Okay, you pass. You look like you're feeling a little better.[lr]::
65204::$$$message_0599_0006_0001$$$::So, what did you want to ask me? I'll help you if you want, Shirou."[lr]::
65205::$$$message_0599_0006_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
65206::$$$message_0599_0007_0000$$$::...Oh, man.[lr]::
65207::$$$message_0599_0007_0001$$$::Sometimes, Illya can be incredibly kind.[lr]::
65208::$$$message_0599_0007_0002$$$::This is the second time she's reached out to help me when I was at my wits' end.[lr]::
65209::$$$message_0599_0007_0003$$$::It's hard to tell which of us is older now.::
65210::$$$message_0599_0008_0000$$$::"Okay. Then can I ask you something, Illya?"[lr]::
65211::$$$message_0599_0008_0001$$$::"Sure. I'll tell you anything. What do you want to know?"::
65212::$$$message_0599_0009_0000$$$::"...About the Holy Grail. Tell me about the Einzbern's Holy Grail."[lr]::
65213::$$$message_0599_0009_0001$$$::"...Ah, you found out. That's one of two things I would have preferred you didn't know."::
65214::$$$message_0599_0010_0000$$$::"Illya. Are you, um..."[lr]::
65215::$$$message_0599_0010_0001$$$::"Yeah. I'm a Holy Grail. I was never human to begin with. I'm just a homunculus made to look human."::
65216::$$$message_0599_0011_0000$$$::A homunculus. An artificial human.[lr]::
65217::$$$message_0599_0011_0001$$$::In alchemy, there are ways to create life from various magical components, without needing a mother to give birth.[lr]::
65218::$$$message_0599_0011_0002$$$::Born from less than respectable methods, homunculi are physically feeble as a general rule.[lr]::
65219::$$$message_0599_0011_0003$$$::They're alive like humans and look like humans, but they aren't human. That's how a select few can be created with enormous Magic Circuits.::
65220::$$$message_0599_0012_0000$$$::As living creatures, they're frail.[lr]::
65221::$$$message_0599_0012_0001$$$::But as mages[line2]no, as Magic Circuits, homunculi can greatly surpass humans.::
65222::$$$message_0599_0013_0000$$$::"...That's the gist of it.[lr]::
65223::$$$message_0599_0013_0001$$$::The Einzberns raised me to be both Holy Grail and Master.[lr]::
65224::$$$message_0599_0013_0002$$$::The role of the Holy Grail is to collect the souls of defeated Servants. If it's specialized at that task, it doesn't need to be human. It can even be a literal soup pot. It just needs to have a large enough capacity for containing souls."::
65225::$$$message_0599_0014_0000$$$::Illya speaks flatly.[lr]::
65226::$$$message_0599_0014_0001$$$::But this is the first time I've heard that the Holy Grail is meant to collect Servants.::
65227::$$$message_0599_0015_0000$$$::"Of course, it's more like return than recovery.[lr]::
65228::$$$message_0599_0015_0001$$$::Servants are summoned by the Holy Grail. Then, they need to return through the Holy Grail once they're defeated, right? I'm the only Einzbern Grail in this town, so I should be the one collecting all of those souls."::
65229::$$$message_0599_0016_0000$$$::"...But there's someone other than me functioning as a Holy Grail.[lr]::
65230::$$$message_0599_0016_0001$$$::I realized it when Caster and Lancer were taken. Some other force stronger than me pulled them away.[lr]::
65231::$$$message_0599_0016_0002$$$::That's how they've taken most of the Servants.[lr]::
65232::$$$message_0599_0016_0003$$$::...I only managed to collect Archer, since he disappeared right in front of me."::
65233::$$$message_0599_0017_0000$$$::...She doesn't need to explain the rest: [lr]::
65234::$$$message_0599_0017_0001$$$::the other Holy Grail is Sakura.[lr]::
65235::$$$message_0599_0017_0002$$$::According to Illya, Sakura has already taken in Caster and Lancer...even Saber and Berserker, too.::
65236::$$$message_0599_0018_0000$$$::"Four Servants' souls... But Illya, can you even keep them under control? I thought the basic rule is that a human body can only contain one soul."::
65237::$$$message_0599_0019_0000$$$::"Yeah. That's doubly true when it comes to Heroic Spirits.[lr]::
65238::$$$message_0599_0019_0001$$$::Freed of the molds we call 'classes,' pure Servant souls contain a gigantic amount of magical energy. Taking in even one is like unleashing a typhoon inside your body.[lr]::
65239::$$$message_0599_0019_0002$$$::And the Holy Grail is designed to collect seven.[lr]::
65240::$$$message_0599_0019_0003$$$::The container can't hold all of them."::
65241::$$$message_0599_0020_0000$$$::"That's why Holy Grails have been soulless, 'nonliving' vessels until now. The Holy Grail's main function is to collect, unify, and control seven Heroic Spirits' worth of souls.[lr]::
65242::$$$message_0599_0020_0001$$$::There isn't any room to run unnecessary programs. Any personality the Holy Grail has is erased by its main function."::
65243::$$$message_0599_0021_0000$$$::"What I'm saying, Shirou, is that as the Holy Grail nears completion, it begins to lose its human functions.[lr]::
65244::$$$message_0599_0021_0001$$$::That applies to me, too. The more Servants I collect, the more I have to cut out my human functions in order to control them."::
65245::$$$message_0599_0022_0000$$$::"I can repurpose the magical energy that I would use to move my limbs, in order to more finely control the souls.[lr]::
65246::$$$message_0599_0022_0001$$$::If I stop breathing, I can stop the souls from leaking out.[lr]::
65247::$$$message_0599_0022_0002$$$::If I assign the part of my brain that makes up my personality to pure calculation work, I can stabilize the consolidation of the souls."::
65248::$$$message_0599_0023_0000$$$::"The same goes for Sakura. Once she becomes a Holy Grail, her human personality will stop working. She won't be able to afford to stay human."::
65249::$$$message_0599_0024_0000$$$::"Though, I will say...[lr]::
65250::$$$message_0599_0024_0001$$$::The difference between me and Sakura is that I can switch over at will, while Sakura is being overwritten. She's an incomplete Black Grail that doesn't have the right to refuse."::
65251::$$$message_0599_0025_0000$$$::Illya explains it all without a hint of emotion.[lr]::
65252::$$$message_0599_0025_0001$$$::...Illya knew all along.[lr]::
65253::$$$message_0599_0025_0002$$$::She's probably known since she was born. No, even before that.[lr]::
65254::$$$message_0599_0025_0003$$$::Her life was created purely for this absurd purpose.::
65255::$$$message_0599_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65256::$$$message_0599_0026_0001$$$::Still, there's a silver lining in this.[lr]::
65257::$$$message_0599_0026_0002$$$::I breathe a sigh of relief and look up gratefully.::
65258::$$$message_0599_0027_0000$$$::"What is it, Shirou? I said that I'm beyond saving, just like Sakura, you know."[lr]::
65259::$$$message_0599_0027_0001$$$::I know that.[lr]::
65260::$$$message_0599_0027_0002$$$::I know that, but still.::
65261::$$$message_0599_0028_0000$$$::"You're splitting the souls with Sakura, so you're still okay."[lr]::
65262::$$$message_0599_0028_0001$$$::"Hmm. That's true. Sakura's taken most of them, so there isn't anything stopping me from being Illya. Rider and Assassin... Maybe I won't need to lose my human functions even if I take them both."::
65263::$$$message_0599_0029_0000$$$::Right. That's the one saving grace of this situation.[lr]::
65264::$$$message_0599_0029_0001$$$::If I were to lose Illya too, it would mean that I failed to protect even a single person.::
65265::$$$message_0599_0030_0000$$$::"E-eh!? Shirou!?"[lr]::
65266::$$$message_0599_0030_0001$$$::I realize I'm hugging Illya.[lr]::
65267::$$$message_0599_0030_0002$$$::I never made her any promises, nor did she ask for anything.::
65268::$$$message_0599_0031_0000$$$::"Shirou..."[lr]::
65269::$$$message_0599_0031_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65270::$$$message_0599_0031_0002$$$::Her body is small, and I can't hug her too hard.[lr]::
65271::$$$message_0599_0031_0003$$$::It's a one-sided embrace.[lr]::
65272::$$$message_0599_0031_0004$$$::I feel with my own fingers the weight of someone whom I must protect. é»
