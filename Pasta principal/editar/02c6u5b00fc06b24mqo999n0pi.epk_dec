16626::$$$message_0152_0000_0001$$$::I mix onions, panko, sake, egg, salt with four hundred grams of ground beef and pork, and knead it all together.[lr]::
16627::$$$message_0152_0000_0002$$$::I've decided to be bold today, so I'm making stewed Japanese-style hamburg steak for breakfast.::
16628::$$$message_0152_0001_0000$$$::"Rin? Are you awake?"[lr]::
16629::$$$message_0152_0001_0001$$$::Saber's voice drifts out from the living room.[lr]::
16630::$$$message_0152_0001_0002$$$::"Tohsaka?"[lr]::
16631::$$$message_0152_0001_0003$$$::I glance back over my shoulder as I cook.::
16632::$$$message_0152_0002_0000$$$::"Morning. Hey, I'm going to pour myself a cup of milk, Shirou."[lr]::
16633::$$$message_0152_0002_0001$$$::Tohsaka comes in, looking grumpy, and grabs a carton of milk from the fridge.::
16634::$$$message_0152_0003_0000$$$::"Argh. Slept too much. My head hurts... Hey what's this? You're really going all out this morning, aren't you?"[lr]::
16635::$$$message_0152_0003_0001$$$::Where'd that grumpy face she'd been making a second ago go? Her eyes are practically sparkling now.::
16636::$$$message_0152_0004_0000$$$::"Oh that looks good. And here I was starting to get hungry. This is perfect."[lr]::
16637::$$$message_0152_0004_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Is that so?[font italic=false] Well, she's the one who gets to enjoy herself here, not me.[lr]::
16638::$$$message_0152_0004_0002$$$::Reminds me of what my old man used to say: someone gains, someone else loses.::
16639::$$$message_0152_0005_0000$$$::"I've thought this before, but you've got a keen eye."[lr]::
16640::$$$message_0152_0005_0001$$$::"Well, I'm just a discerning sort. Looking forward to this breakfast you're making, though."::
16641::$$$message_0152_0006_0000$$$::She waves as she heads back to the living room.[lr]::
16642::$$$message_0152_0006_0001$$$::With a glass of milk in one hand, Tohsaka plops down at the table.[lr]::
16643::$$$message_0152_0006_0002$$$::...Seriously.[lr]::
16644::$$$message_0152_0006_0003$$$::I don't know where she gets off acting like king of the castle here in [font italic=true]my[font italic=false] house.::
16645::$$$message_0152_0007_0000$$$::"You are certainly lazy today, Rin."[lr]::
16646::$$$message_0152_0007_0001$$$::Yeah, way to go, Saber. She's saying everything I wish I could.[lr]::
16647::$$$message_0152_0007_0002$$$::However...[lr]::
16648::$$$message_0152_0007_0003$$$::Tohsaka dismisses Saber's criticism nonchalantly by just agreeing with her.::
16649::$$$message_0152_0008_0000$$$::"Of course I'm lazy now.[lr]::
16650::$$$message_0152_0008_0001$$$::With Berserker gone, now we just have to deal with Caster, Lancer, and Assassin. They're noting compared to Berserker. Should be a cakewalk for Saber."::
16651::$$$message_0152_0009_0000$$$::"You do not know that. Defeating Lancer and Assassin may not be as straightforward as you think.[lr]::
16652::$$$message_0152_0009_0001$$$::And we have yet to meet Caster."::
16653::$$$message_0152_0010_0000$$$::"Don't be so humble. No ordinary Heroic Spirit is any match for King Arthur.[lr]::
16654::$$$message_0152_0010_0001$$$::We've solved your magical energy problem.[lr]::
16655::$$$message_0152_0010_0002$$$::So there's no Servant who can best you now."[lr]::
16656::$$$message_0152_0010_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
16657::$$$message_0152_0011_0000$$$::Saber narrows her eyes at Tohsaka.[lr]::
16658::$$$message_0152_0011_0001$$$::I have the same reaction.[lr]::
16659::$$$message_0152_0011_0002$$$::We shouldn't let what Tohsaka said there just go by.::
16660::$$$message_0152_0012_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. Do you know who Saber is?"::
16661::$$$message_0152_0013_0000$$$::"I had a hunch, but yesterday confirmed my suspicions. Only one hero can wield a sacred sword like that.[lr]::
16662::$$$message_0152_0013_0001$$$::I mean, I was a little surprised to learn that the legendary King Arthur was a girl, but I can't really argue against that when she's sitting right in front of me."::
16663::$$$message_0152_0014_0000$$$::"Besides, legends are rewritten all the time, right?[lr]::
16664::$$$message_0152_0014_0001$$$::I don't know if Saber was the one who hid it or if the people around her did, but I guess there was a problem with having a girl be king in medieval times.[lr]::
16665::$$$message_0152_0014_0002$$$::So I don't blame them for saying she was a man."::
16666::$$$message_0152_0015_0000$$$::Tohsaka's tone remains the same.[lr]::
16667::$$$message_0152_0015_0001$$$::Saber at least doesn't seem to mind.[lr]::
16668::$$$message_0152_0015_0002$$$::If anything, she seems to agree with Tohsaka. She certainly doesn't seem about to argue.::
16669::$$$message_0152_0016_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
16670::$$$message_0152_0016_0001$$$::She's basically acknowledged the fact.[lr]::
16671::$$$message_0152_0016_0002$$$::A hero with a connection to the sword is selected to be the Saber Servant. Based on that alone, she would absolutely make for the best Saber.::
16672::$$$message_0152_0017_0000$$$::The heroic symbol of Britain.[lr]::
16673::$$$message_0152_0017_0001$$$::The wielder of a sacred sword, so famous she's even known in this faraway land.::
16674::$$$message_0152_0018_0000$$$::...But then, what of it?[lr]::
16675::$$$message_0152_0018_0001$$$::The legend of King Arthur ends with the king's death.[lr]::
16676::$$$message_0152_0018_0002$$$::Even heroes are still human.[lr]::
16677::$$$message_0152_0018_0003$$$::Their stories usually end in death, but no hero dies a proper death.[lr]::
16678::$$$message_0152_0018_0004$$$::King Arthur was no exception.::
16679::$$$message_0152_0019_0000$$$::If I remember correctly, King Arthur died in battle.[lr]::
16680::$$$message_0152_0019_0001$$$::...At the great Battle of Camlann.[lr]::
16681::$$$message_0152_0019_0002$$$::After unifying Britain and supposedly having no more foreign enemies to defeat, King Arthur was drawn into conflict with an unexpected enemy in the end.::
16682::$$$message_0152_0020_0000$$$::It was the treachery of her own army[line2]the knights she vowed to protect and fought alongside for so long[line2]that led to King Arthur's death.::
16683::$$$message_0152_0021_0000$$$::King Arthur defeated the army's leader, but took a fatal wound in the battle, and so entrusted her only surviving knight, Bedivere, with the task of returning the sacred sword to where it belonged.[lr]::
16684::$$$message_0152_0021_0001$$$::[font italic=true]"Travel across this bloody battlefield and over the hill.[font italic=false][lr]::
16685::$$$message_0152_0021_0002$$$::[font italic=true]You will find a deep lake. Throw this sword into that lake."[font italic=false]::
16686::$$$message_0152_0022_0000$$$::But Bedivere did not fulfill that final duty.[lr]::
16687::$$$message_0152_0022_0001$$$::Fearing the implications of losing the sword, Bedivere falsely reported not once, but twice, that he had thrown it into the lake.::
16688::$$$message_0152_0023_0000$$$::Each time, King Arthur once more ordered Bedivere to throw the sword away. Finally, on his third attempt, Bedivere was able to fulfill his king's wishes.[lr]::
16689::$$$message_0152_0023_0001$$$::It is said that King Arthur died after making certain the sword had been returned.::
16690::$$$message_0152_0024_0000$$$::"So, Shirou. What do you plan to do now?"[lr]::
16691::$$$message_0152_0024_0001$$$::...Hm?[lr]::
16692::$$$message_0152_0024_0002$$$::Tohsaka suddenly turns to glare at me.::
16693::$$$message_0152_0025_0000$$$::"Eh? What do you mean...plan to do?"[lr]::
16694::$$$message_0152_0025_0001$$$::"I'm talking about that dangerous girl sleeping in the Japanese-style room right now.[lr]::
16695::$$$message_0152_0025_0002$$$::I told you to leave her alone, but you insisted on carrying her here."::
16696::$$$message_0152_0026_0000$$$::"I also have something to say on the subject. Though she has lost Berserker, Illyasviel remains a dangerous Master. I question your decision to shelter her."[lr]::
16697::$$$message_0152_0026_0001$$$::"Yep. You should just leave her with Kirei."::
16698::$$$message_0152_0027_0000$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
16699::$$$message_0152_0027_0001$$$::The two glare at me as one.[lr]::
16700::$$$message_0152_0027_0002$$$::...That's right.[lr]::
16701::$$$message_0152_0027_0003$$$::The moment Berserker disappeared Illya fainted.[lr]::
16702::$$$message_0152_0027_0004$$$::She showed no sign of waking up, and I couldn't just leave her, so I brought her back home.::
16703::$$$message_0152_0028_0000$$$::Of course, Tohsaka and Saber objected, so I carried her myself.[lr]::
16704::$$$message_0152_0028_0001$$$::A Master who loses their Servant either flees before another Master kills them, or is protected by the Church.[lr]::
16705::$$$message_0152_0028_0002$$$::Tohsaka says we should let Kotomine take care of her, but I don't think that priest would take very good care of Illya, so I'm having her stay in one of our spare rooms.::
16706::$$$message_0152_0029_0000$$$::"Shirou. Your actions here are commendable, but it is dangerous to get involved with Illyasviel. It is not too late. We may either send her to the Church, or seize her Command Spells."::
16707::$$$message_0152_0030_0000$$$::...Hm.[lr]::
16708::$$$message_0152_0030_0001$$$::Saber's serious.[lr]::
16709::$$$message_0152_0030_0002$$$::Changing her mind won't be easy.::
16710::$$$message_0152_0031_0000$$$::"D-do you have a problem? We couldn't just leave her alone.[lr]::
16711::$$$message_0152_0031_0001$$$::Illya's just a kid, and she wasn't herself. I'd feel bad leaving her with Kotomine."::
16712::$$$message_0152_0032_0000$$$::"You'd [font italic=true]feel bad[font italic=false]? How can you say that with a straight face after everything she did to us!?"[lr]::
16713::$$$message_0152_0032_0001$$$::"I agree. You have too much empathy for Illyasviel. She tried to kill you many times."::
16714::$$$message_0152_0033_0000$$$::The two are more united than ever.[lr]::
16715::$$$message_0152_0033_0001$$$::But I need to stand my ground.::
16716::$$$message_0152_0034_0000$$$::"Illya was our enemy, but she never had any malice for us. As long as she has a good influence, she won't do any more harm.[lr]::
16717::$$$message_0152_0034_0001$$$::And I said this at the start.[lr]::
16718::$$$message_0152_0034_0002$$$::I'm not fighting to kill Masters. I'm fighting to end the battle."::
16719::$$$message_0152_0035_0000$$$::"I...know that, but..."[lr]::
16720::$$$message_0152_0035_0001$$$::Saber's tone softens, though she's clearly not convinced.::
16721::$$$message_0152_0036_0000$$$::But...::
16722::$$$message_0152_0037_0000$$$::"Oh yeah? So you're going to forgive Illyasviel for everything she's done. Let me tell you something: she's attacked other Masters, and you don't know how many Masters she might have killed. You're going to save her, even so?"::
16723::$$$message_0152_0038_0000$$$::"Well...I..."[lr]::
16724::$$$message_0152_0038_0001$$$::Yeah.[lr]::
16725::$$$message_0152_0038_0002$$$::Illya admitted she killed Shinji after I let him go.::
16726::$$$message_0152_0039_0000$$$::Shinji used Rider to try to kill everyone at school. If that's what he did as a Master, I suppose his death was inevitable.[lr]::
16727::$$$message_0152_0039_0001$$$::But Shinji was a friend of mine for years, and thinking of Sakura, I can't just write off what Illya did.::
16728::$$$message_0152_0040_0000$$$::"But that means there's no chance at closure.[lr]::
16729::$$$message_0152_0040_0001$$$::Even if Illya's no longer a Master, as long as she can reflect and feel remorse, I think we should save her."::
16730::$$$message_0152_0041_0000$$$::"Okay, you might be right.[lr]::
16731::$$$message_0152_0041_0001$$$::But I, for one, won't ever forgive her for what she did to Archer. She killed my Archer."::
16732::$$$message_0152_0042_0000$$$::We're at an impasse here.[lr]::
16733::$$$message_0152_0042_0001$$$::We all freeze, staring at each other.[lr]::
16734::$$$message_0152_0042_0002$$$::But then...::
16735::$$$message_0152_0043_0000$$$::"Oh come on. All Servants disappear in the end anyway. If you're so worried about that, you fail as a Master, Rin."[lr]::
16736::$$$message_0152_0043_0001$$$::The very girl under discussion appears.::
16737::$$$message_0152_0044_0000$$$::"Illyasviel!"::
16738::$$$message_0152_0045_0000$$$::"Hold it. I have no business with you two. I don't have any intention of fighting, so don't get so angry at me.[lr]::
16739::$$$message_0152_0045_0001$$$::Honestly, I'm embarrassed for you two, just as fellow ladies. You're older than me, but you're sorely lacking in manners."::
16740::$$$message_0152_0046_0000$$$::Illya shrugs, looking disgusted.[lr]::
16741::$$$message_0152_0046_0001$$$::"Wh-what did you say!?"[lr]::
16742::$$$message_0152_0046_0002$$$::Saber and Tohsaka are once again in sync.[lr]::
16743::$$$message_0152_0046_0003$$$::A whole new kind of intensity comes over them.::
16744::$$$message_0152_0047_0000$$$::"Well, I'm not going to get into that with you. I don't have time to deal with the two of you right now."[lr]::
16745::$$$message_0152_0047_0001$$$::Illya turns from them to face me.::
16746::$$$message_0152_0048_0000$$$::"Eh? Illy...a?"[lr]::
16747::$$$message_0152_0048_0001$$$::"I would like to thank you, Master of Saber. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being so concerned about me, even though I was your enemy."::
16748::$$$message_0152_0049_0000$$$::"Uh...huh?"[lr]::
16749::$$$message_0152_0049_0001$$$::I stare at Illya in disbelief.[lr]::
16750::$$$message_0152_0049_0002$$$::So sudden is this that even Saber goes quiet.[lr]::
16751::$$$message_0152_0049_0003$$$::Tohsaka just keeps drinking her milk, giving Illya the stink eye.::
16752::$$$message_0152_0050_0000$$$::   And then...[lr]::
16753::$$$message_0152_0050_0001$$$::Illya smiles that familiar smile of hers.[lr]::
16754::$$$message_0152_0050_0002$$$::"Just kidding![lr]::
16755::$$$message_0152_0050_0003$$$::Yep. You sure are my brother!"[lr]::
16756::$$$message_0152_0050_0004$$$::She launches herself right at me and hugs me around the neck.::
16757::$$$message_0152_0051_0000$$$::"Hrrk!?"[lr]::
16758::$$$message_0152_0051_0001$$$::"Wh-what's going on!?"[lr]::
16759::$$$message_0152_0051_0002$$$::Tohsaka spits out her milk.[lr]::
16760::$$$message_0152_0051_0003$$$::[font italic=true]What the...!?[font italic=false][lr]::
16761::$$$message_0152_0051_0004$$$::I can almost hear the vein popping in Saber's forehead.::
16762::$$$message_0152_0052_0000$$$::"U-unhand him, you insolent fool!"[lr]::
16763::$$$message_0152_0052_0001$$$::Saber rushes toward me.[lr]::
16764::$$$message_0152_0052_0002$$$::Illya twists around, swinging to my back.::
16765::$$$message_0152_0053_0000$$$::"Hmph. Who's being uncivil here? A Servant like you has no right to command me!"[lr]::
16766::$$$message_0152_0053_0001$$$::"I have neither obligation nor intent to obey you! If you will speak so brazenly, then you will remove yourself from Shirou's presence this instant!"::
16767::$$$message_0152_0054_0000$$$::"I'm not listening to you! Hey Shirou, let's do the same thing we did last night! You gave me a piggyback ride, right!?"[lr]::
16768::$$$message_0152_0054_0001$$$::Illya spins around me.[lr]::
16769::$$$message_0152_0054_0002$$$::Saber hurries after her, trying to catch her.::
16770::$$$message_0152_0055_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
16771::$$$message_0152_0055_0001$$$::This is bad.[lr]::
16772::$$$message_0152_0055_0002$$$::What, specifically is bad? Well, it's...just bad.::
16773::$$$message_0152_0056_0000$$$::The two can't stop glaring at each other.[lr]::
16774::$$$message_0152_0056_0001$$$::It must be because Tohsaka is just watching from afar, butâ€¦[lr]::
16775::$$$message_0152_0056_0002$$$::She just wipes the milk off her mouth, as if nothing is happening, and says,::
16776::$$$message_0152_0057_0000$$$::"Look, I don't care what you do, but if you keep that up, you're going to kill him."[lr]::
16777::$$$message_0152_0057_0001$$$::"Eh?"[lr]::
16778::$$$message_0152_0057_0002$$$::The two peer curiously at me.::
16779::$$$message_0152_0058_0000$$$::It's...pretty clear.[lr]::
16780::$$$message_0152_0058_0001$$$::My neck's getting wrenched around. I now face the greatest danger of my life.::
16781::$$$message_0152_0058_0002$$$::Okay. Let's review the current situation.[lr]::
16782::$$$message_0152_0058_0003$$$::The hamburg steak I'd been working so hard on is packed away in the freezer.::
16783::$$$message_0152_0059_0000$$$::First, there's Tohsaka. She's being relatively quiet.[lr]::
16784::$$$message_0152_0059_0001$$$::She seems to be keeping a straight face, and it looks like she's just going to watch things play out, but who can say what she might be thinking to herself...::
16785::$$$message_0152_0060_0000$$$::"Hm? What is it, Shirou?"[lr]::
16786::$$$message_0152_0060_0001$$$::Illya's sitting next to me, and for some reason she looks like she's in a good mood.[lr]::
16787::$$$message_0152_0060_0002$$$::She's looking curiously around the living room, but it doesn't look like Saber or Tohsaka are much concern to her.[lr]::
16788::$$$message_0152_0060_0003$$$::Whatever either of them might say is likely to go in one ear and out the other.::
16789::$$$message_0152_0061_0000$$$::And then there's the one I'm most concerned about...[lr]::
16790::$$$message_0152_0061_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
16791::$$$message_0152_0061_0002$$$::Saber. She's glaring anxiously at both me and Ilya.::
16792::$$$message_0152_0062_0000$$$::She's not usually so fidgety and restless.[lr]::
16793::$$$message_0152_0062_0001$$$::It feels like I'm resting on a bed of nails.[lr]::
16794::$$$message_0152_0062_0002$$$::So I can't leave things like this.[lr]::
16795::$$$message_0152_0062_0003$$$::I don't know what is going to come of this, but I have to do something about the situation.::
16796::$$$message_0152_0063_0000$$$::"Let's settle this.[lr]::
