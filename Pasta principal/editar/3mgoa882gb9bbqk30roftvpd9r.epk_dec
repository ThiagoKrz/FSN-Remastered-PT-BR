16578::$$$message_0150_0000_0001$$$::...::
16579::$$$message_0150_0000_0002$$$::G-good evening everyone![lr]::
16580::$$$message_0150_0000_0003$$$::This is Tiger Dojo, the Q&A spot that helps Shirou when he dies from easily avoided mistakes.::
16581::$$$message_0150_0000_0004$$$::So, the cause of death this time around was...::
16582::$$$message_0150_0000_0005$$$::Uh...the moral of the story here is that you shouldn't ever let down your guard, no matter how much you seem to have the upper hand.::
16583::$$$message_0150_0000_0006$$$::Shirou's a Master, so he needs to control Saber whenever she rushes out so recklessly!::
16584::$$$message_0150_0000_0007$$$::Eh? No, you got it wrong... Saber's at fault this time, right?[lr]::
16585::$$$message_0150_0000_0008$$$::She was the one who fell into Caster's trap. Obviously that means she's losing focus.::
16586::$$$message_0150_0000_0009$$$::I bet she was self-conscious around Shirou and just tried to show off.  But she ended up killing Shirou... Honestly, how the mighty Saber class has fallen.::
16587::$$$message_0150_0000_0010$$$::Ah...panic, panic, panic!::
16588::$$$message_0150_0000_0011$$$::Besides, she may be the strongest, but she hasn't really got much in the way of wins under her belt. She's small. And she lacks charm.::
16589::$$$message_0150_0000_0012$$$::She's just a gluttonous muscle-brain.::
16590::$$$message_0150_0000_0013$$$::Uh...okay now, you can stop, Illya.[lr]::
16591::$$$message_0150_0000_0014$$$::Saber feels bad over the whole thing too. Rubbing salt in someone's wounds isn't very samurai.::
16592::$$$message_0150_0000_0015$$$::Hm. I see. So bushido...the way of a samurai...is all about the lack of opulence...with no love...only sympathy.[lr]::
16593::$$$message_0150_0000_0016$$$::...Fine. I'll let this go.::
16594::$$$message_0150_0000_0017$$$::But the fact of the matter is that Saber needs to be reined in. If you don't, you'll get more of these dead ends.::
16595::$$$message_0150_0000_0018$$$::Sorry to butt in!::
16596::$$$message_0150_0000_0019$$$::Owww... My mentor...what's with the corporal punishment?::
16597::$$$message_0150_0000_0020$$$::I told you already! None of that talk! No spoilers, and don't tick Saber off!::
16598::$$$message_0150_0000_0021$$$::She's really scary if she gets mad! Just the other day, someone had a near-death experience because they made Saber mad.::
16599::$$$message_0150_0000_0022$$$::Oh, you mean the thing that happened on day thirteen.[lr]::
16600::$$$message_0150_0000_0023$$$::That was really fun...::
16601::$$$message_0150_0000_0024$$$::Huh? Taiga? Did you just hear a growling sound?::
16602::$$$message_0150_0000_0025$$$::Huh? I don't think I[line2]::
16603::$$$message_0150_0000_0026$$$::Gyaaawaaahhh![lr]::
16604::$$$message_0150_0000_0027$$$::A-a-a-a-a rival appears! ::
16605::$$$message_0150_0000_0028$$$::Kyaaah![lr]::
16606::$$$message_0150_0000_0029$$$::What the heck!? A weird thing is riding another weird thing...and it's coming right at us!:®¿‰
