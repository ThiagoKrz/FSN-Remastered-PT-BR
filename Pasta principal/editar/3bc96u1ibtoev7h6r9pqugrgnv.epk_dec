55400::$$$message_0491_0000_0000$$$::   I open the door.[lr]::
55401::$$$message_0491_0000_0001$$$::Tohsaka's standing in a corner of the chapel. It looks like she's been here for a while.[lr]::
55402::$$$message_0491_0000_0002$$$::From the way she stands, I can feel a certain determination.[lr]::
55403::$$$message_0491_0000_0003$$$::It's the face of a ruthless mage who has decided to treat Sakura as an enemy if the Crest Worms can't be removed.::
55404::$$$message_0491_0001_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
55405::$$$message_0491_0001_0001$$$::Tohsaka doesn't look at me, and I have nothing to say to her.[lr]::
55406::$$$message_0491_0001_0002$$$::   For a long time, the chapel is filled only with the drumming of the rain.[lr]::
55407::$$$message_0491_0001_0003$$$::I'm not sure how long it goes on for.::
55408::$$$message_0491_0002_0000$$$::"The surgery is finished. There is nothing more I can do."[lr]::
55409::$$$message_0491_0002_0001$$$::Kirei Kotomine appears, breaking the silence.::
55410::$$$message_0491_0003_0000$$$::"Wait, Kirei. What happened to your Magic Crest?"[lr]::
55411::$$$message_0491_0003_0001$$$::"Hm, so you could tell. As you can see, I used them all to heal Sakura Matou."[lr]::
55412::$$$message_0491_0003_0002$$$::"Y-you used them all?"[lr]::
55413::$$$message_0491_0003_0003$$$::Tohsaka gasps.::
55414::$$$message_0491_0004_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
55415::$$$message_0491_0004_0001$$$::I'm not sure what they're talking about.[lr]::
55416::$$$message_0491_0004_0002$$$::All I can tell is that something happened to Kotomine's Magic Crest, and that Tohsaka's really surprised.::
55417::$$$message_0491_0005_0000$$$::"D-do you know what you've done? That's your Magic Crest, you know![lr]::
55418::$$$message_0491_0005_0001$$$::How can you just lose something that's been built up over generations!?"::
55419::$$$message_0491_0006_0000$$$::"I had no other option. The Crest I inherited from my father is not permanent like yours. It is meant to be consumed the more it is used. After all, we were never a family of mages.[lr]::
55420::$$$message_0491_0006_0001$$$::You can just think of them as inferior Command Spells."::
55421::$$$message_0491_0007_0000$$$::"So, is she really..."[lr]::
55422::$$$message_0491_0007_0001$$$::"Yes. I used my entire Crest to heal her. As you know, I had to extract eleven years' worth of corruption. Surely it isn't so surprising that it took the remainder of my Crest to accomplish that."::
55423::$$$message_0491_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55424::$$$message_0491_0008_0001$$$::...Tohsaka and I are speechless.[lr]::
55425::$$$message_0491_0008_0002$$$::The priest used his entire Magic Crest to heal Sakura.[lr]::
55426::$$$message_0491_0008_0003$$$::From the look on Tohsaka's face, I have an inkling of how heavy a price he paid.[lr]::
55427::$$$message_0491_0008_0004$$$::He basically spent his entire life savings to save a girl we carried through the front door.::
55428::$$$message_0491_0009_0000$$$::"Kotomine, you..."[lr]::
55429::$$$message_0491_0009_0001$$$::"What? Don't tell me I've inconvenienced you. You were the ones who asked for help. I simply answered in kind."::
55430::$$$message_0491_0010_0000$$$::"Uh...no, it's not an... inconvenience. Um...thank you."[lr]::
55431::$$$message_0491_0010_0001$$$::"Do not thank me. You will retract those words later, at any rate."[lr]::
55432::$$$message_0491_0010_0002$$$::"I'll retract them later...?"[lr]::
55433::$$$message_0491_0010_0003$$$::Is he saying...::
55434::$$$message_0491_0011_0000$$$::"And how's Sakura doing? If you went that far..."::
55435::$$$message_0491_0012_0000$$$::"She has escaped death, but I've only bought her time.[lr]::
55436::$$$message_0491_0012_0001$$$::I removed most of the Crest Worms, but extracting the most deeply burrowed worms was impossible. There is no way to remove them once they have consumed so much of her nerves. I might be able to remove them completely if we also took out her heart, but that would kill Sakura Matou."::
55437::$$$message_0491_0013_0000$$$::"I've merely alleviated her pain and weakened Zouken's hold by removing the Crest Worms that have yet to fuse with her nerves. On a whim, I extended the life of someone who was fated to die tonight. It will all be in vain once the most deeply implanted worms begin to move."::
55438::$$$message_0491_0014_0000$$$::"So, Sakura is..."[lr]::
55439::$$$message_0491_0014_0001$$$::"Nothing has changed.[lr]::
55440::$$$message_0491_0014_0002$$$::She can continue her daily life, but it could easily go awry if Zouken Matou were to act.[lr]::
55441::$$$message_0491_0014_0003$$$::All it would take is a single thought from the old man to force her to fight against her will. Think of her as a bomb with its fuse already lit."::
55442::$$$message_0491_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55443::$$$message_0491_0015_0001$$$::I'd be lying if I said I didn't have doubts.[lr]::
55444::$$$message_0491_0015_0002$$$::But I'm not surprised, and my mind is certain.[lr]::
55445::$$$message_0491_0015_0003$$$::I was ready for this.[lr]::
55446::$$$message_0491_0015_0004$$$::No matter what shape Sakura is in, no matter what happens to her, I've decided to be on her side.::
55447::$$$message_0491_0016_0000$$$::"Okay. Then there's only one thing left to do. Sorry for making you use up all of your Crests, Kirei."::
55448::$$$message_0491_0017_0000$$$::Tohsaka begins walking away from the wall.[lr]::
55449::$$$message_0491_0017_0001$$$::I realize what she's about to do,[lr]::
55450::$$$message_0491_0017_0002$$$::"Wait, Tohsaka!"[lr]::
55451::$$$message_0491_0017_0003$$$::and grab her by the hand, stopping her.::
55452::$$$message_0491_0018_0000$$$::"What? We can talk later."[lr]::
55453::$$$message_0491_0018_0001$$$::"What the hell are you talking about? Are you planning to kill Sakura?"[lr]::
55454::$$$message_0491_0018_0002$$$::"It's not just a plan, it's our only option. I thought you were prepared for that to happen when you came here."::
