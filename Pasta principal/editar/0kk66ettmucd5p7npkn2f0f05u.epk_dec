23912::$$$message_0210_0000_0000$$$::The moment she reaches the rooftop...[lr]::
23913::$$$message_0210_0000_0001$$$::Saber confronts her opponent's true form.::
23914::$$$message_0210_0001_0000$$$::"Haaa...haaa...ha...ah!!!"[lr]::
23915::$$$message_0210_0001_0001$$$::Saber leans on her sword, exhausted, and looks up.[lr]::
23916::$$$message_0210_0001_0002$$$::The white light rushes toward her.[lr]::
23917::$$$message_0210_0001_0003$$$::Saber unleashes the wind that shrouds her sword, using it to create an invisible barrier.[lr]::
23918::$$$message_0210_0001_0004$$$::She goes flying backward.[lr]::
23919::$$$message_0210_0001_0005$$$::Her attempt to block the onrushing Pegasus fails to even slow it down.::
23920::$$$message_0210_0002_0000$$$::"Gngh...!"[lr]::
23921::$$$message_0210_0002_0001$$$::The force of the impact knocks Saber back, slamming her brutally into the ground.[lr]::
23922::$$$message_0210_0002_0002$$$::   There's no time to be lying down.[lr]::
23923::$$$message_0210_0002_0003$$$::Pegasus turns midair and resumes its glide without so much as pausing.::
23924::$$$message_0210_0003_0000$$$::"Fu...!"[lr]::
23925::$$$message_0210_0003_0001$$$::She can't possibly brace herself.[lr]::
23926::$$$message_0210_0003_0002$$$::Her only option is to try to evade.[lr]::
23927::$$$message_0210_0003_0003$$$::Even if she manages that, the aftereffects of its passage will chip away at her defenses.[lr]::
23928::$$$message_0210_0003_0004$$$::If this keeps up, it [font italic=true]will[font italic=false] hit her eventually.::
23929::$$$message_0210_0004_0000$$$::The white light streaks down toward her.[lr]::
23930::$$$message_0210_0004_0001$$$::Pegasus sails far over head and knocks Saber backward before sweeping back into the skies.[lr]::
23931::$$$message_0210_0004_0002$$$::Saber can't possibly reach it.[lr]::
23932::$$$message_0210_0004_0003$$$::There are no walls she can kick off of, not up here. Even if she could, there's no way she could actually reach Pegasus.::
23933::$$$message_0210_0005_0000$$$::"Ha...haaa...hah...ha..."[lr]::
23934::$$$message_0210_0005_0001$$$::Despite her disadvantage, Saber waits for an opportunity to fight back.[lr]::
23935::$$$message_0210_0005_0002$$$::Pegasus it may be, but it's a living creature, so she should still be able to kill it if she can just get a chance.[lr]::
23936::$$$message_0210_0005_0003$$$::Her only opportunity for victory is if Rider makes a mistake at the reins.::
23937::$$$message_0210_0006_0000$$$::"This is a surprise. You are tougher than I expected."[lr]::
23938::$$$message_0210_0006_0001$$$::Rider's voice comes from high above.[lr]::
23939::$$$message_0210_0006_0002$$$::Saber grips her sword tightly as she looks up.::
23940::$$$message_0210_0007_0000$$$::"But is there any point to any of this? You have no chance of winning. If you're to disappear, I suggest you at least do it gracefully."[lr]::
23941::$$$message_0210_0007_0001$$$::Rider's voice is calm.[lr]::
23942::$$$message_0210_0007_0002$$$::Even so, I hear just the slightest bit of joy in it.::
23943::$$$message_0210_0008_0000$$$::"Hmph. I expected you to have a Phantasmal species, but I didn't expect you to have [font italic=true]this[font italic=false], Rider."::
23944::$$$message_0210_0009_0000$$$::   A Phantasmal species.[lr]::
23945::$$$message_0210_0009_0001$$$::As the name suggests, it refers to creatures which exist within an illusion.[lr]::
23946::$$$message_0210_0009_0002$$$::Humanoids, like faeries and giants...[lr]::
23947::$$$message_0210_0009_0003$$$::Demonic creatures, like oni and dragons.[lr]::
23948::$$$message_0210_0009_0004$$$::If they are considered Mystics, that alone makes them superior to magecraft.::
23949::$$$message_0210_0010_0000$$$::It's the law of nature for Mystics to be destroyed by other, stronger Mystics.[lr]::
23950::$$$message_0210_0010_0001$$$::In the same way magecraft grows in power with knowledge,[lr]::
23951::$$$message_0210_0010_0002$$$::Phantasmal species accumulate power from their longevity.[lr]::
23952::$$$message_0210_0010_0003$$$::Even if a human masters magecraft, the most they can accumulate is about five hundred years' worth of it. [lr]::
23953::$$$message_0210_0010_0004$$$::Take a species that's lived since ancient times. There's just no contest between that and a Mystic that's only five hundred years old.::
23954::$$$message_0210_0011_0000$$$::But it's been a long, long time since humans and Phantasmals existed in the same world.[lr]::
23955::$$$message_0210_0011_0001$$$::The longer the Phantasmal has lived, the further it's distanced itself from this world.[lr]::
23956::$$$message_0210_0011_0002$$$::The only Phantasmal species in the modern world are a scant few hundred years old.[lr]::
23957::$$$message_0210_0011_0003$$$::So, Saber expected the Phantasmal Rider has as her mount to be only a few hundred years old.::
23958::$$$message_0210_0012_0000$$$::"...You must be truly wicked if you thought to bring something from the Age of Gods here, Rider."[lr]::
23959::$$$message_0210_0012_0001$$$::"Yes. I am different from you all. That is, I was merely an enemy for you, and so now I control only the poor things you people cast out in the distant past."::
23960::$$$message_0210_0013_0000$$$::"I see. I knew there was something twisted about you. So you are a demonic spirit rather than a Heroic Spirit."[lr]::
23961::$$$message_0210_0013_0001$$$::"Hmph. Curse me all you want. It doesn't matter. You won't be able to lay so much as a finger on my darling here."[lr]::
23962::$$$message_0210_0013_0002$$$::The Pegasus rests its wings in the air.[lr]::
23963::$$$message_0210_0013_0003$$$::It's a giant arrow, aimed at Saber's heart, ready to fire at a moment's notice.::
23964::$$$message_0210_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
23965::$$$message_0210_0014_0001$$$::She glares at the creature and thinks: [lr]::
23966::$$$message_0210_0014_0002$$$::Pegasus itself is not a powerful Phantasmal species.[lr]::
23967::$$$message_0210_0014_0003$$$::A typical Pegasus is just a Phantasmal that can only match a Demonic Beast in power.[lr]::
23968::$$$message_0210_0014_0004$$$::Were that the case, it would be easy to defeat with Saber's Invisible Air alone.::
23969::$$$message_0210_0015_0000$$$::But it isn't the case.[lr]::
23970::$$$message_0210_0015_0001$$$::That Pegasus has existed since the Age of Gods, and has long since reached the level of a Phantasmal.[lr]::
23971::$$$message_0210_0015_0002$$$::The horse is nearing the level of the dragon race, considered to be the strongest of all Phantasmals.::
23972::$$$message_0210_0016_0000$$$::At the very least, its defenses are probably already at the level of a dragon race...[lr]::
23973::$$$message_0210_0016_0001$$$::...since Pegasus possesses divine protection that exceeds even Saber's, whose magic resistance is unparalleled.[lr]::
23974::$$$message_0210_0016_0002$$$::The way it glides through the air, trailing massive amounts of magical energy, is like a castle wall bearing down on Saber.[lr]::
23975::$$$message_0210_0016_0003$$$::It can't be possible to avoid or repel something like that.::
23976::$$$message_0210_0017_0000$$$::But something else is odd here.[lr]::
23977::$$$message_0210_0017_0001$$$::Rider simply summoned Pegasus, and it has no True Name of its own.[lr]::
23978::$$$message_0210_0017_0002$$$::To Rider, Pegasus is little more than, say, a favorite dagger.[lr]::
23979::$$$message_0210_0017_0003$$$::And [font italic=true]that[font italic=false] means she has yet to use her Noble Phantasm.::
23980::$$$message_0210_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
23981::$$$message_0210_0018_0001$$$::Even in her dire predicament, the possibility of defeat never enters Saber's mind.[lr]::
23982::$$$message_0210_0018_0002$$$::Instead, she thinks her chance will come when Rider really starts to get serious.[lr]::
23983::$$$message_0210_0018_0003$$$::Whatever Rider's Noble Phantasm may be, it'll have no trouble destroying a building like this.[lr]::
23984::$$$message_0210_0018_0004$$$::She just needs to focus on defending herself, on staying alive. Then all she'll have to do is cut Rider down as soon as an opportunity presents itself.::
23985::$$$message_0210_0019_0000$$$::   Yes...[lr]::
23986::$$$message_0210_0019_0001$$$::If only her Master hadn't shown up...::
23987::$$$message_0210_0020_0000$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
23988::$$$message_0210_0020_0001$$$::I look up towards the sky.[lr]::
23989::$$$message_0210_0020_0002$$$::Flapping wings. I hear flapping wings.[lr]::
23990::$$$message_0210_0020_0003$$$::Something, a paler and more blinding white than the light of the moon, hovers over me.::
23991::$$$message_0210_0020_0004$$$::It is...[lr]::
23992::$$$message_0210_0020_0005$$$::A legendary Mystic I've only heard about in myth.::
23993::$$$message_0210_0021_0000$$$::"A...Pegasus...?"[lr]::
23994::$$$message_0210_0021_0001$$$::The identity of Rider's Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
23995::$$$message_0210_0021_0002$$$::Could that be what scorched the rooftop and forced Saber to her knees?[lr]::
23996::$$$message_0210_0021_0003$$$::I see that Rider is, as her class name suggests, riding a horse, tearing across the sky.::
23997::$$$message_0210_0022_0000$$$::"What the...!?"[lr]::
23998::$$$message_0210_0022_0001$$$::I shift my focus from Rider.[lr]::
23999::$$$message_0210_0022_0002$$$::I thought I heard something...[lr]::
24000::$$$message_0210_0022_0003$$$::"Shinji!? I know you're here. Come on out!"::
24001::$$$message_0210_0023_0000$$$::I can't tell how strong Rider is while she's on Pegasus.[lr]::
24002::$$$message_0210_0023_0001$$$::All I can tell is that white fiend has more magical energy in it than a few [font italic=true]hundred[font italic=false] mages could muster.::
24003::$$$message_0210_0024_0000$$$::No wonder the roof is a charred mess.[lr]::
24004::$$$message_0210_0024_0001$$$::That monster can destroy damn near anything around it just by running across it.[lr]::
24005::$$$message_0210_0024_0002$$$::If that thing charges from up in the sky, even Saber won't be able to avoid it.::
24006::$$$message_0210_0025_0000$$$::"Quit hiding! I came here, like you asked. So show yourself!"[lr]::
24007::$$$message_0210_0025_0001$$$::It's a race against time.[lr]::
24008::$$$message_0210_0025_0002$$$::I need to defeat Shinji. If I defeat the Master, Rider will disappear!::
24009::$$$message_0210_0026_0000$$$::"Ha. Haha...ahahaha...ahahahahahahaha!"[lr]::
24010::$$$message_0210_0026_0001$$$::I hear laughter.[lr]::
24011::$$$message_0210_0026_0002$$$::Shinji must be hiding somewhere.::
24012::$$$message_0210_0027_0000$$$::"Shinji!!!"[lr]::
24013::$$$message_0210_0027_0001$$$::"Did you see that, Emiya? This is the difference between my power and yours!"[lr]::
24014::$$$message_0210_0027_0002$$$::Only his voice echoes.::
24015::$$$message_0210_0028_0000$$$::"Kngh...!"[lr]::
24016::$$$message_0210_0028_0001$$$::I fight down my impatience and try to focus on the sound of his laughter.[lr]::
24017::$$$message_0210_0028_0002$$$::...Damn, the wind's so strong![lr]::
24018::$$$message_0210_0028_0003$$$::I can't tell where the laughter's coming from!::
24019::$$$message_0210_0029_0000$$$::"Sucks for you! This is what you get when you try to be all cool and act like it's all under control, dumbass! Now do you understand that you have to go for the kill when you have the chance!?"::
24020::$$$message_0210_0030_0000$$$::"Shinji...!"[lr]::
24021::$$$message_0210_0030_0001$$$::Don't rush.[lr]::
24022::$$$message_0210_0030_0002$$$::Let him talk. Let him talk all he wants. The more he talks, the better chance I have of finding him.::
24023::$$$message_0210_0031_0000$$$::"But I'm not like that. You and your Servant are done for, here and now. But, it's not like we're total strangers, y'know?[lr]::
24024::$$$message_0210_0031_0001$$$::I still owe you one from yesterday, so I'll be merciful, and kill you quickly!"::
24025::$$$message_0210_0032_0000$$$::"...Ngh!"[lr]::
24026::$$$message_0210_0032_0001$$$::    This is bad.[lr]::
24027::$$$message_0210_0032_0002$$$::Pegasus, still high up in the sky, tips its head toward Saber.[lr]::
24028::$$$message_0210_0032_0003$$$::The vortex of magical energy whirls faster, as if it knows no limit.[lr]::
24029::$$$message_0210_0032_0004$$$::If that thing comes at us at full speed, it'll blow the entire roof apart!::
24030::$$$message_0210_0033_0000$$$::"Don't worry, Emiya. You were a bit of a speed bump along the way, but I'll make sure those morons at school join you soon. And if you're still lonely after all that, I'll send Sakura to join you, too!"::
24031::$$$message_0210_0034_0000$$$::"Why you... Shinji!"[lr]::
24032::$$$message_0210_0034_0001$$$::"Go, Rider![lr]::
24033::$$$message_0210_0034_0002$$$::Take the woman first. Don't leave a trace!"::
24034::$$$message_0210_0035_0000$$$::"Gn...Saber!!!"[lr]::
24035::$$$message_0210_0035_0001$$$::A white comet streaks toward us.[lr]::
24036::$$$message_0210_0035_0002$$$::And at that moment...[lr]::
24037::$$$message_0210_0035_0003$$$::...a storm rages around me.::
24038::$$$message_0210_0036_0000$$$::"Saber!!!"[lr]::
24039::$$$message_0210_0036_0001$$$::"What...!?"[lr]::
24040::$$$message_0210_0036_0002$$$::For the first time, she forgets her enemy in battle.[lr]::
24041::$$$message_0210_0036_0003$$$::She is furious with her Master for walking into this death trap.[lr]::
24042::$$$message_0210_0036_0004$$$::But she's also angry with herself for failing to anticipate him doing so.::
24043::$$$message_0210_0037_0000$$$::All those thoughts are cast aside now.[lr]::
24044::$$$message_0210_0037_0001$$$::What else can she do?[lr]::
24045::$$$message_0210_0037_0002$$$::Even now, even in the midst of danger, she can see only concern for her well-being in his eyes.::
24046::$$$message_0210_0038_0000$$$::"Shirou..."[lr]::
24047::$$$message_0210_0038_0001$$$::   He's always been like this, actually...[lr]::
24048::$$$message_0210_0038_0002$$$::He may have understood that she was an exceptional knight...[lr]::
24049::$$$message_0210_0038_0003$$$::...but that's never how he saw her.::
24050::$$$message_0210_0039_0000$$$::"It appears playtime is over, Saber."[lr]::
24051::$$$message_0210_0039_0001$$$::Rider's giggling voice reaches her even now.[lr]::
24052::$$$message_0210_0039_0002$$$::Rider touches Pegasus's neck with both her hands, and the beast's wings beat harder.::
24053::$$$message_0210_0040_0000$$$::"My Noble Phantasm is powerful, but it is not suitable to be used on the ground. If I use it, it will draw attention. With other Masters still around, I could not do so readily.[lr]::
24054::$$$message_0210_0040_0001$$$::But up here, there is no cause for worry.[lr]::
24055::$$$message_0210_0040_0002$$$::Did you understand that I bought you up here because it suited me?"::
24056::$$$message_0210_0041_0000$$$::Something begins to form in Rider's hands.[lr]::
24057::$$$message_0210_0041_0001$$$::It seems insignificant, really: a glittering, golden rope.::
24058::$$$message_0210_0042_0000$$$::"Is that your Noble Phantasm, Rider?"[lr]::
24059::$$$message_0210_0042_0001$$$::"Yes. Distasteful though it is...[lr]::
24060::$$$message_0210_0042_0002$$$::My darling here is too kind, not fit for battle. And so I need something like this to get them in the mood."[lr]::
24061::$$$message_0210_0042_0003$$$::Pegasus lowers its head.[lr]::
24062::$$$message_0210_0042_0004$$$::This feral nature is not inborn within the creature itself, but coaxed from it by Rider's touch.::
24063::$$$message_0210_0043_0000$$$::"Begone, Saber.[lr]::
24064::$$$message_0210_0043_0001$$$::Even if you survive, your Master has no chance. So long as your Master dies, you will follow him. No?"::
24065::$$$message_0210_0044_0000$$$::It is the inarguable truth.[lr]::
24066::$$$message_0210_0044_0001$$$::Rider's Noble Phantasm will utterly destroy the roof.[lr]::
24067::$$$message_0210_0044_0002$$$::If she hurried, she might be able to carry Shirou away and escape, but Rider won't stop at just destroying the rooftop.[lr]::
24068::$$$message_0210_0044_0003$$$::Her Master is not strong enough to survive a collapsing building.[lr]::
24069::$$$message_0210_0044_0004$$$::Meaning, to protect her Master...[lr]::
24070::$$$message_0210_0044_0005$$$::...she will have to destroy her enemy, Pegasus and all.::
24071::$$$message_0210_0045_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
24072::$$$message_0210_0045_0001$$$::She doesn't have time to think about whether this is the right thing to do.[lr]::
24073::$$$message_0210_0045_0002$$$::Saber glances one final time at her Master, still some distance from her.[lr]::
24074::$$$message_0210_0045_0003$$$::He is doing his best to fill his role simply by gritting his teeth and keeping back.::
24075::$$$message_0210_0046_0000$$$::"O wind..."[lr]::
24076::$$$message_0210_0046_0001$$$::The last of her hesitation fades.[lr]::
24077::$$$message_0210_0046_0002$$$::What is ahead no longer matters.[lr]::
24078::$$$message_0210_0046_0003$$$::All that matters is this moment. And in it, she must be her Master's blade, and defeat the enemy they now face.::
24079::$$$message_0210_0047_0000$$$::"Go, Rider! Get that woman first. Don't leave any trace of her!"[lr]::
24080::$$$message_0210_0047_0001$$$::I hear the jarring, grating shout.[lr]::
24081::$$$message_0210_0047_0002$$$::In that moment, Pegasus ascends higher...::
24082::$$$message_0210_0047_0003$$$::...and vanishes from sight.[lr]::
24083::$$$message_0210_0047_0004$$$::Pegasus flies up into the air; it's already lost its form.[lr]::
24084::$$$message_0210_0047_0005$$$::It rises up as if to shoot through the moon, and then continues its arc by flapping its wings, powering itself down toward the ground.::
24085::$$$message_0210_0047_0006$$$::The blazing white comet streaks downward.[lr]::
24086::$$$message_0210_0047_0007$$$::It becomes an arrow of searing white light, but Rider continues urging it on.[lr]::
24087::$$$message_0210_0047_0008$$$::There's only one target.[lr]::
24088::$$$message_0210_0047_0009$$$::It intends to annihilate its enemy entirely...and the isolated garden in the sky along with it!::
24089::$$$message_0210_0048_0000$$$::"Bellero..."[lr]::
24090::$$$message_0210_0048_0001$$$::She speaks his name.[lr]::
24091::$$$message_0210_0048_0002$$$::If a Noble Phantasm is the miracle that is released by speaking its True Name...[lr]::
24092::$$$message_0210_0048_0003$$$::"...phon!!!"[lr]::
24093::$$$message_0210_0048_0004$$$::It is divine lightning.::
24094::$$$message_0210_0049_0000$$$::A thunderous flash.[lr]::
24095::$$$message_0210_0049_0001$$$::There is no emotion in her eyes as she looks on.[lr]::
24096::$$$message_0210_0049_0002$$$::"You said nobody would see from this vantage, didn't you, Rider!?"[lr]::
24097::$$$message_0210_0049_0003$$$::The wind unfurls from her blade...[lr]::
24098::$$$message_0210_0049_0004$$$::...and becomes a storm.[lr]::
24099::$$$message_0210_0049_0005$$$::"I agree. There's no need to worry about destroying the ground from so high up!"::
24100::$$$message_0210_0050_0000$$$::The seal is broken.[lr]::
24101::$$$message_0210_0050_0001$$$::Layers of wind unfold from her blade.[lr]::
24102::$$$message_0210_0050_0002$$$::Her sword is finally visible.::
24103::$$$message_0210_0051_0000$$$::A storm rages before my eyes.[lr]::
24104::$$$message_0210_0051_0001$$$::The white light descends upon the rooftop.[lr]::
24105::$$$message_0210_0051_0002$$$::Saber, though she is the sole focus of that light, doesn't move.::
24106::$$$message_0210_0052_0000$$$::"Sa...ber!?"[lr]::
24107::$$$message_0210_0052_0001$$$::The raging wind... She's the source.[lr]::
24108::$$$message_0210_0052_0002$$$::No, not Saber herself. Her [font italic=true]sword[font italic=false]!::
24109::$$$message_0210_0053_0000$$$::"...Eh?"[lr]::
24110::$$$message_0210_0053_0001$$$::I can't believe what I'm seeing.[lr]::
24111::$$$message_0210_0053_0002$$$::The blade should be invisible, but there it is.[lr]::
24112::$$$message_0210_0053_0003$$$::Like unwrapping bandages, the wind slowly coils away from her blade.::
24113::$$$message_0210_0054_0000$$$::"A golden...sword!?"::
24114::$$$message_0210_0055_0000$$$::The wind rages on.[lr]::
24115::$$$message_0210_0055_0001$$$::The multiple layers of seals peel away.[lr]::
24116::$$$message_0210_0055_0002$$$::The bands of wind dissolve into the air.[lr]::
24117::$$$message_0210_0055_0003$$$::She readies her now-visible sword and turns back towards Pegasus as it dives towards her.::
24118::$$$message_0210_0056_0000$$$::Rider approaches as a brilliant flare of light.[lr]::
24119::$$$message_0210_0056_0001$$$::Bellerophon is now large enough to engulf the entire rooftop, and is only picking up speed to destroy us, building and all.::
24120::$$$message_0210_0057_0000$$$::The Bridle of Chivalry lights up the rooftop.[lr]::
24121::$$$message_0210_0057_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
24122::$$$message_0210_0057_0002$$$::Time stops.[lr]::
24123::$$$message_0210_0057_0003$$$::In the face of inescapable destruction, my mind goes blank.[lr]::
24124::$$$message_0210_0057_0004$$$::But the light...[lr]::
24125::$$$message_0210_0057_0005$$$::...is not coming from the Bridle of Chivalry.::
24126::$$$message_0210_0058_0000$$$::The light churns and builds upon itself.[lr]::
24127::$$$message_0210_0058_0001$$$::The light of Rider's mount is brilliant, but it can't hold a candle to the purity I see in this one…[lr]::
24128::$$$message_0210_0058_0002$$$::Saber is holding...[lr]::
24129::$$$message_0210_0058_0003$$$::...the ultimate sacred sword that has collected the lights of the stars.::
24130::$$$message_0210_0059_0000$$$::"EX...[wsay canskip=1]::
24131::$$$message_0210_0059_0001$$$::...CALIBUR!!!"::
24132::$$$message_0210_0060_0000$$$::   A single line of brilliant light.::
24133::$$$message_0210_0061_0000$$$::It's...a blade of light, shearing through everything it touches.[lr]::
24134::$$$message_0210_0061_0001$$$::The beam of light destroys Rider utterly as it cleaves through the clouds and disappears into the night sky.[lr]::
24135::$$$message_0210_0061_0002$$$::Most likely...[lr]::
24136::$$$message_0210_0061_0003$$$::...if that sword had been used on the ground, it would have carved a trail of devastation through the city.::
24137::$$$message_0210_0062_0000$$$::Her sword is not "unseeable."[lr]::
24138::$$$message_0210_0062_0001$$$::It simply does not reveal itself.[lr]::
24139::$$$message_0210_0062_0002$$$::It is the golden sword that captivates all who behold it, with a True Name of surpassing fame.::
24140::$$$message_0210_0063_0000$$$::Excalibur...the Sword of Promised Victory.[lr]::
24141::$$$message_0210_0063_0001$$$::A sword that is said to have existed in England; a sword wielded by the king who has become the very symbol of knighthood.[lr]::
24142::$$$message_0210_0063_0002$$$::The strongest of the Servants' Noble Phantasms, sealed by several Bounded Fields.[lr]::
24143::$$$message_0210_0063_0003$$$::That is Saber's proof of her place as a hero.::
24144::$$$message_0210_0064_0000$$$::Silence falls over the rooftop.[lr]::
24145::$$$message_0210_0064_0001$$$::The wind has died down, and not so much as a breeze whispers across the rooftop.::
24146::$$$message_0210_0065_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
24147::$$$message_0210_0065_0001$$$::I stand, dazed, in place. I can't approach Saber.[lr]::
24148::$$$message_0210_0065_0002$$$::I'm still too confused to act...or maybe I'm just captivated by her sword.[lr]::
24149::$$$message_0210_0065_0003$$$::My mind is racing, and I can't seem to think of much that makes sense.::
24150::$$$message_0210_0066_0000$$$::Why does she have that sword?[lr]::
24151::$$$message_0210_0066_0001$$$::That golden sword belongs to a famous, knightly king. Everyone knows who...[lr]::
24152::$$$message_0210_0066_0002$$$::As I try to figure out how she came to have something like that, I realize my mind is doing everything it can to deny the simplest of the possible answers.::
24153::$$$message_0210_0067_0000$$$::...I don't need to be making all these assumptions.[lr]::
24154::$$$message_0210_0067_0001$$$::That sword's always been hers.[lr]::
24155::$$$message_0210_0067_0002$$$::And that's why her True Name is so easy to figure out.[lr]::
24156::$$$message_0210_0067_0003$$$::The owner of that sacred sword can have only one name.::
24157::$$$message_0210_0068_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
24158::$$$message_0210_0068_0001$$$::Saber remains motionless where she stands.[lr]::
24159::$$$message_0210_0068_0002$$$::I should approach her, but my body won't listen.::
24160::$$$message_0210_0069_0000$$$::I've been told so many times that Saber is a Heroic Spirit.[lr]::
24161::$$$message_0210_0069_0001$$$::But now that I've seen for myself that she is indeed a great hero of the past, I hesitate to even get closer to her.::
24162::$$$message_0210_0070_0000$$$::"Aaagh!"[lr]::
24163::$$$message_0210_0070_0001$$$::I hear a shriek.[lr]::
24164::$$$message_0210_0070_0002$$$::Something is burning in the shadows.::
24165::$$$message_0210_0071_0000$$$::I turn to look.[lr]::
24166::$$$message_0210_0071_0001$$$::I see a burning book, slowly dissolving into a pile of ash, and...::
24167::$$$message_0210_0072_0000$$$::"Ah...ah...aaaahhh!!! It's burning! My Command Spells are burning...!"[lr]::
24168::$$$message_0210_0072_0001$$$::I see Shinji cringing as he watches the book burn.::
24169::$$$message_0210_0073_0000$$$::"...Shinji."[lr]::
24170::$$$message_0210_0073_0001$$$::"Aaagh! Ha...ah..."[lr]::
24171::$$$message_0210_0073_0002$$$::He must have realized how much trouble he's in now that Rider has been defeated.[lr]::
24172::$$$message_0210_0073_0003$$$::Shinji turns and sprints toward the exit from the rooftop.::
24173::$$$message_0210_0074_0000$$$::"Hey!"[lr]::
24174::$$$message_0210_0074_0001$$$::He leaps through the door to the stairway.[lr]::
24175::$$$message_0210_0074_0002$$$::"Wait, Shinji!"::
24176::$$$message_0210_0075_0000$$$::I can't let him get away again.[lr]::
24177::$$$message_0210_0075_0001$$$::The moment I turn to pursue Shinji...[lr]::
24178::$$$message_0210_0075_0002$$$::...just out of the corner of my eye...[lr]::
24179::$$$message_0210_0075_0003$$$::...I see Saber collapse.::
24180::$$$message_0210_0076_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
24181::$$$message_0210_0076_0001$$$::My mind stops.[lr]::
24182::$$$message_0210_0076_0002$$$::Shinji is fleeing, and Saber has fallen to the ground.[lr]::
24183::$$$message_0210_0076_0003$$$::I should...[lr]::
