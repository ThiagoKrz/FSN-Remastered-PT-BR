70564::$$$message_0647_0001_0000$$$::Fire blazes as if to connect heaven and earth.[lr]::
70565::$$$message_0647_0001_0001$$$::Flickering flames illuminate the dark cave,[lr]::
70566::$$$message_0647_0001_0002$$$::searing the canopy above.[lr]::
70567::$$$message_0647_0001_0003$$$::But this is no godly shrine.[lr]::
70568::$$$message_0647_0001_0004$$$::The "sky" it connects to is deep underground,[lr]::
70569::$$$message_0647_0001_0005$$$::and the burning torch is black, not red.[lr]::
70570::$$$message_0647_0001_0006$$$::The air is murky, the wind is stagnant, and the water oozing down the walls is the color of poison.::
70571::$$$message_0647_0002_0000$$$::This underground kingdom is said to have been the lair of a dragon. In fact, it is modeled after the stomach of a dragon.[lr]::
70572::$$$message_0647_0002_0001$$$::None who visit this place are human.[lr]::
70573::$$$message_0647_0002_0002$$$::Those who seek salvation in this otherwordly realm, who rejoice in this bizarre sight, must only be the sort of demons who flee the light of the sun.::
70574::$$$message_0647_0003_0000$$$::"GUH..."[lr]::
70575::$$$message_0647_0003_0001$$$::A skull-masked face chokes in the midst of the realm.[lr]::
70576::$$$message_0647_0003_0002$$$::Lit by dark crimson, he is the Servant Assassin, who lost his Master to Kirei Kotomine.::
70577::$$$message_0647_0004_0000$$$::"I suppose this is as far as I go. My body can no longer last without magical energy."[lr]::
70578::$$$message_0647_0004_0001$$$::The white skull creeps along a wall.[lr]::
70579::$$$message_0647_0004_0002$$$::Ahead of him stands a girl.[lr]::
70580::$$$message_0647_0004_0003$$$::Dressed in black curses, she stares absently at the approaching skull::
70581::$$$message_0647_0005_0000$$$::"Tsss... Finally here.[lr]::
70582::$$$message_0647_0005_0001$$$::Lord Mage. I do not see you, but are you alive?"[lr]::
70583::$$$message_0647_0005_0002$$$::He stops five or six meters from the girl.[lr]::
70584::$$$message_0647_0005_0003$$$::Stuck to a wall like a spider, Assassin calls out into the void.::
70585::$$$message_0647_0006_0000$$$::"...Yes. Well met, Assassin."[lr]::
70586::$$$message_0647_0006_0001$$$::Finally, someone answers.[lr]::
70587::$$$message_0647_0006_0002$$$::The old mage's voice rings out in the void.[lr]::
70588::$$$message_0647_0006_0003$$$::The old man should have been eliminated by Kirei, but here he is, alive and well.::
70589::$$$message_0647_0007_0000$$$::It is only logical.[lr]::
70590::$$$message_0647_0007_0001$$$::The Zouken Matou which was crushed in the forest was no more than a swarm of worms.[lr]::
70591::$$$message_0647_0007_0002$$$::His real body which anchors his soul to the world sleeps elsewhere, in a safe location.[lr]::
70592::$$$message_0647_0007_0003$$$::Even the priest's holy words cannot destroy the old mage, as long as the insects that comprise his real body remain intact.::
70593::$$$message_0647_0008_0000$$$::"It does pain me to lose my limbs and all. I can't even send you magical energy right now. And it would be difficult to gather a new body on the surface.[lr]::
70594::$$$message_0647_0008_0001$$$::...Hm. This will be an ordeal, but perhaps it's time. Sakura, make a contract with Assassin. We need a new bodyguard now after you lost Berserker."[lr]::
70595::$$$message_0647_0008_0002$$$::The old mage intones an order.[lr]::
70596::$$$message_0647_0008_0003$$$::The black cursed girl, Sakura Matou, doesn't respond.[lr]::
70597::$$$message_0647_0008_0004$$$::She ignores the absolute authority of the old man and continues staring out into space with lightless eyes.::
70598::$$$message_0647_0009_0000$$$::"...What are you doing, Sakura? Are you going to disobey me?"[lr]::
70599::$$$message_0647_0009_0001$$$::A threatening current runs beneath his irritated tone.[lr]::
70600::$$$message_0647_0009_0002$$$::The old man is slightly on edge.[lr]::
70601::$$$message_0647_0009_0003$$$::He is angry at the girl's ineptitude for losing Berserker and letting Illyasviel slip away.::
70602::$$$message_0647_0010_0000$$$::"...Sakura. I will say it one more time. Are you going to disobey me?"[lr]::
70603::$$$message_0647_0010_0001$$$::Cold contempt.[lr]::
70604::$$$message_0647_0010_0002$$$::The girl has never defied the old man when he speaks like that.[lr]::
70605::$$$message_0647_0010_0003$$$::Not out of fear, but because his dominance is absolute.[lr]::
70606::$$$message_0647_0010_0004$$$::She does fear him, of course.[lr]::
70607::$$$message_0647_0010_0005$$$::But she is literally unable to defy him.[lr]::
70608::$$$message_0647_0010_0006$$$::Reason being, her heart is...::
70609::$$$message_0647_0011_0000$$$::"Wait, Lord Mage. I think her mind is broken. She had to take in so much. A feeble girl could not be expected to survive."[lr]::
70610::$$$message_0647_0011_0001$$$::"...Hm?"[lr]::
70611::$$$message_0647_0011_0002$$$::The old man's irritation vanishes.[lr]::
70612::$$$message_0647_0011_0003$$$::...He returns to calm silence.[lr]::
70613::$$$message_0647_0011_0004$$$::In this dark crimson pit, there is a sound of a slithering worm.::
70614::$$$message_0647_0012_0000$$$::"Hmm. It appears so. I thought she'd hold out a while longer. How anticlimactic."[lr]::
70615::$$$message_0647_0012_0001$$$::The old mage sounds both disappointed and utterly enthused.[lr]::
70616::$$$message_0647_0012_0002$$$::The girl doesn't answer.[lr]::
70617::$$$message_0647_0012_0003$$$::Her mind has been swallowed by the darkness.::
70618::$$$message_0647_0013_0000$$$::"Then will you take her, as planned?"[lr]::
70619::$$$message_0647_0013_0001$$$::"You make it sound so terrible. I did not plan for this. It is the only option left. Sakura Matou's mind is gone. She won't be able to control that monster now.[lr]::
70620::$$$message_0647_0013_0002$$$::I know it is cruel, but I have no choice but to eat my empty granddaughter."[lr]::
70621::$$$message_0647_0013_0003$$$::He snickers.[lr]::
70622::$$$message_0647_0013_0004$$$::The laughter comes from the girl's throat.[lr]::
70623::$$$message_0647_0013_0005$$$::The old mage is laughing using the empty Sakura's vocal cords.::
70624::$$$message_0647_0014_0000$$$::"Then you should hurry. Without magical energy, my body is about to fade away."[lr]::
70625::$$$message_0647_0014_0001$$$::"Hm, yes. Let's begin, then.[lr]::
70626::$$$message_0647_0014_0002$$$::It's really too bad, Sakura. I wanted to let you have the glory of acquiring the Holy Grail after you did such a good job raising that thing. Oh, well.[lr]::
70627::$$$message_0647_0014_0003$$$::If you must blame anyone, blame yourself for delaying the ritual when you let Illyasviel escape.::
70628::$$$message_0647_0015_0000$$$::A crunching sound.[lr]::
70629::$$$message_0647_0015_0001$$$::A worm wriggles its way into the girl's neck.[lr]::
70630::$$$message_0647_0015_0002$$$::It can't be seen.[lr]::
70631::$$$message_0647_0015_0003$$$::There is no worm crawling under her skin.[lr]::
70632::$$$message_0647_0015_0004$$$::   Not from the outside.[lr]::
70633::$$$message_0647_0015_0005$$$::There was never any escape for the girl, not from the twisted thoughts nestled against her heart.::
70634::$$$message_0647_0016_0000$$$::Zouken Matou, insect-user.[lr]::
70635::$$$message_0647_0016_0001$$$::His real body, the host for his decaying soul, is the pseudo-nerves enervating Sakura Matou's heart.::
70636::$$$message_0647_0017_0000$$$::"Kuh. Your body hasn't fully changed, but I won't complain. I will simply take command in place of its absent owner.[lr]::
70637::$$$message_0647_0017_0001$$$::Goodbye, Sakura. You were quite durable for a test subject. You entertained me quite well...!"[lr]::
70638::$$$message_0647_0017_0002$$$::There is a slippery sound of wriggling blood vessels.[lr]::
70639::$$$message_0647_0017_0003$$$::Zouken Matou's rotten spiritual body orders his worm body to eat the girl's brain.::
70640::$$$message_0647_0018_0000$$$::But...::
70641::$$$message_0647_0019_0000$$$::"There's no need for that, Grandfather. I'm perfectly fine."::
70642::$$$message_0647_0020_0000$$$::The girl places a hand on her chest and opens her eyes.::
70643::$$$message_0647_0021_0000$$$::"Oh? I thought it swallowed you, but you're still hanging on... Very well. Sakura, the situation has changed somewhat. I can no longer maintain Assassin.[lr]::
70644::$$$message_0647_0021_0001$$$::It will put a burden on you, but make a new contract with Assassin in my place."[lr]::
70645::$$$message_0647_0021_0002$$$::The old mage issues a command as he always does.[lr]::
70646::$$$message_0647_0021_0003$$$::However, the girl shakes her head in denial.::
70647::$$$message_0647_0022_0000$$$::"...What is the meaning of this, Sakura?"[lr]::
70648::$$$message_0647_0022_0001$$$::"I told you, Grandfather. That won't be necessary."[lr]::
70649::$$$message_0647_0022_0002$$$::Her icy voice rings in the gloom.[lr]::
70650::$$$message_0647_0022_0003$$$::Suddenly,[lr]::
70651::$$$message_0647_0022_0004$$$::the white skull on the wall is swallowed by something dark and enormous.::
70652::$$$message_0647_0023_0000$$$::"Geeeh!?"[lr]::
70653::$$$message_0647_0023_0001$$$::"What!?"[lr]::
70654::$$$message_0647_0023_0002$$$::Their astonishment comes too late.[lr]::
70655::$$$message_0647_0023_0003$$$::Assassin's entire body is compressed in a single attack, leaving only his mask intact.[lr]::
70656::$$$message_0647_0023_0004$$$::"GAH... AHH, AHHHHHHHH!?"[lr]::
70657::$$$message_0647_0023_0005$$$::The mask falls.[lr]::
70658::$$$message_0647_0023_0006$$$::Beneath the white mask, where his face should be,[lr]::
70659::$$$message_0647_0023_0007$$$::is only another skull.::
70660::$$$message_0647_0024_0000$$$::"Hehe. That's it? I was wondering what his face would look like, but he never had a face at all.[lr]::
70661::$$$message_0647_0024_0001$$$::What a boring person. You weren't hiding your face. You just wanted everyone to think that you had one."[lr]::
70662::$$$message_0647_0024_0002$$$::"Geeh...DAMN YOU, girl..."[lr]::
70663::$$$message_0647_0024_0003$$$::"You lost your face, threw away your name, and you still want eternity. But too bad. If you want eternity, you should wish to live forever like Grandfather.[lr]::
70664::$$$message_0647_0024_0004$$$::Even the Holy Grail can't go back in time and give you back a name that you lost."::
70665::$$$message_0647_0025_0000$$$::"Disappear, lord of the mountain. You're nobody, just an assassin. You will never be a true Hassan."[lr]::
70666::$$$message_0647_0025_0001$$$::"GEEEH, GYAAAAAAAAAARRRRGH!!!"[lr]::
70667::$$$message_0647_0025_0002$$$::The shadows swallow his death cry.[lr]::
70668::$$$message_0647_0025_0003$$$::The skull-masked Assassin is devoured without a trace.::
70669::$$$message_0647_0026_0000$$$::"Guh... Have you lost your mind!? What are you doing, you fool!?"[lr]::
70670::$$$message_0647_0026_0001$$$::The old man's confusion borders on madness.[lr]::
70671::$$$message_0647_0026_0002$$$::Is he shocked by the sudden development, or being driven mad by indescribable terror?::
70672::$$$message_0647_0027_0000$$$::The girl laughs at the old man who used to control her.[lr]::
70673::$$$message_0647_0027_0001$$$::"He attacked Senpai twice, you know.[lr]::
70674::$$$message_0647_0027_0002$$$::That's why I killed him. After all, I'm the only one allowed to hurt Senpai."[lr]::
70675::$$$message_0647_0027_0003$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
70676::$$$message_0647_0027_0004$$$::"And Grandfather, you don't need him to protect you anymore. I felt bad for him, so I wanted to give him a vacation."::
70677::$$$message_0647_0028_0000$$$::Then, there is a wet sound.[lr]::
70678::$$$message_0647_0028_0001$$$::The girl plunges her fingers into her own body, tearing out the worm burrowed deep inside, in an act of psychic surgery.::
70679::$$$message_0647_0029_0000$$$::"Nnngh!!!"[lr]::
70680::$$$message_0647_0029_0001$$$::What to call this terror, this confusion?[lr]::
70681::$$$message_0647_0029_0002$$$::The girl gouges out her own body, tearing her own nerves to shreds, all while giggling coolly.::
70682::$$$message_0647_0030_0000$$$::"Wha... What are you doing, Sakura!?"[lr]::
70683::$$$message_0647_0030_0001$$$::He wriggles.[lr]::
70684::$$$message_0647_0030_0002$$$::With lightless eyes, the girl examines the thing that is her grandfather, the thing calling itself her grandfather, the thing that seems to have been her grandfather.::
70685::$$$message_0647_0031_0000$$$::"Oh. That was easy. I always thought you'd be bigger, Grandfather."[lr]::
70686::$$$message_0647_0031_0001$$$::In fact, the worm serving as Zouken Matou's main body was not always this diminutive.[lr]::
70687::$$$message_0647_0031_0002$$$::The old mage changed his host to a more suitable worm in order to parasitize the girl's heart.[lr]::
70688::$$$message_0647_0031_0003$$$::To do that it needed to be smaller than a heart.[lr]::
70689::$$$message_0647_0031_0004$$$::In retrospect, his eccentric taste turned out to be his downfall.::
70690::$$$message_0647_0032_0000$$$::"Sakura...Sakura, how dare..."[lr]::
70691::$$$message_0647_0032_0001$$$::"I should thank that priest. If he hadn't erased the rest of you, you might have really eaten me."::
70692::$$$message_0647_0033_0000$$$::She's seen right through him.[lr]::
70693::$$$message_0647_0033_0001$$$::No, this was inevitable from the beginning.[lr]::
70694::$$$message_0647_0033_0002$$$::The old mage never bothered to hide his objective, and the girl could not defy his will.[lr]::
70695::$$$message_0647_0033_0003$$$::So there was no problem.[lr]::
70696::$$$message_0647_0033_0004$$$::He only ever treated her as his eventual replacement body.[lr]::
70697::$$$message_0647_0033_0005$$$::So... she only had to wait until it was time to raise the flag of rebellion.::
70698::$$$message_0647_0034_0000$$$::"W-wait. Wait, wait, wait![lr]::
70699::$$$message_0647_0034_0001$$$::It's not what you think, Sakura! Taking over your body was the last resort. As long as your mind was intact, I was going to let you have the gate. I just want the Matous to have the glory.[lr]::
70700::$$$message_0647_0034_0002$$$::You win, and you can have everything now, Sakura...!"::
70701::$$$message_0647_0035_0000$$$::The worm wriggles.[lr]::
70702::$$$message_0647_0035_0001$$$::She gently smiles at the filthy creature between her fingers.::
70703::$$$message_0647_0036_0000$$$::"That's all the more reason to do this. I don't need you anymore, Grandfather. Now I can open the gate on my own."::
70704::$$$message_0647_0037_0000$$$::Something inconceivable is happening.[lr]::
70705::$$$message_0647_0037_0001$$$::The old mage made only one mistake.::
70706::$$$message_0647_0038_0000$$$::"...! Wait! I said wait, Sakura...![lr]::
70707::$$$message_0647_0038_0001$$$::I was doing this for your sake, you know![lr]::
70708::$$$message_0647_0038_0002$$$::How, how could you betray your debt to[line2]"::
70709::$$$message_0647_0039_0000$$$::"Goodbye, Grandfather.[lr]::
70710::$$$message_0647_0039_0001$$$::You must be tired after spending two hundred years underground.[lr]::
70711::$$$message_0647_0039_0002$$$::Now you can disappear."::
70712::$$$message_0647_0039_0003$$$::The old man raised the girl [font italic=true]too[font italic=false] well.[lr]::
70713::$$$message_0647_0039_0004$$$::He failed to notice the darkness within her and mistook it for purity.::
70714::$$$message_0647_0040_0000$$$::...Only the girl remains at the altar.[lr]::
70715::$$$message_0647_0040_0001$$$::The flickering black blaze delights in the girl's independence, a personification of itself.::
70716::$$$message_0647_0041_0000$$$::"...Heh."[lr]::
70717::$$$message_0647_0041_0001$$$::The dark girl looks at the blood slicking her hand.[lr]::
70718::$$$message_0647_0041_0002$$$::"Hehe... Heheh, ahahahahaha!"[lr]::
70719::$$$message_0647_0041_0003$$$::She stands there emptily, like a puppet with its strings cut, her laugh echoing on and on.:«—©
