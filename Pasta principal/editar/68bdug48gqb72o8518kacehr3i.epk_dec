48376::$$$message_0420_0000_0000$$$::I turn off the lights in the house.[lr]::
48377::$$$message_0420_0000_0001$$$::It's four in the morning.[lr]::
48378::$$$message_0420_0000_0002$$$::We leave the Emiya residence with a few hours left until dawn.::
48379::$$$message_0420_0001_0000$$$::We have our plan.[lr]::
48380::$$$message_0420_0001_0001$$$::There's nothing else to discuss. Now we just need to go to the battlefield and carry out each of our responsibilities.::
48381::$$$message_0420_0002_0000$$$::...There's no guarantee we'll come back safely.[lr]::
48382::$$$message_0420_0002_0001$$$::Well, until now it's been a recurring event, but this time there is no guarantee we'll return.[lr]::
48383::$$$message_0420_0002_0002$$$::So I need to make sure to turn off all of the lights in my house.::
48384::$$$message_0420_0003_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
48385::$$$message_0420_0003_0001$$$::Someone's standing in the garden.[lr]::
48386::$$$message_0420_0003_0002$$$::A blonde girl gazes up at the night sky, doing nothing in particular.::
48387::$$$message_0420_0004_0000$$$::"Hey! What are you up to, Saber?"[lr]::
48388::$$$message_0420_0004_0001$$$::"I was looking at the sky, and this house."[lr]::
48389::$$$message_0420_0004_0002$$$::She answers me in a very gentle voice.[lr]::
48390::$$$message_0420_0004_0003$$$::When we first met, she looked at this house with a different expression.::
48391::$$$message_0420_0005_0000$$$::"So much has happened. I want to burn it into my memory, so that I always remember."[lr]::
48392::$$$message_0420_0005_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
48393::$$$message_0420_0005_0002$$$::Her voice...[lr]::
48394::$$$message_0420_0005_0003$$$::It reflects a determination that she might never come back, even greater than mine.::
48395::$$$message_0420_0006_0000$$$::"Yeah? ...Well, remember it as long as you can."[lr]::
48396::$$$message_0420_0006_0001$$$::I make a humble request of her from the windowed hallway.::
48397::$$$message_0420_0007_0000$$$::"Yes. I have a favor to ask of you as well.[lr]::
48398::$$$message_0420_0007_0001$$$::I will protect you. So please, make sure you both return to this house."[lr]::
48399::$$$message_0420_0007_0002$$$::"Yeah. We will."::
48400::$$$message_0420_0008_0000$$$::That's the only answer I can give now.[lr]::
48401::$$$message_0420_0008_0001$$$::We're going to destroy the Holy Grail. When that happens, Saber will leave too because she's a Servant.::
48402::$$$message_0420_0009_0000$$$::I'd like her to stay here,[lr]::
48403::$$$message_0420_0009_0001$$$::and she's even developed an attachment to our home.[lr]::
48404::$$$message_0420_0009_0002$$$::But that's a rule she can't break as long as she's a Servant.::
48405::$$$message_0420_0010_0000$$$::"Hey, what are you two doing!? We need to hurry, there isn't much time!"[lr]::
48406::$$$message_0420_0010_0001$$$::A voice beckons us from the front door.[lr]::
48407::$$$message_0420_0010_0002$$$::Tohsaka seems to have finished preparations and is already at the gate.::
48408::$$$message_0420_0011_0000$$$::"Let us be off, Shirou."[lr]::
48409::$$$message_0420_0011_0001$$$::"Yeah. Time to finish this, Saber."[lr]::
48410::$$$message_0420_0011_0002$$$::I turn off the last light, and leave the house with Saber.::
48411::$$$message_0420_0012_0000$$$::    The night is quiet.[lr]::
48412::$$$message_0420_0012_0001$$$::In the garden, under the starry sky, the illusion of a girl gazing up at the stars still remains.::
48413::$$$message_0420_0013_0000$$$::Our direction is set.[lr]::
48414::$$$message_0420_0013_0001$$$::Saber's going to breach Ryudou Temple from the front gate, while Tohsaka and I will infiltrate from the back of the mountain.::
48415::$$$message_0420_0014_0000$$$::We plan to have Saber enter the temple slightly sooner than us to draw Gilgamesh's attention.[lr]::
48416::$$$message_0420_0014_0001$$$::We'll use the opening to sneak into Ryudou Temple from the back, stop the Holy Grail as soon as possible, and then back Saber up.::
48417::$$$message_0420_0015_0000$$$::...Then, I'll counter Gilgamesh's Noble Phantasm with my Projection, so Saber can close in and finish him off.[lr]::
48418::$$$message_0420_0015_0001$$$::That's our only strategy right now.::
48419::$$$message_0420_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
48420::$$$message_0420_0016_0001$$$::There's a barely intact path in the hills behind the temple.[lr]::
48421::$$$message_0420_0016_0002$$$::Tohsaka scales the slope as surely as if she'd scoped out the area beforehand.::
48422::$$$message_0420_0017_0000$$$::At night, the mountains are dark and sinister.[lr]::
48423::$$$message_0420_0017_0001$$$::The mountain is an inviolable and spiritual ground, so it naturally repels us.[lr]::
48424::$$$message_0420_0017_0002$$$::While the dark mountain itself is dangerous to human hikers, it also embodies a sacred realm with high spiritual purity.[lr]::
48425::$$$message_0420_0017_0003$$$::However...::
48426::$$$message_0420_0018_0000$$$::"...This isn't normal. The air's so fishy it's making me nauseous."[lr]::
48427::$$$message_0420_0018_0001$$$::Tohsaka gags, squinting at Ryudou Temple at the summit.[lr]::
48428::$$$message_0420_0018_0002$$$::"Fishy" is just her figure of speech.[lr]::
48429::$$$message_0420_0018_0003$$$::There isn't actually a fishy smell coming from the mountain.[lr]::
48430::$$$message_0420_0018_0004$$$::It just feels bizarre.[lr]::
48431::$$$message_0420_0018_0005$$$::The air feels uncomfortably lukewarm, and it sticks to my skin.::
48432::$$$message_0420_0019_0000$$$::The life energy in the air feels so raw, I can't tell if I'm breathing or the mountain's breathing.[lr]::
48433::$$$message_0420_0019_0001$$$::I even hallucinate that we're hiking up a giant intestine, not a mountain.::
48434::$$$message_0420_0020_0000$$$::"...I should have asked sooner, but how do you feel, Shirou?"[lr]::
48435::$$$message_0420_0020_0001$$$::   Suddenly,[lr]::
48436::$$$message_0420_0020_0002$$$::Tohsaka asked me how I was.::
48437::$$$message_0420_0021_0000$$$::"Huh? Well, not 'good' or 'bad,'[lr]::
48438::$$$message_0420_0021_0001$$$::honestly, I have so much that I don't know what to do with all this."::
48439::$$$message_0420_0022_0000$$$::I tell her my honest feelings.[lr]::
48440::$$$message_0420_0022_0001$$$::With this much magical energy, ten or twenty Projections would be a piece of cake.[lr]::
48441::$$$message_0420_0022_0002$$$::But you could compare it to putting a jet engine on a worn-out plane. I feel like I can't relax, as if I'll spring a fuel leak and explode if I lose focus.::
48442::$$$message_0420_0023_0000$$$::"Wow, that's a nice problem to have. I'm glad it worked out, though. I was worried because it was my first time."[lr]::
48443::$$$message_0420_0023_0001$$$::"Worried? Don't tell me that was actually a really risky ritual?"[lr]::
48444::$$$message_0420_0023_0002$$$::"Not the process, but the aftermath.[lr]::
48445::$$$message_0420_0023_0003$$$::I have to balance the energy I share with you with the energy Saber takes. You know Saber's output is lower because I have to juggle you both, right?"::
48446::$$$message_0420_0024_0000$$$::"Ah... Right, that's true. Then Saber can't fight the way she wants?"::
48447::$$$message_0420_0025_0000$$$::"Hey, don't underestimate me.[lr]::
48448::$$$message_0420_0025_0001$$$::I'm not that sloppy, and I'm not giving you much power compared to Saber, so it'll work itself out.[lr]::
48449::$$$message_0420_0025_0002$$$::Still, we can't be reckless. Saber can only use her sacred sword once right now."::
48450::$$$message_0420_0026_0000$$$::"She can only use it once?"[lr]::
48451::$$$message_0420_0026_0001$$$::...Then she can't use it on Gilgamesh.[lr]::
48452::$$$message_0420_0026_0002$$$::We need Saber's Noble Phantasm to destroy the Holy Grail.::
48453::$$$message_0420_0027_0000$$$::"Then, Saber's going to stop Gilgamesh without her trump card!?"::
48454::$$$message_0420_0028_0000$$$::"Yeah. That's why we need to regroup with her as soon as possible.[lr]::
48455::$$$message_0420_0028_0001$$$::Saber said that she'll use her sacred sword once she determines that she can't stop Gilgamesh.[lr]::
48456::$$$message_0420_0028_0002$$$::...But if she does that, she's finished. She can't destroy the Holy Grail without it.[lr]::
48457::$$$message_0420_0028_0003$$$::So when that happens..."::
48458::$$$message_0420_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
48459::$$$message_0420_0029_0001$$$::He holds his breath.[lr]::
48460::$$$message_0420_0029_0002$$$::When that happens...[lr]::
48461::$$$message_0420_0029_0003$$$::She's prepared to use the sacred sword knowing that she'll disappear afterward.::
48462::$$$message_0420_0030_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, you mean..."[lr]::
48463::$$$message_0420_0030_0001$$$::"...We don't really have a choice. It was Saber's idea. She'll destroy the Holy Grail even if I try to stop her."[lr]::
48464::$$$message_0420_0030_0002$$$::Tohsaka doesn't look at me as she murmurs.::
48465::$$$message_0420_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
48466::$$$message_0420_0031_0001$$$::...Damn it. What a fool she is.[lr]::
48467::$$$message_0420_0031_0002$$$::This is just as hard on Tohsaka.[lr]::
48468::$$$message_0420_0031_0003$$$::She doesn't want Saber to disappear, either.[lr]::
48469::$$$message_0420_0031_0004$$$::Then...::
48470::$$$message_0420_0032_0000$$$::"Let's hurry. I won't let Gilgamesh have Saber."[lr]::
48471::$$$message_0420_0032_0001$$$::"Of course not. Saber belongs to me. I won't let a guy like that kill her."::
48472::$$$message_0420_0033_0000$$$::We run up a game trail.[lr]::
48473::$$$message_0420_0033_0001$$$::I know what we need to do.[lr]::
48474::$$$message_0420_0033_0002$$$::We'll stop the Holy Grail as fast as we can, and then go settle things with Gilgamesh...::&ö
