7202::$$$message_0069_0000_0000$$$::   I run up the stairs.[lr]::
7203::$$$message_0069_0000_0001$$$::Rider and Shinji are on the third floor.[lr]::
7204::$$$message_0069_0000_0002$$$::I can tell Shinji's still on the third floor because of the way my Command Spells are reacting.::
7205::$$$message_0069_0001_0000$$$::The moment I set foot on the third floor, sparks fly.[lr]::
7206::$$$message_0069_0001_0001$$$::"Is that Rider!?"[lr]::
7207::$$$message_0069_0001_0002$$$::I couldn't see, but Saber must have parried Rider's attempt at a sneak attack from above.::
7208::$$$message_0069_0001_0003$$$::"Shirou. I will defeat Rider.[lr]::
7209::$$$message_0069_0001_0004$$$::Please take care of Rider's Master...!"::
7210::$$$message_0069_0002_0000$$$::She doesn't need to tell me.[lr]::
7211::$$$message_0069_0002_0001$$$::Saber can't possibly lose to Rider. She [font italic=true]won't[font italic=false].[lr]::
7212::$$$message_0069_0002_0002$$$::I'm absolutely sure after what little I was able to learn of Rider's abilities during my brief fight with her.[lr]::
7213::$$$message_0069_0002_0003$$$::Saber's abilities vastly exceed Rider's.::
7214::$$$message_0069_0003_0000$$$::"I'm leaving her up to you! But try not to go too far. It'll be over soon once I stop Shinji!"[lr]::
7215::$$$message_0069_0003_0001$$$::I run right past Saber.[lr]::
7216::$$$message_0069_0003_0002$$$::That same instant, Rider flings a dagger at me with murderous intent, but Saber rushes in to deflect the attack!::
7217::$$$message_0069_0004_0000$$$::I run down the hallway.[lr]::
7218::$$$message_0069_0004_0001$$$::Ahead, I see a bewildered Shinji.[lr]::
7219::$$$message_0069_0004_0002$$$::"Guess I'll be at a disadvantage if go at him empty-handed!"[lr]::
7220::$$$message_0069_0004_0003$$$::I need a weapon. It should be long...like the mop leaning against the locker there!::
7221::$$$message_0069_0005_0000$$$::"Trace...on."[lr]::
7222::$$$message_0069_0005_0001$$$::I pass magical energy through my body as I run.[lr]::
7223::$$$message_0069_0005_0002$$$::Maybe I'm not distracted, or maybe I just can't afford to think of anything else...[lr]::
7224::$$$message_0069_0005_0003$$$::I manage to Strengthen the plastic mop as effortlessly as breathing.::
7225::$$$message_0069_0006_0000$$$::The shadows begin forming again.[lr]::
7226::$$$message_0069_0006_0001$$$::I'm badly injured, but I don't feel the least bit sluggish.::
7227::$$$message_0069_0007_0000$$$::More than that, I have a weapon now.[lr]::
7228::$$$message_0069_0007_0001$$$::That means...::
7229::$$$message_0069_0008_0000$$$::...I don't even need to dodge.[lr]::
7230::$$$message_0069_0008_0001$$$::I use the mop to smack aside each shadow as it flies toward me.[lr]::
7231::$$$message_0069_0008_0002$$$::The mop breaks, but I expected as much from something done so hastily.[lr]::
7232::$$$message_0069_0008_0003$$$::Besides, I don't need it anymore. I'm so close!::
7233::$$$message_0069_0009_0000$$$::"SHINJI!!!"[lr]::
7234::$$$message_0069_0009_0001$$$::"Aaack!!!"::
7235::$$$message_0069_0010_0000$$$::I lash out with a furious punch.[lr]::
7236::$$$message_0069_0010_0001$$$::The impact jars my arm, which is still practically cut to ribbons, so painfully that I nearly pass out.::
7237::$$$message_0069_0011_0000$$$::I punch Shinji in the stomach, and then grab him and shove him against the wall.[lr]::
7238::$$$message_0069_0011_0001$$$::"Kngh...you...!"[lr]::
7239::$$$message_0069_0011_0002$$$::Shinji tries to shove my hand away.[lr]::
7240::$$$message_0069_0011_0003$$$::Without missing a beat, I kick his grasping arm.[lr]::
7241::$$$message_0069_0011_0004$$$::   I can't even control myself right now.[lr]::
7242::$$$message_0069_0011_0005$$$::I slam the arm I kicked against the wall...and break it.::
7243::$$$message_0069_0012_0000$$$::"Ah...ggh...AAAHHHH!!!"[lr]::
7244::$$$message_0069_0012_0001$$$::I don't even hear Shinji's screams.::
7245::$$$message_0069_0013_0000$$$::"Ngh...! Hngh!"[lr]::
7246::$$$message_0069_0013_0001$$$::This is bad.[lr]::
7247::$$$message_0069_0013_0002$$$::If I don't focus, it might be me who faints.[lr]::
7248::$$$message_0069_0013_0003$$$::I should hurry while I can still move.::
7249::$$$message_0069_0014_0000$$$::"Ahh!"[lr]::
7250::$$$message_0069_0014_0001$$$::I grab Shinji's hair and smash him against the wall.::
7251::$$$message_0069_0015_0000$$$::"Scream later. Release the Bounded Field, Shinji."[lr]::
7252::$$$message_0069_0015_0001$$$::"Th-the hell I will...who're you to tell me..."[lr]::
7253::$$$message_0069_0015_0002$$$::I grab Shinji by the throat with the arm I can still control.[lr]::
7254::$$$message_0069_0015_0003$$$::Blood pours from my arm.[lr]::
7255::$$$message_0069_0015_0004$$$::It seeps through my clothes and it drips onto Shinji's body, staining him.::
7256::$$$message_0069_0016_0000$$$::"If you won't shut off the Bounded Field, then I just have to kill you. I don't care which it is, so pick one. [font italic=true]Now[font italic=false]."[lr]::
7257::$$$message_0069_0016_0001$$$::I squeeze.[lr]::
7258::$$$message_0069_0016_0002$$$::   It must be all the magical energy coursing through my body...[lr]::
7259::$$$message_0069_0016_0003$$$::I could snap his neck like a twig.::
7260::$$$message_0069_0017_0000$$$::"Ha. You're bluffing. You couldn't do something like that. B-besides, I haven't killed anyone yet. I was just borrowing a little bit of life from everyone..."[lr]::
7261::$$$message_0069_0017_0001$$$::"Okay then. Bye, Shinji."::
7262::$$$message_0069_0018_0000$$$::I squeeze harder.[lr]::
7263::$$$message_0069_0018_0001$$$::There's no hesitation.[lr]::
7264::$$$message_0069_0018_0002$$$::Maybe a little sympathy.[lr]::
7265::$$$message_0069_0018_0003$$$::I feel bad that as a fellow mage, Shinji was never taught the rules of being a mage...and so didn't have any problem killing innocents.::
7266::$$$message_0069_0019_0000$$$::"W-wait! Hold up! You beat me, Emiya! I'll stop the Bounded Field...I promise!"[lr]::
7267::$$$message_0069_0019_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
7268::$$$message_0069_0019_0002$$$::I loosen my grip around his throat.::
7269::$$$message_0069_0020_0000$$$::"...Hah...hah...haaa...damn! You're crazy strong. Hey Rider! Stop your Blood Fort![lr]::
7270::$$$message_0069_0020_0001$$$::Your Master's life's in danger!"::
7271::$$$message_0069_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
7272::$$$message_0069_0021_0001$$$::There's no response from Rider.[lr]::
7273::$$$message_0069_0021_0002$$$::But hearing Shinji, Saber takes a step back from Rider.[lr]::
7274::$$$message_0069_0021_0003$$$::Rider lowers her dagger. I see her mouth move.::
7275::$$$message_0069_0022_0000$$$::"This is what you want, right? I hear this Bounded Field is special, since it's hard to reconstruct another one in the same place. [lr]::
7276::$$$message_0069_0022_0001$$$::So there won't be another Bounded Field here again. Now take your damn hands off of me."::
7277::$$$message_0069_0023_0000$$$::"That's not how this works. [font italic=true]I[font italic=false] won, so you do what [font italic=true]I[font italic=false] say. Shinji, get rid of your Command Spells. Then we'll never have to fight again."::
7278::$$$message_0069_0024_0000$$$::"Wha... That's ridiculous! I'm not doing that! If I get rid of my Command Spells, I won't be able to control Rider. If that happens, I[line2]"::
7279::$$$message_0069_0025_0000$$$::"You won't be a Master anymore. Then you go to the church in Shinto. I hear they protect Masters who drop out of the war.[lr]::
7280::$$$message_0069_0025_0001$$$::Or is it something else? Were you lying when you said you made a Bounded Field to protect yourself?"::
7281::$$$message_0069_0026_0000$$$::"I-I didn't say that. I just thought if I became a Master and controlled a Servant..."[lr]::
7282::$$$message_0069_0026_0001$$$::...He thought he could be a mage.[lr]::
7283::$$$message_0069_0026_0002$$$::But what's the point of becoming one?::
7284::$$$message_0069_0027_0000$$$::"It's over, Shinji. If you're not going to get rid of your Command Spells, I'll just have to cut them out."[lr]::
7285::$$$message_0069_0027_0001$$$::"Eh? Cut them...out?"::
7286::$$$message_0069_0028_0000$$$::Shinji tilts his head in genuine wonderment.[lr]::
7287::$$$message_0069_0028_0001$$$::This isn't an act. Shinji really doesn't know what I'm talking about.::
7288::$$$message_0069_0029_0000$$$::"Well, you see..."[lr]::
7289::$$$message_0069_0029_0001$$$::"Shirou, get back!!!"[lr]::
7290::$$$message_0069_0029_0002$$$::I hear Saber's shout.[lr]::
7291::$$$message_0069_0029_0003$$$::Maybe it's all the training at the dojo...but my body reacts to Saber's words before my brain processes them.::
7292::$$$message_0069_0030_0000$$$::I let go of Shinji and jump back.[lr]::
7293::$$$message_0069_0030_0001$$$::At the moment, Rider's dagger swings through the spot I'd been standing in a heartbeat before.::
7294::$$$message_0069_0031_0000$$$::"R-Rider!?"[lr]::
7295::$$$message_0069_0031_0001$$$::"Step back, Master. We are retreating."::
7296::$$$message_0069_0032_0000$$$::"Shirou, please step back! Rider intends to unleash all the magical energy she used to maintain the Bounded Field!"::
7297::$$$message_0069_0033_0000$$$::"What!? Unleash the magical energy!?"[lr]::
7298::$$$message_0069_0033_0001$$$::I look towards Rider. She does seem odd.[lr]::
7299::$$$message_0069_0033_0002$$$::The way she just appeared here when she'd been confronting Saber a second ago, the cold air emanating from her... Everything about her is suddenly far more intimidating than she has ever been.::
7300::$$$message_0069_0034_0000$$$::"R-Rider!? What the hell are you thinking? You can't even beat Emiya's Servant, so why are you taking the reins!?"::
7301::$$$message_0069_0035_0000$$$::"Correct. I am no match for Saber.[lr]::
7302::$$$message_0069_0035_0001$$$::However, please be assured: my Noble Phantasm is greater than any of the other Servants'. No matter the opponent, they cannot match my agility."::
7303::$$$message_0069_0036_0000$$$::Rider raises her dagger.[lr]::
7304::$$$message_0069_0036_0001$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
7305::$$$message_0069_0036_0002$$$::Everyone gasps in surprise.[lr]::
7306::$$$message_0069_0036_0003$$$::For some reason, Rider presses her dagger to her neck and...[lr]::
7307::$$$message_0069_0036_0004$$$::...slashes her own throat.::
7308::$$$message_0069_0037_0000$$$::Red sprays everywhere.[lr]::
7309::$$$message_0069_0037_0001$$$::Blood gushes from the black-clad Rider's pale neck.::
7310::$$$message_0069_0038_0000$$$::"Wha...what are you...?"[lr]::
7311::$$$message_0069_0038_0001$$$::Shinji is just as surprised as the rest of us.[lr]::
7312::$$$message_0069_0038_0002$$$::No matter how extraordinary Servants may be, a slashed throat is fatal.[lr]::
7313::$$$message_0069_0038_0003$$$::Rider will bleed out and disappear on her own.::
7314::$$$message_0069_0039_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
7315::$$$message_0069_0039_0001$$$::The splattered blood stops mid-air and slowly forms into a circle.::
7316::$$$message_0069_0040_0000$$$::...a magic circle, drawn in blood.[lr]::
7317::$$$message_0069_0040_0001$$$::It's a pattern I've never seen before.[lr]::
7318::$$$message_0069_0040_0002$$$::The design resembles a creature...an ominous creature.[lr]::
7319::$$$message_0069_0040_0003$$$::Rider's created a giant lump of magical energy.[lr]::
7320::$$$message_0069_0040_0004$$$::The Bounded Field from earlier seems like child's play compared to this magic circle.::
7321::$$$message_0069_0041_0000$$$::"Wha...!? I'm being pushed back...!"[lr]::
7322::$$$message_0069_0041_0001$$$::This must be a truly massive amount of magical energy.[lr]::
7323::$$$message_0069_0041_0002$$$::I'm being pushed back as if by a strong wind.::
7324::$$$message_0069_0042_0000$$$::"Shirou, get away! Rider intends to use her Noble Phantasm. If you don't move, you'll be caught in it!"[lr]::
7325::$$$message_0069_0042_0001$$$::Saber grabs me and jerks me back.[lr]::
7326::$$$message_0069_0042_0002$$$::She faces down Rider and her magic circle as she protects me.::
7327::$$$message_0069_0043_0000$$$::"Do you intend to run, Rider?[lr]::
7328::$$$message_0069_0043_0001$$$::If you are going to drag your Master into this, I need only defeat you here. I will not allow you to use your Noble Phantasm."::
7329::$$$message_0069_0044_0000$$$::"Fufu. Of course not. A Servant's duty is to protect her Master. I am just taking Master and running.[lr]::
7330::$$$message_0069_0044_0001$$$::If you do not like that, come after us, Saber."::
7331::$$$message_0069_0045_0000$$$::"If, that is, you still have the will to fight after seeing this."::
7332::$$$message_0069_0046_0000$$$::A throbbing sound pulses through the school.[lr]::
7333::$$$message_0069_0046_0001$$$::With the sound of rending flesh, Rider's hair whirls around her.::
7334::$$$message_0069_0047_0000$$$::"...Hngh!"[lr]::
7335::$$$message_0069_0047_0001$$$::"Shirou, get down!"::
7336::$$$message_0069_0048_0000$$$::Saber tugs my hand and drags me to the ground.[lr]::
7337::$$$message_0069_0048_0001$$$::There's a roar and then a flash.[lr]::
7338::$$$message_0069_0048_0002$$$::I close my eyes against the raging wind.[lr]::
7339::$$$message_0069_0048_0003$$$::But even with my eyes closed, I still feel its intensity. [lr]::
7340::$$$message_0069_0048_0004$$$::Something white streaks by.[lr]::
7341::$$$message_0069_0048_0005$$$::A huge bolt of light shoots down the hallway at tremendous speed.::
7342::$$$message_0069_0049_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
7343::$$$message_0069_0049_0001$$$::All I see before me is dreadful destruction.[lr]::
7344::$$$message_0069_0049_0002$$$::Shinji and Rider are gone.[lr]::
7345::$$$message_0069_0049_0003$$$::The bolt of light wasn't after us. It was probably a means of escape.::
7346::$$$message_0069_0049_0004$$$::"...Ng."[lr]::
7347::$$$message_0069_0049_0005$$$::My wounds hurt.[lr]::
7348::$$$message_0069_0049_0006$$$::I feel a hammering in my head again.[lr]::
7349::$$$message_0069_0049_0007$$$::The heat flowing through my body quickly fades.::
7350::$$$message_0069_0050_0000$$$::"Shirou...?"[lr]::
7351::$$$message_0069_0050_0001$$$::I don't hear Saber's question.[lr]::
7352::$$$message_0069_0050_0002$$$::My vision goes blank white.צנ–
