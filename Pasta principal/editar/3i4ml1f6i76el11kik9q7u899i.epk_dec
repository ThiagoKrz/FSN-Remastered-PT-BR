58707::$$$message_0526_0000_0000$$$::    Light pours in.[lr]::
58708::$$$message_0526_0000_0001$$$::Through my closed eyes, it announces the coming of morning.::
58709::$$$message_0526_0001_0000$$$::I roll over in bed, turning away from the light.[lr]::
58710::$$$message_0526_0001_0001$$$::"Mm..."[lr]::
58711::$$$message_0526_0001_0002$$$::I'm still sleepy.[lr]::
58712::$$$message_0526_0001_0003$$$::Judging by how cold it feels outside, it must be around 5:30 AM.::
58713::$$$message_0526_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58714::$$$message_0526_0002_0001$$$::I went to bed late last night.[lr]::
58715::$$$message_0526_0002_0002$$$::By the time Saber and I returned from the church and I sent her off to sleep in her guest bedroom, it was already after 3:00 AM.[lr]::
58716::$$$message_0526_0002_0003$$$::...I don't think two hours of sleep is enough.[lr]::
58717::$$$message_0526_0002_0004$$$::Not to mention, I ran myself ragged yesterday.[lr]::
58718::$$$message_0526_0002_0005$$$::If I can at least get another thirty minutes of sleep, then[line2]::
58719::$$$message_0526_0003_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
58720::$$$message_0526_0003_0001$$$::In my sleepy haze, I think I just saw something.[lr]::
58721::$$$message_0526_0003_0002$$$::It's right next to my futon.[lr]::
58722::$$$message_0526_0003_0003$$$::Next to me, in other words. Something's kneeling there, incredibly out of place.::
58723::$$$message_0526_0004_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
58724::$$$message_0526_0004_0001$$$::Somehow, it reminds me of a person.[lr]::
58725::$$$message_0526_0004_0002$$$::It's staring so intensely it makes me nervous, um, which means it's...::
58726::$$$message_0526_0005_0000$$$::"SABER!?"[lr]::
58727::$$$message_0526_0005_0001$$$::"Yes. What is it, Shirou?"[lr]::
58728::$$$message_0526_0005_0002$$$::"W-what are you doing in my room!? I even gave you a guest room to sleep in last night!"::
58729::$$$message_0526_0006_0000$$$::I jolt up and start to get out of the futon, but I stop before my lower half leaves the covers.[lr]::
58730::$$$message_0526_0006_0001$$$::Guys, uh, have to deal with...stuff in the morning.::
58731::$$$message_0526_0007_0000$$$::"I object. You did show me to another room, but it's too far away. It would be more appropriate for me to remain nearby, to protect you."::
58732::$$$message_0526_0008_0000$$$::"N-now hold on, just get away from me![lr]::
58733::$$$message_0526_0008_0001$$$::I need you to back up, all right!? Please, damn it, Saber, if you won't, then I will!"::
58734::$$$message_0526_0009_0000$$$::I start rolling away from her, still wrapped up in my sheets like a spring roll.[lr]::
58735::$$$message_0526_0009_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
58736::$$$message_0526_0009_0002$$$::Saber watches me curiously.::
58737::$$$message_0526_0010_0000$$$::   Darn it, doesn't she know I'm a healthy young teenager?[lr]::
58738::$$$message_0526_0010_0001$$$::I get nervous enough when she's close to me, but having her kneel next to me first thing in the morning is certain doom for my brain cells. It's an ambush guaranteed to wipe out the brave soldiers of my frontal lobe!::
58739::$$$message_0526_0011_0000$$$::"Shirou, may I continue?"[lr]::
58740::$$$message_0526_0011_0001$$$::"Ugh... You want to stay in my room?"::
58741::$$$message_0526_0012_0000$$$::"Yes. We should rest in the same room so that I can be ready to defend you at any moment.[lr]::
58742::$$$message_0526_0012_0001$$$::This home has an excellent Bounded Field, but it functions only as an intruder alarm. It will not protect you during an attack."[lr]::
58743::$$$message_0526_0012_0002$$$::"..."::
58744::$$$message_0526_0013_0000$$$::Saber's correct, of course, but I wish she'd consider my mental fortitude.[lr]::
58745::$$$message_0526_0013_0001$$$::If she sleeps in the same room as me, then I might lose my sanity before I lose my life to an enemy.[lr]::
58746::$$$message_0526_0013_0002$$$::Besides, I can't stay with Saber 24/7, so maybe we should draw some boundaries[line2]::
58747::$$$message_0526_0014_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
58748::$$$message_0526_0014_0001$$$::Oh, I forgot.[lr]::
58749::$$$message_0526_0014_0002$$$::I have to go to school today!::
58750::$$$message_0526_0015_0000$$$::"What is wrong, Shirou? You suddenly look pale. I've learned that whenever you make a face like that, you are about to suggest something inadvisable."::
58751::$$$message_0526_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58752::$$$message_0526_0016_0001$$$::She's sharp.[lr]::
58753::$$$message_0526_0016_0002$$$::Saber eyes me suspiciously, loyalty oath nowhere to be seen.::
58754::$$$message_0526_0017_0000$$$::"Well, um. There's something I forgot to tell you."[lr]::
58755::$$$message_0526_0017_0001$$$::I take a seat opposite her.[lr]::
58756::$$$message_0526_0017_0002$$$::Now...[lr]::
58757::$$$message_0526_0017_0003$$$::How can I convince her to let me go to school by myself?:‘ˆÜ
