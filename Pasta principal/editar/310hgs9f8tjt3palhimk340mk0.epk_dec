73561::$$$message_0675_0000_0001$$$::Shinji's corpse is on the bed.[lr]::
73562::$$$message_0675_0000_0002$$$::That's all.[lr]::
73563::$$$message_0675_0000_0003$$$::What happened here?[lr]::
73564::$$$message_0675_0000_0004$$$::It shouldn't be possible to glean what happened, but...[lr]::
73565::$$$message_0675_0000_0005$$$::"...Sakura."[lr]::
73566::$$$message_0675_0000_0006$$$::I know she killed him.::
73567::$$$message_0675_0001_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
73568::$$$message_0675_0001_0001$$$::I can't think straight.[lr]::
73569::$$$message_0675_0001_0002$$$::Shinji's body.[lr]::
73570::$$$message_0675_0001_0003$$$::Sakura's whereabouts.[lr]::
73571::$$$message_0675_0001_0004$$$::It hasn't even been half a day since I held Sakura last night, so how...why...::
73572::$$$message_0675_0002_0000$$$::"Oh, if it isn't the Emiya boy.[lr]::
73573::$$$message_0675_0002_0001$$$::I'd say you did well coming here, but you're a tad late."::
73574::$$$message_0675_0003_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
73575::$$$message_0675_0003_0001$$$::I whirl around at the sudden voice.::
73576::$$$message_0675_0004_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
73577::$$$message_0675_0004_0001$$$::Nobody's behind me.[lr]::
73578::$$$message_0675_0004_0002$$$::I know that there isn't anyone in this mansion.[lr]::
73579::$$$message_0675_0004_0003$$$::This is just Zouken's voice, transmitted from somewhere else.::
73580::$$$message_0675_0005_0000$$$::"Zouken! What did you do to Sakura!?"::
73581::$$$message_0675_0006_0000$$$::"Nothing at all. As you can see, she turned the tables on my incompetent grandson. It's hardly anything to make a fuss about.[lr]::
73582::$$$message_0675_0006_0001$$$::Although... Hm, perhaps I shouldn't call him incompetent anymore.[lr]::
73583::$$$message_0675_0006_0002$$$::He was useless, but he did serve his purpose in the end."::
73584::$$$message_0675_0007_0000$$$::He chuckles.[lr]::
73585::$$$message_0675_0007_0001$$$::I can't see the old mage, but it's clear that he's enjoying this.::
73586::$$$message_0675_0008_0000$$$::"Shinji's purpose...?"[lr]::
73587::$$$message_0675_0008_0001$$$::"Oh, yes. I could not have driven Sakura to such lengths. She despised me a bit too much for that. I needed you or Shinji to break the seal on that dam.[lr]::
73588::$$$message_0675_0008_0002$$$::Sakura could only accept her own shadow once she lost all faith in the world."::
73589::$$$message_0675_0009_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
73590::$$$message_0675_0009_0001$$$::"This was my mistake, I admit. I underestimated her willpower. [lr]::
73591::$$$message_0675_0009_0002$$$::I never expected her to grow into such a patient girl."::
73592::$$$message_0675_0010_0000$$$::"...What..."[lr]::
73593::$$$message_0675_0010_0001$$$::My nerves condense.[lr]::
73594::$$$message_0675_0010_0002$$$::Before I can even comprehend his rambling, my right hand balls into a fist and I instantly open my Magic Circuit[line2]::
73595::$$$message_0675_0011_0000$$$::"I would have most preferred it if the betrayal had come from you, though. Then, she wouldn't have awakened only halfway, and would have fully become the Shadow in both body and mind![lr]::
73596::$$$message_0675_0011_0001$$$::Still, it is only a matter of time.[lr]::
73597::$$$message_0675_0011_0002$$$::With Shinji's death, she has finally accepted her position. All I need to do now is watch. She will follow her instincts and attack people, and destroy herself with her gluttony.[lr]::
73598::$$$message_0675_0011_0003$$$::My task comes after[line2]"::
73599::$$$message_0675_0012_0000$$$::I punch him.[lr]::
73600::$$$message_0675_0012_0001$$$::I punch the voice in the darkness, where there should only be a wall, with all my might.[lr]::
73601::$$$message_0675_0012_0002$$$::My punch, unconsciously powered by all the magical energy I could ram into it, blasts through the wall, sweeping away the darkness staining the room.::
73602::$$$message_0675_0013_0000$$$::"Oh, how fearsome. You've crushed all the bugs I left there to monitor the room. Haha, soon, my voice won't be able to reach you."[r][wsay canskip=1]::
73603::$$$message_0675_0013_0001$$$::"Shut up and show yourself, Zouken! I'll rip you apart!"::
73604::$$$message_0675_0014_0000$$$::"Unfortunately, I can't do that. I am on the cusp of achieving the Makiris' five-hundred-year old dream.[lr]::
73605::$$$message_0675_0014_0001$$$::I can't afford to let you kill me, nor am I ungrateful enough to kill you."::
73606::$$$message_0675_0015_0000$$$::"Ungrateful...? Bullshit, when have I ever helped you!?"::
73607::$$$message_0675_0016_0000$$$::"But you have. You raised her splendidly. You taught her how it feels to want someone else.[lr]::
73608::$$$message_0675_0016_0001$$$::I thank you, Shirou Emiya. The ritual will finally succeed thanks to you.[lr]::
73609::$$$message_0675_0016_0002$$$::Thus, I will not kill you. I want you to see the fruits of your labor...!"::
73610::$$$message_0675_0017_0000$$$::"Rrgh...Zouken..."[lr]::
73611::$$$message_0675_0017_0001$$$::"Haha, no one can stop her now. Now that she's killed her brother, she cannot stop.[lr]::
73612::$$$message_0675_0017_0002$$$::The Einzbern Grail. Once she absorbs that little girl and the Archer she took, Sakura will unlock the gate.[lr]::
73613::$$$message_0675_0017_0003$$$::Then it will be checkmate. The Makiris will finally achieve our long-cherished dream, and recreate the Third Magic...!"::
73614::$$$message_0675_0018_0000$$$::His laugh is grating.[lr]::
73615::$$$message_0675_0018_0001$$$::I...[lr]:ÒçZ
