10599::$$$message_0108_0000_0000$$$::It's a quiet, windless night.[lr]::
10600::$$$message_0108_0000_0001$$$::It's past midnight.[lr]::
10601::$$$message_0108_0000_0002$$$::Darkness blankets the sky.[lr]::
10602::$$$message_0108_0000_0003$$$::The town itself is like a dark sea, illuminated only by moonlight.::
10603::$$$message_0108_0001_0000$$$::Overhead, the clouds move across the sky.[lr]::
10604::$$$message_0108_0001_0001$$$::At ground level, there's not a breath of wind.[lr]::
10605::$$$message_0108_0001_0002$$$::Higher up, the air must be roaring, as the clouds swim by.[lr]::
10606::$$$message_0108_0001_0003$$$::"There is at least some wind."[lr]::
10607::$$$message_0108_0001_0004$$$::Maybe she hears the inaudible wind.[lr]::
10608::$$$message_0108_0001_0005$$$::She mutters quietly as she looks up into the windy sky.::
10609::$$$message_0108_0002_0000$$$::The young girl known as Saber stands quietly in the middle of the yard, glaring up at the sky.[lr]::
10610::$$$message_0108_0002_0001$$$::Her golden hair is beautiful even in the dark of the night. Her clear green eyes remain on the moon as it flickers in and out of view.[lr]::
10611::$$$message_0108_0002_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
10612::$$$message_0108_0002_0003$$$::She glances toward the corner of the yard once.::
10613::$$$message_0108_0003_0000$$$::There is an old shed; her lord sleeps there.[lr]::
10614::$$$message_0108_0003_0001$$$::"If you say you will not fight, fine."[lr]::
10615::$$$message_0108_0003_0002$$$::There's a heavy clang.[lr]::
10616::$$$message_0108_0003_0003$$$::The sound of iron melts into the darkness without reaching anyone's ears.[lr]::
10617::$$$message_0108_0003_0004$$$::The moon hides, then reveals itself once again.[lr]::
10618::$$$message_0108_0003_0005$$$::As the clouds above float past, the girl's appearance changes radically.::
10619::$$$message_0108_0004_0000$$$::Solid, heavy armor.[lr]::
10620::$$$message_0108_0004_0001$$$::She can no longer be called a girl in her blue raiment.[lr]::
10621::$$$message_0108_0004_0002$$$::Now, she is shrouded in steely armor, woven of magical energy intense enough that it would overwhelm all others.[lr]::
10622::$$$message_0108_0004_0003$$$::In her hand, she holds an invisible sword, concealed by the same magical energy that surpasses human understanding.[lr]::
10623::$$$message_0108_0004_0004$$$::The figure, once considered undefeatable in the battlefield, proves that someone like her still exists in this day and age.::
10624::$$$message_0108_0005_0000$$$::Though her sword is invisible, the majestic air she exudes proves her exceptional skill as a swordsman.[lr]::
10625::$$$message_0108_0005_0001$$$::This is what has made her Saber.[lr]::
10626::$$$message_0108_0005_0002$$$::The hero of the sword, said to be the strongest of all the seven Servants...[lr]::
10627::$$$message_0108_0005_0003$$$::A knight among knights who remains ever civil, and acts according to her lord's will.[lr]::
10628::$$$message_0108_0005_0004$$$::Whatever the other Heroic Spirits may be like, she remains the ideal swordsman who would never defy her lord.::
10629::$$$message_0108_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
10630::$$$message_0108_0006_0001$$$::But that ends tonight.[lr]::
10631::$$$message_0108_0006_0002$$$::She is here, defying her lord's orders.[lr]::
10632::$$$message_0108_0006_0003$$$::Rather, she is not truly disobeying her lord.[lr]::
10633::$$$message_0108_0006_0004$$$::This is her way of bringing her lord victory...the result of her own determination.::
10634::$$$message_0108_0007_0000$$$::"He is too na√Øve. If he continues on this path, it will lead only to death at another Master's hands."[lr]::
10635::$$$message_0108_0007_0001$$$::But this Master will never change his ways.[lr]::
10636::$$$message_0108_0007_0002$$$::Then it must be her duty to be heartless.[lr]::
10637::$$$message_0108_0007_0003$$$::If her Master will not fight, then his sword must.::
10638::$$$message_0108_0008_0000$$$::"My wounds have not healed. I cannot expect a supply of magical energy from Master."[lr]::
10639::$$$message_0108_0008_0001$$$::But that still poses no hindrance in battle.[lr]::
10640::$$$message_0108_0008_0002$$$::After confirming her own abilities, she returns her gaze to the moon.[lr]::
10641::$$$message_0108_0008_0003$$$::She has no concern for the shed where her lord sleeps any longer.[lr]::
10642::$$$message_0108_0008_0004$$$::Now that she is armed and wearing her armor, the only thing on her mind is defeating her enemies.::
10643::$$$message_0108_0009_0000$$$::The moon darkens.[lr]::
10644::$$$message_0108_0009_0001$$$::The moment a large cloud covers the sky, Saber jumps over the walls of the mansion grounds.::
10645::$$$message_0108_0010_0000$$$::She runs through the darkness.[lr]::
10646::$$$message_0108_0010_0001$$$::The silvery swordsman rushes through the sleeping town.::
10647::$$$message_0108_0011_0000$$$::She has but one destination: Ryudou Temple, sitting at the heart of the sacred mountain on the town's outskirts.[lr]::
10648::$$$message_0108_0011_0001$$$::Even Saber understands how difficult it will be to single-handedly defeat the Master lurking in the temple.[lr]::
10649::$$$message_0108_0011_0002$$$::Shirou is correct. She is bound to suffer great injury, or at worst, die herself.::
10650::$$$message_0108_0012_0000$$$::But how can she call herself a Servant if she cannot do the impossible?[lr]::
10651::$$$message_0108_0012_0001$$$::Servants are driven by their superior abilities and unassailable pride.[lr]::
10652::$$$message_0108_0012_0002$$$::They are proud as heroes, and have earned that confidence in the numerous battles they fought.[lr]::
10653::$$$message_0108_0012_0003$$$::As Heroic Spirits whose lore has been passed down and respected since ancient times, they cannot lose, no matter who they face.[lr]::
10654::$$$message_0108_0012_0004$$$::She cannot even imagine defeat.::
10655::$$$message_0108_0013_0000$$$::She is no exception, however much of her innocence may still be left to her.[lr]::
10656::$$$message_0108_0013_0001$$$::Being granted the title of Saber is all the more reason she cannot ignore that pride.[lr]::
10657::$$$message_0108_0013_0002$$$::And that pride will not allow her to just sit by and do nothing when she can face her enemy.::
10658::$$$message_0108_0014_0000$$$::And so she must brave any traps that may await her, and face her enemy even if she is alone.[lr]::
10659::$$$message_0108_0014_0001$$$::If she has no chance of winning, then she must simply use her sword to [font italic=true]create[font italic=false] one.[lr]::
10660::$$$message_0108_0014_0002$$$::Her sword is a celebrated blade. It has cut countless enemies down.[lr]::
10661::$$$message_0108_0014_0003$$$::As long as she has Invisible Air, there is nothing for her to fear.::
10662::$$$message_0108_0015_0000$$$::She runs through the mountain pass and up the road leading to the temple.[lr]::
10663::$$$message_0108_0015_0001$$$::After she cuts through the mountain pass, an imposing stone staircase awaits her.::
10664::$$$message_0108_0016_0000$$$::"Ah, this is certainly..."[lr]::
10665::$$$message_0108_0016_0001$$$::It is certainly different than the Ryudou Temple she remembers.[lr]::
10666::$$$message_0108_0016_0002$$$::The air is stagnant.[lr]::
10667::$$$message_0108_0016_0003$$$::The wind is barren.[lr]::
10668::$$$message_0108_0016_0004$$$::The land's lifeline was contaminated long ago.[lr]::
10669::$$$message_0108_0016_0005$$$::This place is a land of death.[lr]::
10670::$$$message_0108_0016_0006$$$::The moment one enters, there can be no escape.::
10671::$$$message_0108_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
10672::$$$message_0108_0017_0001$$$::She does not hesitate.[lr]::
10673::$$$message_0108_0017_0002$$$::Saber does not so much as break stride as she runs up the steps.::
10674::$$$message_0108_0018_0000$$$::Scenery flies by.[lr]::
10675::$$$message_0108_0018_0001$$$::Her footsteps echo on the stone stairs, and the mountain begins to stir.::
10676::$$$message_0108_0019_0000$$$::The stairs are long, stretching across a great distance[lr]::
10677::$$$message_0108_0019_0001$$$::The temple gates are far even for Saber, who shoots up the stairs like an arrow.[lr]::
10678::$$$message_0108_0019_0002$$$::So long are the stairs that it is impossible for one to pass through the gate undetected.[lr]::
10679::$$$message_0108_0019_0003$$$::An ambush surely awaits along the way.[lr]::
10680::$$$message_0108_0019_0004$$$::Reaching the gate will not be easy.[lr]::
10681::$$$message_0108_0019_0005$$$::Whatever schemes may await her, she must simply smash through them and keep moving.::
10682::$$$message_0108_0020_0000$$$::Nothing will stop her.[lr]::
10683::$$$message_0108_0020_0001$$$::Even were Berserker to appear before her, she would break through.[lr]::
10684::$$$message_0108_0020_0002$$$::Such is her determination, her confidence.::
10685::$$$message_0108_0021_0000$$$::She's reached the top.[lr]::
10686::$$$message_0108_0021_0001$$$::Just as she is about to reach the temple gates, the obstacle presents itself.::
10687::$$$message_0108_0022_0000$$$::"...Ng!"[lr]::
10688::$$$message_0108_0022_0001$$$::Saber stops.[lr]::
10689::$$$message_0108_0022_0002$$$::Despite her determination to push through no matter what enemy she faces, she is surprised by what she finds.[lr]::
10690::$$$message_0108_0022_0003$$$::It appears so naturally, like a breeze.[lr]::
10691::$$$message_0108_0022_0004$$$::The man appears before her, lacking any trace of enmity, but leaves not a single opening for an attack.::
10692::$$$message_0108_0023_0000$$$::"You..."[lr]::
10693::$$$message_0108_0023_0001$$$::Saber stops and readies her invisible sword.[lr]::
10694::$$$message_0108_0023_0002$$$::The man before her, backlit by the moon, ignores Saber's menacing glare as if it were nothing to him.::
10695::$$$message_0108_0024_0000$$$::"A...samurai...?"[lr]::
10696::$$$message_0108_0024_0001$$$::She has heard about them, but she is bewildered by the sight of one.[lr]::
10697::$$$message_0108_0024_0002$$$::This is her second Holy Grail War.[lr]::
10698::$$$message_0108_0024_0003$$$::Even though she has seen many other Heroic Spirits, this is her first time seeing a Servant like him.::
10699::$$$message_0108_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
10700::$$$message_0108_0025_0001$$$::Sweat beads on Saber's brow.[lr]::
10701::$$$message_0108_0025_0002$$$::She isn't afraid. Rather, she is struggling to comprehend the situation.::
10702::$$$message_0108_0026_0000$$$::It is not as if she has never encountered strange Servants.[lr]::
10703::$$$message_0108_0026_0001$$$::Certainly, there was no stranger and more mysterious Servant than the Archer of the previous war.[lr]::
10704::$$$message_0108_0026_0002$$$::By comparison, the Servant before her is hardly frightening, and possesses no incredible weaponry.::
10705::$$$message_0108_0027_0000$$$::And that is exactly what makes it strange.[lr]::
10706::$$$message_0108_0027_0001$$$::She senses nothing from the man.[lr]::
10707::$$$message_0108_0027_0002$$$::There is no doubt he is a Servant, but he seems to possess neither a Noble Phantasm nor magical energy.::
10708::$$$message_0108_0028_0000$$$::He should be an easy foe.[lr]::
10709::$$$message_0108_0028_0001$$$::Their fight should end in a single blow.[lr]::
10710::$$$message_0108_0028_0002$$$::But her instincts give her one very simple warning: [lr]::
10711::$$$message_0108_0028_0003$$$::   Don't underestimate him.[lr]::
10712::$$$message_0108_0028_0004$$$::This Servant has a means of inflicting instant death.::
10713::$$$message_0108_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
10714::$$$message_0108_0029_0001$$$::She can't get closer.[lr]::
10715::$$$message_0108_0029_0002$$$::His katana is unconventionally long for a Japanese sword, making it hard to gauge spacing, but more than that, Saber's position puts her at a huge disadvantage.::
10716::$$$message_0108_0030_0000$$$::The man stands at the top of the stairs, and Saber stands below him.[lr]::
10717::$$$message_0108_0030_0001$$$::He's about five meters from her.[lr]::
10718::$$$message_0108_0030_0002$$$::His sword will reach her before she can rush him.::
10719::$$$message_0108_0031_0000$$$::But she feels nothing from his sword.[lr]::
10720::$$$message_0108_0031_0001$$$::Repelling it should be easy.[lr]::
10721::$$$message_0108_0031_0002$$$::She should not be afraid to step in, but Saber senses somehow that she should not.::
10722::$$$message_0108_0032_0000$$$::Saber adjusts her grip on her sword and glares at the enemy ahead of her.[lr]::
10723::$$$message_0108_0032_0001$$$::She may not know his identity, but she should at least be able to determine his class.[lr]::
10724::$$$message_0108_0032_0002$$$::"...I ask of you. What Servant are you?"[lr]::
10725::$$$message_0108_0032_0003$$$::Saber doesn't expect an answer.::
10726::$$$message_0108_0033_0000$$$::After a brief smile...::
10727::$$$message_0108_0034_0000$$$::                                       "Servant, Assassin. Sasaki Kojirou."::
10728::$$$message_0108_0035_0000$$$::The Servant's reply is given in a singsong voice.::
10729::$$$message_0108_0036_0000$$$::"Wha...!"[lr]::
10730::$$$message_0108_0036_0001$$$::Saber cannot help but be surprised.[lr]::
10731::$$$message_0108_0036_0002$$$::Servants generally conceal their identities.[lr]::
10732::$$$message_0108_0036_0003$$$::What sort of Servant would so bluntly and proudly give his name?::
10733::$$$message_0108_0037_0000$$$::"You...why...?"::
10734::$$$message_0108_0038_0000$$$::"'Why?' What a boorish question. It is only polite to introduce myself before a duel. All the more so against an opponent so beautiful as you. How odd, then, that you should react as you have."[lr]::
10735::$$$message_0108_0038_0001$$$::The man who introduced himself as Sasaki Kojirou, the Assassin, appears to enjoy Saber's confusion.::
10736::$$$message_0108_0039_0000$$$::There is no way Saber knows.[lr]::
10737::$$$message_0108_0039_0001$$$::She has no idea this Servant is a swordsman who wields a long sword called Monohoshizao, and was rumored to have been an unrivaled swordsman during the Keichou era in Japan. [lr]::
10738::$$$message_0108_0039_0002$$$::Knowing, of course, would change nothing.[lr]::
10739::$$$message_0108_0039_0003$$$::The man's origin is unknown, and even his existence is uncertain.[lr]::
10740::$$$message_0108_0039_0004$$$::His story was told only by word of mouth, and there is perhaps only one person in the world who knows the true identity of the man who was hailed as the greatest swordsman in the world: the man who never left a mark in history, but was Sasaki Kojirou's archenemy, and the only one to have ever defeated him.::
10741::$$$message_0108_0040_0000$$$::So how can this man be called a hero?[lr]::
10742::$$$message_0108_0040_0001$$$::The Assassin...Sasaki Kojirou is a presence far removed from Saber herself.[lr]::
10743::$$$message_0108_0040_0002$$$::Who among Heroic Spirits could know the abilities of a swordsman who could not himself normally [font italic=true]be[font italic=false] a Heroic Spirit?::
10744::$$$message_0108_0041_0000$$$::"However..."[lr]::
10745::$$$message_0108_0041_0001$$$::Two things are clear for her.[lr]::
10746::$$$message_0108_0041_0002$$$::One is that the man before her is an enemy, and the other is that he has willingly identified himself.[lr]::
10747::$$$message_0108_0041_0003$$$::"You are certainly correct. A knight's honor demands revealing oneself when addressed, and that one should return the gesture in kind."::
10748::$$$message_0108_0042_0000$$$::Saber's voice is grave. [lr]::
10749::$$$message_0108_0042_0001$$$::Revealing her True Name poses an immense risk.[lr]::
10750::$$$message_0108_0042_0002$$$::She cannot reveal her True Name, even under torture, nor does she have any intention of doing so.[lr]::
10751::$$$message_0108_0042_0003$$$::   However, this is only in the name of her pursuit of victory.[lr]::
10752::$$$message_0108_0042_0004$$$::For this same reason, she cannot tarnish her knight's honor.::
10753::$$$message_0108_0043_0000$$$::"Kojirou, you said?[lr]::
10754::$$$message_0108_0043_0001$$$::Assassin, I am..."[lr]::
10755::$$$message_0108_0043_0002$$$::"Say no more. I know you are the sort who must give your name in kind if I do so first.[lr]::
10756::$$$message_0108_0043_0003$$$::It was I who was boorish."[lr]::
10757::$$$message_0108_0043_0004$$$::The man descends the stairs gracefully.[lr]::
10758::$$$message_0108_0043_0005$$$::Assassin confronts Saber, taking slow steps down the stairs.::
10759::$$$message_0108_0044_0000$$$::"I need not know my enemy in this way. If we are to battle, we shall speak with our blades.[lr]::
10760::$$$message_0108_0044_0001$$$::Am I wrong, Saber?"[lr]::
10761::$$$message_0108_0044_0002$$$::"Wha...!?"::
10762::$$$message_0108_0045_0000$$$::"This should be no surprise. I do not know what you are holding, but the murderous intent surrounding you most certainly belongs to a swordsman.[lr]::
10763::$$$message_0108_0045_0001$$$::Hm. That beautiful, dazzling aura of a swordsman...you can only be Saber."[lr]::
10764::$$$message_0108_0045_0002$$$::He takes a step closer.[lr]::
10765::$$$message_0108_0045_0003$$$::Assassin descends the stone steps, and he points his sword at Saber.::
10766::$$$message_0108_0046_0000$$$::"I do not care to know your True Name. All that matters to me is that the Servant known as Saber falls by my blade.[lr]::
10767::$$$message_0108_0046_0001$$$::There is nothing to discuss. Is that not what it is to be a Servant in any case?"[lr]::
10768::$$$message_0108_0046_0002$$$::The swordsman laughs joyfully.::
10769::$$$message_0108_0047_0000$$$::"I see. Yes, that is true."[lr]::
10770::$$$message_0108_0047_0001$$$::As Saber speaks, she readies her sword.::
10771::$$$message_0108_0048_0000$$$::"That's the spirit.[lr]::
10772::$$$message_0108_0048_0001$$$::Then let us duel, Saber.[lr]::
10773::$$$message_0108_0048_0002$$$::I must see your swordsmanship, said to be the greatest of all Servants."::
10774::$$$message_0108_0049_0000$$$::[se volume=50 storage=se111]A silver light leaps.[se volume=50 storage=se112][lr]::
10775::$$$message_0108_0049_0001$$$::Solid and soft.[lr]::
10776::$$$message_0108_0049_0002$$$::The battle between two very different swordsmen begins under the moonlight.::†
