59517::$$$message_0540_0000_0000$$$::...It's morning.[lr]::
59518::$$$message_0540_0000_0001$$$::It's after seven o'clock.[lr]::
59519::$$$message_0540_0000_0002$$$::The weather is nice outside, and bright white sunlight pours in.::
59520::$$$message_0540_0001_0000$$$::"Mm...hup."[lr]::
59521::$$$message_0540_0001_0001$$$::I get up and stretch my back.[lr]::
59522::$$$message_0540_0001_0002$$$::Physically, I feel well.[lr]::
59523::$$$message_0540_0001_0003$$$::I can move my limbs easily, and there's no trace of any headache.[lr]::
59524::$$$message_0540_0001_0004$$$::I feel great waking up today, as if the horror of last night never happened.::
59525::$$$message_0540_0002_0000$$$::"...Must have just been heartburn."[lr]::
59526::$$$message_0540_0002_0001$$$::I sigh and think back on what happened.[lr]::
59527::$$$message_0540_0002_0002$$$::...Even if I was reliving what happened ten years ago, I really need to train more if I can't remember anything that happened.[lr]::
59528::$$$message_0540_0002_0003$$$::My memories since collapsing in the park are vague. All I remember is leaning on Saber's shoulder and being put to bed.::
59529::$$$message_0540_0003_0000$$$::"Oh, right. I need to thank Saber."[lr]::
59530::$$$message_0540_0003_0001$$$::I get out of bed and quickly change into my school uniform.::
59531::$$$message_0540_0004_0000$$$::Saber seems like she's still asleep, so I'll go have breakfast.[lr]::
59532::$$$message_0540_0004_0001$$$::It's already seven, so I should go see if Sakura's in the living room.::
59533::$$$message_0540_0005_0000$$$::"S-Senpai."[lr]::
59534::$$$message_0540_0005_0001$$$::In the living room, I find Sakura holding her school bag.[lr]::
59535::$$$message_0540_0005_0002$$$::Breakfast is ready.[lr]::
59536::$$$message_0540_0005_0003$$$::The table is neatly arranged and ready for us to start dining right away.::
59537::$$$message_0540_0006_0000$$$::"Oh, is breakfast ready already?"[lr]::
59538::$$$message_0540_0006_0001$$$::"Ah, yes. I had time, so I made enough for you and Saber, too."::
59539::$$$message_0540_0007_0000$$$::"? But what about your food?"[lr]::
59540::$$$message_0540_0007_0001$$$::"Um... I'll be okay. I'm going to school first, so please enjoy your breakfast."::
59541::$$$message_0540_0008_0000$$$::"...?[lr]::
59542::$$$message_0540_0008_0001$$$::What's wrong, Sakura? It's weird that you made us breakfast, yet you aren't going to have any... Did something happen yesterday?"::
59543::$$$message_0540_0009_0000$$$::...Sounds like I was on the mark.[lr]::
59544::$$$message_0540_0009_0001$$$::But I can't think of anything from yesterday's events that would apply.[lr]::
59545::$$$message_0540_0009_0002$$$::After dinner last night, Sakura went back to her room, and that was the last time I saw her.[lr]::
59546::$$$message_0540_0009_0003$$$::After that...I think something happened, but the thought gives me so much nausea that I can't remember.::
59547::$$$message_0540_0010_0000$$$::"Oh, come to think of it, I remember talking with you and Saber about something."::
59548::$$$message_0540_0011_0000$$$::"...I said something terrible. When I saw you nearly unconscious, I lost my temper."[lr]::
59549::$$$message_0540_0011_0001$$$::"You said something to Saber?"::
59550::$$$message_0540_0012_0000$$$::"...Yes. Something that I had no right to say. It pinned all the blame on Saber.[lr]::
59551::$$$message_0540_0012_0001$$$::...So, I can't really look her in the eye right now."[lr]::
59552::$$$message_0540_0012_0002$$$::So that's why she made breakfast for two and is trying to leave before she runs into Saber.::
59553::$$$message_0540_0013_0000$$$::"...I'm sorry. I realized how stupid I was being and apologized to her right away. And then Saber apologized to me, too. She said she was careless, even though it was all my fault."::
59554::$$$message_0540_0014_0000$$$::Sakura hangs her head, looking ashamed.[lr]::
59555::$$$message_0540_0014_0001$$$::...I see.[lr]::
59556::$$$message_0540_0014_0002$$$::If you apologize to someone and they end up apologizing back to you, that would make you feel even worse.::
59557::$$$message_0540_0015_0000$$$::"...You two are so silly. I'm obviously the one most responsible for getting myself hurt. You shouldn't argue over something like that."[lr]::
59558::$$$message_0540_0015_0001$$$::"But Senpai, Saber didn't[line2]"::
59559::$$$message_0540_0016_0000$$$::"It's okay. I'll just say this now, but when she knows someone else is wrong, she doesn't back down. If you make a bad case to her, she'll get really mad at you. The fact that she apologized means that she accepts what you said.[lr]::
59560::$$$message_0540_0016_0001$$$::Saber might not say it, but she likes you. She values people who try their best."::
59561::$$$message_0540_0017_0000$$$::"...Yes. That's all the more reason I'm avoiding her this morning.[lr]::
59562::$$$message_0540_0017_0001$$$::Since Saber didn't scold me, I need to be harder on myself or else it'll get to my head."[lr]::
59563::$$$message_0540_0017_0002$$$::Sakura laughs bashfully and gives me a modest bow.[lr]::
59564::$$$message_0540_0017_0003$$$::Looks like her mind is set on leaving for school early.::
59565::$$$message_0540_0018_0000$$$::"...If you insist, then I won't stop you. But what are you going to do so early in the morning? Practice is cancelled."::
59566::$$$message_0540_0019_0000$$$::"It's okay, I can just clean the dojo. After what I said to Saber, it's only right that I scrub the floors as penance."[lr]::
59567::$$$message_0540_0019_0001$$$::Sakura bids me farewell and leaves the living room.::
59568::$$$message_0540_0020_0000$$$::"Cleaning the dojo? It's really hard to scrub the floors in the winter, you know."[lr]::
59569::$$$message_0540_0020_0001$$$::...She knows that as well as I do, though, which is probably why she said it.[lr]::
59570::$$$message_0540_0020_0002$$$::I wonder what she said to pick a fight with Saber, if she thinks she has to do such an unenviable task to make up for it.::ïº
