60257::$$$message_0548_0000_0000$$$::"Urgh."[lr]::
60258::$$$message_0548_0000_0001$$$::The pain where Assassin punched me in the stomach brings me back to my senses.[lr]::
60259::$$$message_0548_0000_0002$$$::...Rider and I are the only ones left in the shrine room.[lr]::
60260::$$$message_0548_0000_0003$$$::I take a deep breath to calm myself down.[lr]::
60261::$$$message_0548_0000_0004$$$::   After a moment,[lr]::
60262::$$$message_0548_0000_0005$$$::I realize that only my stomach and back are hurting.::
60263::$$$message_0548_0001_0000$$$::"Sa..."[lr]::
60264::$$$message_0548_0001_0001$$$::I know what that means now, even without thinking about it.::
60265::$$$message_0548_0002_0000$$$::"...ber..."[lr]::
60266::$$$message_0548_0002_0001$$$::I push through my dizziness and head for the corridor.::
60267::$$$message_0548_0003_0000$$$::"Wait. It's dangerous to go alone."[lr]::
60268::$$$message_0548_0003_0001$$$::"You..."[lr]::
60269::$$$message_0548_0003_0002$$$::Rider doesn't seem to mean me any harm.[lr]::
60270::$$$message_0548_0003_0003$$$::She was really here to save me.::
60271::$$$message_0548_0004_0000$$$::"Why did you..."[lr]::
60272::$$$message_0548_0004_0001$$$::Save me, I almost finish, but I almost don't care at this point.[lr]::
60273::$$$message_0548_0004_0002$$$::Right now, I want to...::
60274::$$$message_0548_0005_0000$$$::"You're Shinji's Servant. Why would you help me?"[lr]::
60275::$$$message_0548_0005_0001$$$::   I want to go to her.[lr]::
60276::$$$message_0548_0005_0002$$$::Why am I taking this detour?::
60277::$$$message_0548_0006_0000$$$::"I was commanded not to let you die. I simply followed my Master's orders."::
60278::$$$message_0548_0007_0000$$$::...I see.[lr]::
60279::$$$message_0548_0007_0001$$$::Whatever. I don't believe it, but if that's her answer, then fine.[lr]::
60280::$$$message_0548_0007_0002$$$::Never mind that. I need...to hurry...::
60281::$$$message_0548_0008_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
60282::$$$message_0548_0008_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60283::$$$message_0548_0008_0002$$$::I know with one glance what I'm going to find.::
60284::$$$message_0548_0009_0000$$$::The corridor is silent.[lr]::
60285::$$$message_0548_0009_0001$$$::It's half-destroyed, torn apart as if a tornado went through.[lr]::
60286::$$$message_0548_0009_0002$$$::On the only intact portion of the floor, I find a red stain.::
60287::$$$message_0548_0010_0000$$$::It's smaller than the palm of my hand, and I don't know who the blood belongs to.[lr]::
60288::$$$message_0548_0010_0001$$$::But as soon as I see it, I feel my legs go weak, and I drop to my knees.::
60289::$$$message_0548_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60290::$$$message_0548_0011_0001$$$::I touch the red stain.[lr]::
60291::$$$message_0548_0011_0002$$$::The blood is dry, and it doesn't stick to my fingers.[lr]::
60292::$$$message_0548_0011_0003$$$::It seems to declare that she's well and truly gone.::
60293::$$$message_0548_0012_0000$$$::"My duty is to protect you, Shirou."::
60294::$$$message_0548_0013_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60295::$$$message_0548_0013_0001$$$::How many times have I heard those words?[lr]::
60296::$$$message_0548_0013_0002$$$::They were promising, yet anxious.[lr]::
60297::$$$message_0548_0013_0003$$$::...She always put me first.[lr]::
60298::$$$message_0548_0013_0004$$$::Never once did she talk about protecting herself.::
60299::$$$message_0548_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60300::$$$message_0548_0014_0001$$$::I scratch at the blood stain.[lr]::
60301::$$$message_0548_0014_0002$$$::Saber fought and died here.[lr]::
60302::$$$message_0548_0014_0003$$$::That's what war is.[lr]::
60303::$$$message_0548_0014_0004$$$::I've known from the moment we made our pact that people would die in this battle.[lr]::
60304::$$$message_0548_0014_0005$$$::I offered her my hand with that in mind, and she took it.::
60305::$$$message_0548_0015_0000$$$::"Saber..."[lr]::
60306::$$$message_0548_0015_0001$$$::She was a girl smaller than me, who protected me.[lr]::
60307::$$$message_0548_0015_0002$$$::When I decided to go after the black Shadow instead of the Holy Grail, she swallowed her dread and went along with my decision.::
60308::$$$message_0548_0016_0000$$$::...And this is the result.[lr]::
60309::$$$message_0548_0016_0001$$$::I lost her, I'm no longer a Master, and I'm back to being the half-baked "hero" I was before.[lr]::
60310::$$$message_0548_0016_0002$$$::I'm all alone, with no way to fight.[lr]::
60311::$$$message_0548_0016_0003$$$::    But I still have something to do.::
60312::$$$message_0548_0017_0000$$$::"I need to go."[lr]::
60313::$$$message_0548_0017_0001$$$::I touch the blood stain one last time.[lr]::
60314::$$$message_0548_0017_0002$$$::This is farewell.[lr]::
60315::$$$message_0548_0017_0003$$$::I lift my hand away, without a bow or word of thanks.::
60316::$$$message_0548_0018_0000$$$::The pain in my left hand is gone.[lr]::
60317::$$$message_0548_0018_0001$$$::The moment I acknowledged Saber's death and said goodbye,[lr]::
60318::$$$message_0548_0018_0002$$$::my Command Spells disappeared without a trace.::
60319::$$$message_0548_0019_0000$$$::...Command Spells won't disappear just because a Servant is gone.[lr]::
60320::$$$message_0548_0019_0001$$$::They go away when a mage is no longer qualified to be a Master.::
60321::$$$message_0548_0020_0000$$$::"Oh. So I..."[lr]::
60322::$$$message_0548_0020_0001$$$::I have no idea what happened here tonight.[lr]::
60323::$$$message_0548_0020_0002$$$::All I know for certain is one thing: [lr]::
60324::$$$message_0548_0020_0003$$$::In this moment, I lost Saber and the right to be a Master.::
60325::$$$message_0548_0021_0000$$$::...I leave Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
60326::$$$message_0548_0021_0001$$$::My stomach and back feel like big injuries, but right now, I don't care about physical discomfort.::
60327::$$$message_0548_0022_0000$$$::"I will escort you home. It's dangerous to walk alone at night, even if the enemy is gone."[lr]::
60328::$$$message_0548_0022_0001$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
60329::$$$message_0548_0022_0002$$$::I stop, surprised.[lr]::
60330::$$$message_0548_0022_0003$$$::The way Rider is acting is just too unexpected.::
60331::$$$message_0548_0023_0000$$$::"I don't get it. Did your Master order that, too?"[lr]::
60332::$$$message_0548_0023_0001$$$::"No, I've received no such order. I am acting on my personal feelings. I simply thought it was the best thing to do."::
60333::$$$message_0548_0024_0000$$$::"...All right. I can believe that, but I'll pass on the escort. We're enemies. You don't need to go out of your way for me."[lr]::
60334::$$$message_0548_0024_0001$$$::"Enemies... Do you still intend to fight me, then? You, not even a mage and without Saber?"::
60335::$$$message_0548_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60336::$$$message_0548_0025_0001$$$::I don't answer.[lr]::
60337::$$$message_0548_0025_0002$$$::I still haven't said anything about fighting or forfeiting the war.::
60338::$$$message_0548_0026_0000$$$::"I see. Very well, then. Take care on the way home."[lr]::
60339::$$$message_0548_0026_0001$$$::Rider's long hair flutters.[lr]::
60340::$$$message_0548_0026_0002$$$::She heads for the mountain gate ahead of me.[lr]::
60341::$$$message_0548_0026_0003$$$::Even to me, she looks hopelessly defenseless from behind.::
60342::$$$message_0548_0027_0000$$$::"...Thanks."[lr]::
60343::$$$message_0548_0027_0001$$$::I blurt out something I forgot to say.::
60344::$$$message_0548_0028_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
60345::$$$message_0548_0028_0001$$$::She turns around, surprise plain on her face.[lr]::
60346::$$$message_0548_0028_0002$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
60347::$$$message_0548_0028_0003$$$::It's embarrassing to have her look at me like that, but I have to express my gratitude.::
60348::$$$message_0548_0029_0000$$$::"What did you just say?"[lr]::
60349::$$$message_0548_0029_0001$$$::...Because she'll hear me, after all.[lr]::
60350::$$$message_0548_0029_0002$$$::I feel uncomfortable staring her in the eye, so I slightly avert my gaze.::
60351::$$$message_0548_0030_0000$$$::"I-I said thank you. I would've died if you didn't save me.[lr]::
60352::$$$message_0548_0030_0001$$$::...As you can see, I have nothing to pay you back with. So it wouldn't be right unless I thanked you."::
60353::$$$message_0548_0031_0000$$$::"You need not concern yourself with it. I only followed my Master's orders.[lr]::
60354::$$$message_0548_0031_0001$$$::Those same orders could change and tell me to kill you on a moment's notice."[lr]::
60355::$$$message_0548_0031_0002$$$::Rider answers in a cold voice, and disappears through the gate.::
60356::$$$message_0548_0032_0000$$$::"Yeah. That's why I told you not to go out of your way."::
60357::$$$message_0548_0033_0000$$$::I walk out the temple alone.[lr]::
60358::$$$message_0548_0033_0001$$$::I can think about why she came to save me later.[lr]::
60359::$$$message_0548_0033_0002$$$::...It'll take an hour to get home.[lr]::
60360::$$$message_0548_0033_0003$$$::I only have one hour to get over the fact that she should be here with me.­á»
