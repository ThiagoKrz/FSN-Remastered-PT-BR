59993::$$$message_0546_0000_0000$$$::We climb over the "NO TRESPASSING" fence and enter the temple yard.[lr]::
59994::$$$message_0546_0000_0001$$$::Since our encounter with Caster, Ryudou Temple is now treated as important evidence in the mass coma case and closed to the public.::
59995::$$$message_0546_0001_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
59996::$$$message_0546_0001_0001$$$::The air here still feels the same on my skin.[lr]::
59997::$$$message_0546_0001_0002$$$::It's uncomfortably lukewarm, with the smell of ripe fruit.::
59998::$$$message_0546_0002_0000$$$::"...We're going in, Saber."[lr]::
59999::$$$message_0546_0002_0001$$$::"Yes. Be careful, Shirou."[lr]::
60000::$$$message_0546_0002_0002$$$::"I know. Tell me right away if you sense danger."::
60001::$$$message_0546_0003_0000$$$::...We pass through the yard and ascend a corridor leading to the inner temple.[lr]::
60002::$$$message_0546_0003_0001$$$::The hallway is dark, and the wooden floor creaks with our every step.::
60003::$$$message_0546_0004_0000$$$::"...Nothing feels especially off to me. How about you, Saber?"[lr]::
60004::$$$message_0546_0004_0001$$$::"...I feel the same. But I am sure that something is strange about this entire area. Since we stepped foot atop this mountain, we have entered a space governed by a different set of rules.[lr]::
60005::$$$message_0546_0004_0002$$$::In fact, I would say that our failure to notice anything amiss despite the abnormal amount of mana in the air is itself strange."::
60006::$$$message_0546_0005_0000$$$::"...Yeah. Okay, let's see what else we can dig up. There's a pond in the back of the temple, plus several buildings."::
60007::$$$message_0546_0006_0000$$$::It's said that the pond was once home to a dragon.[lr]::
60008::$$$message_0546_0006_0001$$$::We might be able to find some clues there, since it's long been considered a holy place.::
60009::$$$message_0546_0007_0000$$$::We exit the corridor and head for the back of the temple.[lr]::
60010::$$$message_0546_0007_0001$$$::Suddenly[line2][lr]::
60011::$$$message_0546_0007_0002$$$::"Shirou!"[wsay canskip=1]::
60012::$$$message_0546_0008_0000$$$::"Saber!?"[lr]::
60013::$$$message_0546_0008_0001$$$::Something throws me from the corridor into the central shrine.[lr]::
60014::$$$message_0546_0008_0002$$$::I realize that Saber did it, and I try to rush back to her side,[lr]::
60015::$$$message_0546_0008_0003$$$::but Saber slams the door in my face.::
60016::$$$message_0546_0009_0000$$$::"Saber!? What do you think you're doing...!?"[lr]::
60017::$$$message_0546_0009_0001$$$::I pound on the door.[lr]::
60018::$$$message_0546_0009_0002$$$::The door feels as hard as iron. Maybe Saber used some kind of spell on it.::
60019::$$$message_0546_0010_0000$$$::"Damn it! What the hell! Open the door, Saber!"[lr]::
60020::$$$message_0546_0010_0001$$$::I pound and punch the door, but it doesn't budge. It doesn't even give against a full-body tackle.::
60021::$$$message_0546_0011_0000$$$::On the other side of the iron-hard door...[lr]::
60022::$$$message_0546_0011_0001$$$::"Defend yourself, Shirou! This enemy is sure to target you!"::
60023::$$$message_0546_0012_0000$$$::"W-what enemy!? The Shadow!?"[lr]::
60024::$$$message_0546_0012_0001$$$::"No! It is the worst Servant a Master could hope to face! I'm sorry, but I cannot guarantee your safety on this battlefield.[lr]::
60025::$$$message_0546_0012_0002$$$::That Servant[line2]Assassin prefers to kill Masters first, rather than duel other Servants!"::
60026::$$$message_0546_0013_0000$$$::"Assassin!?"[lr]::
60027::$$$message_0546_0013_0001$$$::I didn't sense anything.[lr]::
60028::$$$message_0546_0013_0002$$$::No matter how strange the air in Ryudou Temple feels, a Servant's aura is on a different level.[lr]::
60029::$$$message_0546_0013_0003$$$::When a Servant materializes itself nearby, it gives off an unmistakably dense aura.[lr]::
60030::$$$message_0546_0013_0004$$$::Even if it's hiding its aura, there's no way Saber would fail to sense it!::
60031::$$$message_0546_0014_0000$$$::"I'm going to end this in a single strike. Please stay there!"[lr]::
60032::$$$message_0546_0014_0001$$$::I feel Saber moving away.[lr]::
60033::$$$message_0546_0014_0002$$$::Saber's footsteps are faint but firm. Maybe she's closing in on Assassin while fending off its attacks.::
60034::$$$message_0546_0015_0000$$$::"Damn it. I'd better..."[lr]::
60035::$$$message_0546_0015_0001$$$::I look around me.[lr]::
60036::$$$message_0546_0015_0002$$$::I pick up a kyousaku stick that's handy enough to be a weapon, and immediately start Strengthening it.::
60037::$$$message_0546_0016_0000$$$::"Hurry..."[lr]::
60038::$$$message_0546_0016_0001$$$::I need to use it as a sword to cut the door open.[lr]::
60039::$$$message_0546_0016_0002$$$::A bad hunch, an irritation I can't quite place starts to overtake my mind.[lr]::
60040::$$$message_0546_0016_0003$$$::   If I leave her here...[lr]::
60041::$$$message_0546_0016_0004$$$::If I leave Saber alone on this mountain, there's no going back. I have to hurry up and[line2]::
60042::$$$message_0546_0017_0000$$$::"!?"[lr]::
60043::$$$message_0546_0017_0001$$$::The lights go out.[lr]::
60044::$$$message_0546_0017_0002$$$::No, there were never any lights here to begin with.[lr]::
60045::$$$message_0546_0017_0003$$$::The moonlight that was illuminating the shrine is snuffed out.::
60046::$$$message_0546_0018_0000$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
60047::$$$message_0546_0018_0001$$$::Something reeks.[lr]::
60048::$$$message_0546_0018_0002$$$::It's the odor of rotting meat, and the grating buzz of insect wings.::
60049::$$$message_0546_0019_0000$$$::"Zouken Matou."[lr]::
60050::$$$message_0546_0019_0001$$$::I stare into the darkness.[lr]::
60051::$$$message_0546_0019_0002$$$::"Heh. Like a moth to the flame, young Emiya brat."[lr]::
60052::$$$message_0546_0019_0003$$$::He cackles.[lr]::
60053::$$$message_0546_0019_0004$$$::Somewhere out there, I feel the old mage's unmistakable, fiendish aura.::
60054::$$$message_0546_0020_0000$$$::"Saber..."[lr]::
60055::$$$message_0546_0020_0001$$$::I take a stance with my improvised weapon.[lr]::
60056::$$$message_0546_0020_0002$$$::I'm not afraid of this centuries-old fiend.[lr]::
60057::$$$message_0546_0020_0003$$$::The absent Saber's well-being is the only thing on my mind.::
