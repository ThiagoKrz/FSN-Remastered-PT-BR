3749::$$$message_0039_0000_0000$$$::I go back to the house.[lr]::
3750::$$$message_0039_0000_0001$$$::I decide to keep quiet about meeting Illya.[lr]::
3751::$$$message_0039_0000_0002$$$::This is the sort of thing I should be sharing right away, and I know it, but I don't feel like talking about it.::
3752::$$$message_0039_0001_0000$$$::Illya wasn't acting like a Master in the park.[lr]::
3753::$$$message_0039_0001_0001$$$::We talked about trivial things, and casually parted ways.[lr]::
3754::$$$message_0039_0001_0002$$$::So I hesitate to bring up what happened today to the others.[lr]::
3755::$$$message_0039_0001_0003$$$::I feel bad for keeping secrets, but I don't want to think of the little girl I met today as my enemy.::
3756::$$$message_0039_0002_0000$$$::After lunch with Saber, we resume our training at the dojo, and next thing I know, it's time for dinner.[lr]::
3757::$$$message_0039_0002_0001$$$::I rest, fatigued after my training with Saber, so I take a bath to rinse the sweat off.[lr]::
3758::$$$message_0039_0002_0002$$$::By the time I head to the living room, dinner is ready.::
3759::$$$message_0039_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
3760::$$$message_0039_0003_0001$$$::I'm a little moved.[lr]::
3761::$$$message_0039_0003_0002$$$::It's really nice to come out of the bath and find dinner ready, without doing anything.::
3762::$$$message_0039_0004_0000$$$::"Emiya. It's dinnertime... Why are you standing there like an idiot?"[lr]::
3763::$$$message_0039_0004_0001$$$::And yet...[lr]::
3764::$$$message_0039_0004_0002$$$::Why does she have to ruin the moment?::
3765::$$$message_0039_0005_0000$$$::"Nothing. It's dinner, right? I'm ready to eat. Where's Saber?"[lr]::
3766::$$$message_0039_0005_0001$$$::"Hmmm? I thought Saber went to your room, Shirou. You didn't see her? That's weird. She was here a second ago."::
3767::$$$message_0039_0006_0000$$$::"Maybe you two missed each other because this place is as big as a hotel. Fine, I'll go get Saber, so you should go to the bathroom one more time. You didn't dry your hair properly."::
3768::$$$message_0039_0007_0000$$$::"Oh, you're right. Okay, then, I'll leave Saber to you."[lr]::
3769::$$$message_0039_0007_0001$$$::I wave to Tohsaka and step back into the hallway.::
3770::$$$message_0039_0008_0000$$$::As Tohsaka said, the Emiya house was built with all kinds of passages and corridors.[lr]::
3771::$$$message_0039_0008_0001$$$::One of the most notable examples of this is the various routes to the bathroom. You can get there from my room or the living room.::
3772::$$$message_0039_0009_0000$$$::I head into the bathroom.[lr]::
3773::$$$message_0039_0009_0001$$$::I don't like to use the dryer, so I'll just use the towel I used earlier to dry my hair.[lr]::
3774::$$$message_0039_0009_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
3775::$$$message_0039_0009_0003$$$::And in that moment...[lr]::
3776::$$$message_0039_0009_0004$$$::I forget everything that happened today.::
3777::$$$message_0039_0010_0000$$$::"Shirou."::
3778::$$$message_0039_0011_0000$$$::"I suppose you must be here to take another bath, but I am doing so at the moment. I would appreciate if you could wait until later."::
3779::$$$message_0039_0012_0000$$$::"Ah...uh...ah...um...um..."[lr]::
3780::$$$message_0039_0012_0001$$$::I need to explain myself.[lr]::
3781::$$$message_0039_0012_0002$$$::I need to explain that this is all an accident, but my mind has gone completely blank.[lr]::
3782::$$$message_0039_0012_0003$$$::The sight in front of me is enough to erase everything that's happened today from my mind.::
3783::$$$message_0039_0013_0000$$$::"S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S..."[lr]::
3784::$$$message_0039_0013_0001$$$::"Shirou, were you in the bath so long that all your blood rushed to your head? Even your ears are bright red. If you need to cool off, I suggest you head out onto the veranda."[lr]::
3785::$$$message_0039_0013_0002$$$::"Uh. No, yeah...I'll do that. But before I do, I should apologize."::
3786::$$$message_0039_0014_0000$$$::I avert my gaze from Saber, and try to calm my pounding heart.::
3787::$$$message_0039_0015_0000$$$::"This was an accident. Well, actually, there's not really much room for me to explain myself now that we've actually run into each other like this... So, go on, get mad at me, Saber."[lr]::
3788::$$$message_0039_0015_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
3789::$$$message_0039_0015_0002$$$::I try to keep my eyes averted and calm myself down at the same time.::
3790::$$$message_0039_0016_0000$$$::Saber thinks for a while, then says,[lr]::
3791::$$$message_0039_0016_0001$$$::"Shirou. Please raise your head."::
3792::$$$message_0039_0017_0000$$$::"Uh...ummm..."[lr]::
3793::$$$message_0039_0017_0001$$$::I do as I'm told.[lr]::
3794::$$$message_0039_0017_0002$$$::"Hey wait! Why are you still...like that!?"::
3795::$$$message_0039_0018_0000$$$::"You have nothing to apologize for. I wish to tell you that there is nothing for you to worry about, even having seen what you have."::
3796::$$$message_0039_0019_0000$$$::"Um...come again?"[lr]::
3797::$$$message_0039_0019_0001$$$::"I have told you this before. Gender is meaningless to Servants.[lr]::
3798::$$$message_0039_0019_0002$$$::Seeing my body may have made you panic, but as I have said, I am a Servant before I am a woman. As such, your consideration is unnecessary."::
3799::$$$message_0039_0020_0000$$$::"What...!?"[lr]::
3800::$$$message_0039_0020_0001$$$::What is Saber saying!?[lr]::
3801::$$$message_0039_0020_0002$$$::Even if Saber insists, the fact of the matter remains that she's a girl.[lr]::
3802::$$$message_0039_0020_0003$$$::But then again...[lr]::
3803::$$$message_0039_0020_0004$$$::I don't think it'd be the case, but could Saber be...?::
3804::$$$message_0039_0021_0000$$$::"Let me ask you something: Are you saying you're not the least embarrassed about changing in front of me, Saber?"[lr]::
3805::$$$message_0039_0021_0001$$$::"Hm? Why should I be embarrassed about such a thing?"[lr]::
3806::$$$message_0039_0021_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
3807::$$$message_0039_0021_0003$$$::I figured as much.[lr]::
3808::$$$message_0039_0021_0004$$$::It doesn't matter that Saber doesn't care though. I really do.::
3809::$$$message_0039_0022_0000$$$::"Sorry. Just let me apologize. If something like this happens again, you can do whatever you want with me."[lr]::
3810::$$$message_0039_0022_0001$$$::I do a quick one-eighty, and rush awkwardly out of the dressing room.::
3811::$$$message_0039_0023_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
3812::$$$message_0039_0023_0001$$$::Saber stares after me oddly as I leave.::
