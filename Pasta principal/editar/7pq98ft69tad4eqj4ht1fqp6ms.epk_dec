72865::$$$message_0668_0000_0001$$$::The collapse is all but assured.[lr]::
72866::$$$message_0668_0000_0002$$$::The Einzberns' thousand-year quest.[lr]::
72867::$$$message_0668_0000_0003$$$::The Makiris' five-hundred-year wish.[lr]::
72868::$$$message_0668_0000_0004$$$::A world that has continued without ending, changing, or evolving is finally coming to an end.::
72869::$$$message_0668_0001_0000$$$::"Oh... Oh, ohhhhhhh!!!"[lr]::
72870::$$$message_0668_0001_0001$$$::Amidst the destruction, it still has a will.::
72871::$$$message_0668_0002_0000$$$::                                           [line4]I don't want to die.[line4]::
72872::$$$message_0668_0003_0000$$$::Its body is nothing but a dark red lump of meat, looking nothing like a human.[lr]::
72873::$$$message_0668_0003_0001$$$::It is a swarm of insects that dwelled in this cavern.[lr]::
72874::$$$message_0668_0003_0002$$$::He gathered them all to form a single lump of flesh, but he cannot maintain a humanoid body anymore.::
72875::$$$message_0668_0004_0000$$$::His writhing form is simply a lump of meat that can move.[lr]::
72876::$$$message_0668_0004_0001$$$::But it's still alive.[lr]::
72877::$$$message_0668_0004_0002$$$::The lump curses its rotting body and its melting soul.::

72881::$$$message_0668_0007_0001$$$::It crawls on the ground.[lr]::
72882::$$$message_0668_0007_0002$$$::Zouken Makiri. The old mage, his main body anchoring his soul having been crushed, clings to this world by his obsession alone.[lr]::
72883::$$$message_0668_0007_0003$$$::His doom is only a matter of time.[lr]::
72884::$$$message_0668_0007_0004$$$::Although he has fit his soul into a hastily-assembled swarm of insects, he will never recover from being crushed twice.::

72886::$$$message_0668_0009_0000$$$::The old mage who has become a lump of meat will die an agonizing death.[lr]::
72887::$$$message_0668_0009_0001$$$::He will rot until the end, and die feeling regret.[lr]::
72888::$$$message_0668_0009_0002$$$::It's right in front of him.[lr]::
72889::$$$message_0668_0009_0003$$$::He gazes out at the embodiment of eternity which he sought for so long and was only one step away from obtaining.::
72890::$$$message_0668_0010_0000$$$::Are his death cries agony, or regret?::
72891::$$$message_0668_0011_0000$$$::                                           [line4]I don't want to die.[line4]::
72892::$$$message_0668_0012_0000$$$::He doesn't want to die.[lr]::
72893::$$$message_0668_0012_0001$$$::How can he just disappear now?[lr]::
72894::$$$message_0668_0012_0002$$$::Five hundred years.[lr]::
72895::$$$message_0668_0012_0003$$$::How can he disappear when the reward he deserves for five hundred agonizing years of effort is right before his eyes?::
72896::$$$message_0668_0013_0000$$$::"Oh... Oh, ohhhhhhhh!"[lr]::
72897::$$$message_0668_0013_0001$$$::All he remembers is suffering.[lr]::
72898::$$$message_0668_0013_0002$$$::The karma of the Makiris.[lr]::
72899::$$$message_0668_0013_0003$$$::They were a great magical house driven from their homeland, wandering until reaching this land in the Orient. Then, they were unable to assimilate to this land's laws and fell into decline.[lr]::
72900::$$$message_0668_0013_0004$$$::   But that wasn't true.[lr]::
72901::$$$message_0668_0013_0005$$$::There would have still been hope if that was the case.[lr]::
72902::$$$message_0668_0013_0006$$$::If that is why their bloodline died out, they might have gracefully accepted their demise.::
72903::$$$message_0668_0014_0000$$$::                                           [line4]I don't want to die.[line4]::
72904::$$$message_0668_0015_0000$$$::But the truth was different.[lr]::
72905::$$$message_0668_0015_0001$$$::It isn't that the land of Japan was unsuitable.[lr]::
72906::$$$message_0668_0015_0002$$$::An external factor like that wouldn't have ended the Makiris.[lr]::
72907::$$$message_0668_0015_0003$$$::They simply lost their way.::
72908::$$$message_0668_0016_0000$$$::It has been three hundred years since the ancestral Makiri seekers.[lr]::
72909::$$$message_0668_0016_0001$$$::In those three hundred years, they reached the limits of their lineage.[lr]::
72910::$$$message_0668_0016_0002$$$::The Makiri mages were already in decline by Zouken's generation.[lr]::
72911::$$$message_0668_0016_0003$$$::That is when the suffering began, and the old man had no choice but to deny it.[lr]::
72912::$$$message_0668_0016_0004$$$::Zouken Matou's life was spent desperately trying to overcome the decline of the Makiri bloodline.::
72913::$$$message_0668_0017_0000$$$::    I don't want to die.[lr]::
72914::$$$message_0668_0017_0001$$$::I don't want to die, I don't want to die...!::
72915::$$$message_0668_0018_0000$$$::"Oh, oohh, OOOOOOOOOHHHH!!!"[lr]::
72916::$$$message_0668_0018_0001$$$::Yes, I must not die. Damn this rotting body. It's painful, so painful. Too painful. Five hundred years of pain. My whole life has been pain. Why fault me for seeking eternity? I suffered and suffered, never fulfilled, so how can I disappear without leaving anything behind? How can I die in agony? The Holy Grail is open before me. So listen to my wish, ask and I shall answer. My wish is that I DON'T WANT TO DIE, I need to get there, my wish will come true if I climb that cliff, it'll grant my wish but I can't reach it with this body, it's so far away, these last five centuries have been for nothing, it's so far away, why oh why is it so far away[line16]!?!?!?::
72917::$$$message_0668_0019_0000$$$::He crawls, scattering and splattering his body.[lr]::
72918::$$$message_0668_0019_0001$$$::What obsession.[lr]::
72919::$$$message_0668_0019_0002$$$::He can't move, no, he shouldn't even have the ability to move, but his hatred drives it forward.::
72920::$$$message_0668_0020_0000$$$::He is now an obsessive idea become a monster.[lr]::
72921::$$$message_0668_0020_0001$$$::He doesn't hear the collapse. He only sees the Holy Grail as it moves forward.[lr]::
72922::$$$message_0668_0020_0002$$$::And then, his misshapen form sees...[lr]::
72923::$$$message_0668_0020_0003$$$::"...So you've changed this much, Makiri."[lr]::
72924::$$$message_0668_0020_0004$$$::Someone with a beautiful, bell-like voice speaks to him.::
72925::$$$message_0668_0021_0000$$$::"What...?"[lr]::
72926::$$$message_0668_0021_0001$$$::He looks up.[lr]::
72927::$$$message_0668_0021_0002$$$::In the middle of his wavering vision[lr]::
72928::$$$message_0668_0021_0003$$$::stands a lone girl.::
72929::$$$message_0668_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72930::$$$message_0668_0022_0001$$$::He stops.[lr]::
72931::$$$message_0668_0022_0002$$$::He stares at her.[lr]::
72932::$$$message_0668_0022_0003$$$::...The old mage does not see a girl.[lr]::
72933::$$$message_0668_0022_0004$$$::He sees a woman from his distant memories.[lr]::
72934::$$$message_0668_0022_0005$$$::The golden Einzbern woman who has never faded from his mind to this day.[lr]::
72935::$$$message_0668_0022_0006$$$::   Two hundred years ago...[lr]::
72936::$$$message_0668_0022_0007$$$::She was his comrade[line2]the Cup of Heaven who sacrificed herself to build the Greater Grail.::
72937::$$$message_0668_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72938::$$$message_0668_0023_0001$$$::She hasn't changed at all since that day.[lr]::
72939::$$$message_0668_0023_0002$$$::The woman of the Holy Grail looks at him with the same eyes as when he still burned with passion.[lr]::
72940::$$$message_0668_0023_0003$$$::"Tell me, my nemesis. Why did you not want to die?"[lr]::
72941::$$$message_0668_0023_0004$$$::She speaks just once, in a nostalgic voice.::
72942::$$$message_0668_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72943::$$$message_0668_0024_0001$$$::Her question halts his thoughts of suffering.[lr]::
72944::$$$message_0668_0024_0002$$$::Why?[lr]::
72945::$$$message_0668_0024_0003$$$::Why?[lr]::
72946::$$$message_0668_0024_0004$$$::Why?[lr]::
72947::$$$message_0668_0024_0005$$$::It's strange, now that one asks.[lr]::
72948::$$$message_0668_0024_0006$$$::Why did he not want to die?[lr]::
72949::$$$message_0668_0024_0007$$$::Why couldn't he die?[lr]::
72950::$$$message_0668_0024_0008$$$::He would be free from suffering in death, so for what purpose did he cling to life and suffering?::
72951::$$$message_0668_0025_0000$$$::"Oh...Ohh, oooohhhh."[lr]::
72952::$$$message_0668_0025_0001$$$::He remembers.::
72953::$$$message_0668_0026_0000$$$::Yes, he had a noble goal at first.[lr]::
72954::$$$message_0668_0026_0001$$$::He would acquire all of creation.[lr]::
72955::$$$message_0668_0026_0002$$$::He would know all truths,[lr]::
72956::$$$message_0668_0026_0003$$$::and reach lands nobody else could.[lr]::
72957::$$$message_0668_0026_0004$$$::He would surpass the limits of the flesh and reach the limitlessness of the soul.::
72958::$$$message_0668_0027_0000$$$::The human race.[lr]::
72959::$$$message_0668_0027_0001$$$::He would let those saddled with limits from birth and forced to run circles within the spiral of their brains go outside.[lr]::
72960::$$$message_0668_0027_0002$$$::To heal all hatred and suffering.::
72961::$$$message_0668_0028_0000$$$::    He remembers.[lr]::
72962::$$$message_0668_0028_0001$$$::It was after the grief of learning that Paradise did not exist.[lr]::
72963::$$$message_0668_0028_0002$$$::He excitedly decided that if it did not exist in this world and he was not allowed to create it while in a flesh body, then he would travel to a place where it was allowed.[lr]::
72964::$$$message_0668_0028_0003$$$::Not to create a new world, but to turn himself, to turn the life called humanity into something new.::
72965::$$$message_0668_0029_0000$$$::"Oh...ohh."[lr]::
72966::$$$message_0668_0029_0001$$$::...That's right.[lr]::
72967::$$$message_0668_0029_0002$$$::To go to the sky he always looked up at, and beyond.[lr]::
72968::$$$message_0668_0029_0003$$$::He would be born anew in a place no one could imagine,[lr]::
72969::$$$message_0668_0029_0004$$$::and arrive at a utopia we cannot visualize.::
72970::$$$message_0668_0030_0000$$$::    For that cause...[lr]::
72971::$$$message_0668_0030_0001$$$::He sought the Holy Grail.[lr]::
72972::$$$message_0668_0030_0002$$$::He sought a miracle beyond human reach.[lr]::
72973::$$$message_0668_0030_0003$$$::He couldn't disappear until he attained it.[lr]::
72974::$$$message_0668_0030_0004$$$::He knew he would suffer defeat and that he would not attain it in this body, but he never gave up as long as he lived.::
72975::$$$message_0668_0031_0000$$$::                                 Yes, he had just one dream.[lr]::
72976::$$$message_0668_0031_0001$$$::                                 The abolition of all the evil in the world.[lr]::
72977::$$$message_0668_0031_0002$$$::                                 We staked our lives on an impossible utopia.::
72978::$$$message_0668_0032_0000$$$::"......Oh."[lr]::
72979::$$$message_0668_0032_0001$$$::So he stayed behind.[lr]::
72980::$$$message_0668_0032_0002$$$::After his enemies left, he kept searching, even as he knew it was pointless.[lr]::
72981::$$$message_0668_0032_0003$$$::He believed that living itself had purpose, and knew that one day he would create someone to succeed him.::
72982::$$$message_0668_0033_0000$$$::So he kept on living.[lr]::
72983::$$$message_0668_0033_0001$$$::It was suffering, but he couldn't let himself die.[lr]::
72984::$$$message_0668_0033_0002$$$::Even when he remade himself, he never overcame the laments of his youth.[lr]::
72985::$$$message_0668_0033_0003$$$::Was that not his way of life, and the answer he arrived at?::
72986::$$$message_0668_0034_0000$$$::...Yes.[lr]::
72987::$$$message_0668_0034_0001$$$::Even if it lies beyond this life. Even if he isn't rewarded...::
72988::$$$message_0668_0035_0000$$$::"Oh... Oohh, oh...!"[lr]::
72989::$$$message_0668_0035_0001$$$::That was his first wish.[lr]::
72990::$$$message_0668_0035_0002$$$::That agony.[lr]::
72991::$$$message_0668_0035_0003$$$::How meager his wish to not die was, compared to his quest for an impossible dream...!::
72992::$$$message_0668_0036_0000$$$::"...I see. It once was that way, Justeaze."[lr]::
72993::$$$message_0668_0036_0001$$$::...He looks up at the world.[lr]::
72994::$$$message_0668_0036_0002$$$::The cavern is already halfway to total collapse.[lr]::
72995::$$$message_0668_0036_0003$$$::Sakura Matou has been liberated and taken from this world.[lr]::
72996::$$$message_0668_0036_0004$$$::Aŋra Mainiiu, the birthed, completely flawed embodiment of the Third Magic is flickering like heat haze.[lr]::
72997::$$$message_0668_0036_0005$$$::   Finally...[lr]::
72998::$$$message_0668_0036_0006$$$::the old mage accepts that he will never reach any of it.::
72999::$$$message_0668_0037_0000$$$::"It's over.[lr]::
73000::$$$message_0668_0037_0001$$$::My old wish, my agony, the Makiris' duty... it all ends here."[lr]::
73001::$$$message_0668_0037_0002$$$::It was decided from the very beginning.[lr]::
73002::$$$message_0668_0037_0003$$$::Wherever the Makiris' voyage ended would be their final resting place.::
73003::$$$message_0668_0038_0000$$$::"Ha... Haha, hahaha."[lr]::
73004::$$$message_0668_0038_0001$$$::And yet...[lr]::
73005::$$$message_0668_0038_0002$$$::The end of their long suffering was not a wretched conclusion at all.::
73006::$$$message_0668_0039_0000$$$::It has only just begun.[lr]::
73007::$$$message_0668_0039_0001$$$::Their challenges and journeys have just begun.[lr]::
73008::$$$message_0668_0039_0002$$$::Five hundred years is a trifle.[lr]::
73009::$$$message_0668_0039_0003$$$::Far too short a time to accomplish anything.[lr]::
73010::$$$message_0668_0039_0004$$$::What we desired was brilliant and precious, to be attained in the far future[line2][lr]::
73011::$$$message_0668_0039_0005$$$::the maturation of humanity, whether it takes thousands or tens of thousands of years.::
73012::$$$message_0668_0040_0000$$$::So this is but a trifling setback at the start of the journey, albeit a meaningful one.[lr]::
73013::$$$message_0668_0040_0001$$$::Their wish is not over.[lr]::
73014::$$$message_0668_0040_0002$$$::The journey begins now.[lr]::
73015::$$$message_0668_0040_0003$$$::The history of their long, long journey to reach the great, great beyond begins its loop with the end of a dream.::
73016::$$$message_0668_0041_0000$$$::"...But it's too bad. I really was just one step away."[lr]::
73017::$$$message_0668_0041_0001$$$::The words of resignation belong to the old mage after all.[lr]::
73018::$$$message_0668_0041_0002$$$::No matter how brilliant his objective, he is a fiend who approves of wicked deeds.[lr]::
73019::$$$message_0668_0041_0003$$$::He never overcame that trait even at the end, and cut his obsession with life.::
73020::$$$message_0668_0042_0000$$$::    The last one disappears.[lr]::
73021::$$$message_0668_0042_0001$$$::One of the mages sought a miracle, an observer who was there at the very beginning, crumbles away.::
73022::$$$message_0668_0043_0000$$$::"Five hundred years... Heh. That wish went by in the blink of an eye."[lr]::
73023::$$$message_0668_0043_0001$$$::The lump of meat is swallowed by the rubble, leaving no trace.::
73024::$$$message_0668_0044_0000$$$::He was a creature which lived while transforming.[lr]::
73025::$$$message_0668_0044_0001$$$::The old mage completely disappears from the world, along with the fall of his long-sought wish.::
