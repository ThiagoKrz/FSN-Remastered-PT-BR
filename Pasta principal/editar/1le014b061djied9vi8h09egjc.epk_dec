40313::$$$message_0348_0000_0000$$$::It feels like I just got punched.[lr]::
40314::$$$message_0348_0000_0001$$$::"...Oh."[lr]::
40315::$$$message_0348_0000_0002$$$::I wake up from the pain in my shoulder.[lr]::
40316::$$$message_0348_0000_0003$$$::...My body is still intact.[lr]::
40317::$$$message_0348_0000_0004$$$::I can still feel my limbs and hear the sound of my own breathing.[lr]::
40318::$$$message_0348_0000_0005$$$::My shoulder is wrapped in a bandage, and the bed I'm sleeping in is soft.::
40319::$$$message_0348_0001_0000$$$::"...Huh? This place... Is...?"[lr]::
40320::$$$message_0348_0001_0001$$$::...An unfamiliar room.[lr]::
40321::$$$message_0348_0001_0002$$$::If I remember correctly... Someone said something.::
40322::$$$message_0348_0002_0000$$$::                      This is it. You don't have to fight anymore, Shirou...::
40323::$$$message_0348_0003_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
40324::$$$message_0348_0003_0001$$$::I get up.[lr]::
40325::$$$message_0348_0003_0002$$$::I remember everything and jump out of bed...[lr]::
40326::$$$message_0348_0003_0003$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
40327::$$$message_0348_0003_0004$$$::Pain causes my back to arch.::
40328::$$$message_0348_0004_0000$$$::"Agh... Khh...!"[lr]::
40329::$$$message_0348_0004_0001$$$::...I touch my left shoulder.[lr]::
40330::$$$message_0348_0004_0002$$$::It still burns like fire.[lr]::
40331::$$$message_0348_0004_0003$$$::It feels much worse than a pulled muscle.[lr]::
40332::$$$message_0348_0004_0004$$$::Well, I'm lucky that my arm is still attached since it was pierced through with a sword, but... Honestly... It hurts badly.::
40333::$$$message_0348_0005_0000$$$::"Guh... Ah, ah, ha..."[lr]::
40334::$$$message_0348_0005_0001$$$::I slowly get out of bed.[lr]::
40335::$$$message_0348_0005_0002$$$::If I clench my teeth, I can somehow bear this pain.[lr]::
40336::$$$message_0348_0005_0003$$$::Then...::
40337::$$$message_0348_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40338::$$$message_0348_0006_0001$$$::...The heat from my shoulder reaches my head.[lr]::
40339::$$$message_0348_0006_0002$$$::I shake that off and move my legs.::
40340::$$$message_0348_0006_0003$$$::"...No one's... Here?"[lr]::
40341::$$$message_0348_0006_0004$$$::Yeah, there shouldn't be anyone.[lr]::
40342::$$$message_0348_0006_0005$$$::I remember Tohsaka's words.[lr]::
40343::$$$message_0348_0006_0006$$$::She said those words and left.[lr]::
40344::$$$message_0348_0006_0007$$$::So, she must've gone out to fight by herself.::
40345::$$$message_0348_0006_0008$$$::"Haah... Haah, ah..."[lr]::
40346::$$$message_0348_0006_0009$$$::I head to the door.[lr]::
40347::$$$message_0348_0006_0010$$$::I must go outside.[lr]::
40348::$$$message_0348_0006_0011$$$::I need to go outside and find Tohsaka.::
40349::$$$message_0348_0006_0012$$$::"Khh..."[lr]::
40350::$$$message_0348_0006_0013$$$::I'm going to fall.[lr]::
40351::$$$message_0348_0006_0014$$$::I almost fall, so I support myself using the dressing table.[lr]::
40352::$$$message_0348_0006_0015$$$::"Guh..."[lr]::
40353::$$$message_0348_0006_0016$$$::...It's useless.[lr]::
40354::$$$message_0348_0006_0017$$$::I fall to the floor along with the dressing table that I leaned on.::
40355::$$$message_0348_0007_0000$$$::"Sorry... I made a mess, Tohsaka."[lr]::
40356::$$$message_0348_0007_0001$$$::I collect the scattered accessories and put them back.[lr]::
40357::$$$message_0348_0007_0002$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
40358::$$$message_0348_0007_0003$$$::I see something familiar amongst them.::
40359::$$$message_0348_0008_0000$$$::"...I've seen this before..."[lr]::
40360::$$$message_0348_0008_0001$$$::I've seen this somewhere.[lr]::
40361::$$$message_0348_0008_0002$$$::...Yeah, it was like this back then too.[lr]::
40362::$$$message_0348_0008_0003$$$::The night I got stabbed in the chest by Lancer.[lr]::
40363::$$$message_0348_0008_0004$$$::I got a fatal wound, and it was healed before I knew it.[lr]::
40364::$$$message_0348_0008_0005$$$::I think there was something I picked up when I left the hallway with a sluggish body.::
40365::$$$message_0348_0009_0000$$$::It's hot.[lr]::
40366::$$$message_0348_0009_0001$$$::The poison from my shoulder circulates to my brain and makes me lax.::
40367::$$$message_0348_0010_0000$$$::"...Yeah. This is the same one..."[lr]::
40368::$$$message_0348_0010_0001$$$::I can tell, but I can't gather my thoughts.[lr]::
40369::$$$message_0348_0010_0002$$$::Things that I had believed were dreams until now…[lr]::
40370::$$$message_0348_0010_0003$$$::Or whose Servant was fighting Lancer at that time…[lr]::
40371::$$$message_0348_0010_0004$$$::Or who could save me when I was dying, and who had the necessity to be there...::
40372::$$$message_0348_0011_0000$$$::...There's no need to think about those things anymore, yet my head is spinning.::
40373::$$$message_0348_0012_0000$$$::"...Damn it. She talked about owing me and all, but this is something I can never pay back..."[lr]::
40374::$$$message_0348_0012_0001$$$::I feel dizzy.[lr]::
40375::$$$message_0348_0012_0002$$$::I'm a mess from the pain, heat, and my own stupidity.::
40376::$$$message_0348_0013_0000$$$::"Haah... Ah..."[lr]::
40377::$$$message_0348_0013_0001$$$::I move my legs.[lr]::
40378::$$$message_0348_0013_0002$$$::Anyway, I have to look for her now.[lr]::
40379::$$$message_0348_0013_0003$$$::I have something I want to say, and now I have something I have to tell her.[lr]::
40380::$$$message_0348_0013_0004$$$::That's all I can think about with this brain that's as mushy as stew...::
40381::$$$message_0348_0014_0000$$$::"Haah... Haah, haah, ah..."[lr]::
40382::$$$message_0348_0014_0001$$$::I was in front of the train station before I realized it.[lr]::
40383::$$$message_0348_0014_0002$$$::My hazy mind moves with only vague images.[lr]::
40384::$$$message_0348_0014_0003$$$::...That she's there.[lr]::
40385::$$$message_0348_0014_0004$$$::It's ordering me to go there to look for her.::
40386::$$$message_0348_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40387::$$$message_0348_0015_0001$$$::...I don't know why I'm drawn here.[lr]::
40388::$$$message_0348_0015_0002$$$::My boiled brain only thought of this building.::
40389::$$$message_0348_0016_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
40390::$$$message_0348_0016_0001$$$::...Then, I can only follow my instincts.[lr]::
40391::$$$message_0348_0016_0002$$$::I don't have any other way to find Tohsaka to start with.[lr]::
40392::$$$message_0348_0016_0003$$$::Whatever that may be, I can only cling to something.::
40393::$$$message_0348_0017_0000$$$::    I go out to the rooftop.[lr]::
40394::$$$message_0348_0017_0001$$$::The wind that blows high up is cold and cools my heated head down a bit.[lr]::
40395::$$$message_0348_0017_0002$$$::"...Why are you here?"[lr]::
40396::$$$message_0348_0017_0003$$$::A faint gasp.[lr]::
40397::$$$message_0348_0017_0004$$$::Tohsaka was looking down at the town from the rooftop, just as she had been that night.::
40398::$$$message_0348_0018_0000$$$::"Go home. I don't know why you're here, but you're an eyesore."[lr]::
40399::$$$message_0348_0018_0001$$$::She looks at me angrily.[lr]::
40400::$$$message_0348_0018_0002$$$::Behind me...[lr]::
40401::$$$message_0348_0018_0003$$$::There is someone silently telling me that it's not my turn.::
40402::$$$message_0348_0019_0000$$$::"I'm not leaving. I'll leave with you. We promised that we're going to fight together, right?"[lr]::
40403::$$$message_0348_0019_0001$$$::I pull my hazy mind together with force and somehow move my mouth.::
40404::$$$message_0348_0020_0000$$$::"Forget about that promise. First of all, what can you even do now? Without Saber, you're no match for a Master."[lr]::
40405::$$$message_0348_0020_0001$$$::"...That is[line2]"::
40406::$$$message_0348_0021_0000$$$::"Besides, there's no need for you to fight anymore.[lr]::
40407::$$$message_0348_0021_0001$$$::You're not a Master anymore, so it's safe if you escape to the church. You just need to stay there and the Holy Grail War will come to an end."::
40408::$$$message_0348_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40409::$$$message_0348_0022_0001$$$::I almost faint hearing those words.[lr]::
40410::$$$message_0348_0022_0002$$$::"Don't be ridiculous, I can't leave Saber like that...![lr]::
40411::$$$message_0348_0022_0003$$$::Look, I already said I'm going to fight. So, I'm going to fight until the end no matter[line2]"::
40412::$$$message_0348_0023_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
40413::$$$message_0348_0023_0001$$$::My vision turns red.[lr]::
40414::$$$message_0348_0023_0002$$$::I can't... talk.[lr]::
40415::$$$message_0348_0023_0003$$$::Just by yelling, all the muscles in my body cramp up and I feel like I'm going to die.::
40416::$$$message_0348_0024_0000$$$::"Look at yourself. You've had Saber's help until now, but that's what happens without it.[lr]::
40417::$$$message_0348_0024_0001$$$::...Look, Emiya. Humans die if they get wounded. Your wound should be fatal."::
40418::$$$message_0348_0025_0000$$$::"Ah... Haah, ah... Ah"[lr]::
40419::$$$message_0348_0025_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...Damn it.[font italic=false][lr]::
40420::$$$message_0348_0025_0002$$$::I know that already.[lr]::
40421::$$$message_0348_0025_0003$$$::I know, but I'm in so much pain that the words I need to say can't come out…::
40422::$$$message_0348_0026_0000$$$::"And as for Saber, that's not a problem you should worry about.[lr]::
40423::$$$message_0348_0026_0001$$$::You're not a Master anymore, so what happens to Saber doesn't concern you."::
40424::$$$message_0348_0027_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40425::$$$message_0348_0027_0001$$$::It does... concern me.[lr]::
40426::$$$message_0348_0027_0002$$$::This pain is proof that I've been saved by Saber until now.::
40427::$$$message_0348_0028_0000$$$::"...No, even if I'm not... A Master.[lr]::
40428::$$$message_0348_0028_0001$$$::Saber hated it. How can I let her be controlled by someone like that...!?"::
40429::$$$message_0348_0029_0000$$$::"...Yes. But you're powerless.[lr]::
40430::$$$message_0348_0029_0001$$$::...It's fine, if you refuse to admit it, then I'll say it for you.[lr]::
40431::$$$message_0348_0029_0002$$$::You can't save Saber with the way you are right now."::
40432::$$$message_0348_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40433::$$$message_0348_0030_0001$$$::The heat disappears.[lr]::
40434::$$$message_0348_0030_0002$$$::Even the boiling in my mind froze with those cold-hearted words.::
40435::$$$message_0348_0031_0000$$$::"End of conversation.[lr]::
40436::$$$message_0348_0031_0001$$$::Without Saber, you're no longer a Master.[lr]::
40437::$$$message_0348_0031_0002$$$::There's no reason for you to be involved in the kill fest called the Holy Grail War, so withdraw now."::
40438::$$$message_0348_0032_0000$$$::Tohsaka turns around and leaves.::
40439::$$$message_0348_0033_0000$$$::"Ugh...!"[lr]::
40440::$$$message_0348_0033_0001$$$::Amidst the wind blowing at the building…[lr]::
40441::$$$message_0348_0033_0002$$$::Tohsaka kicks the ground, without any hesitation.[lr]::
40442::$$$message_0348_0033_0003$$$::"Idio[line2]Idiot, what are you thinking...!?"[lr]::
40443::$$$message_0348_0033_0004$$$::I reach out frantically.::
40444::$$$message_0348_0034_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40445::$$$message_0348_0034_0001$$$::There's no need for that.[lr]::
40446::$$$message_0348_0034_0002$$$::The red knight appears beside Tohsaka, as if to protect her.[lr]::
40447::$$$message_0348_0034_0003$$$::Even if she jumps from this height, she should be able to land without a problem if she has a Servant.::
40448::$$$message_0348_0035_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40449::$$$message_0348_0035_0001$$$::Tohsaka's lips move slightly.[lr]::
40450::$$$message_0348_0035_0002$$$::...I can't hear what she said.[lr]::
40451::$$$message_0348_0035_0003$$$::But her eyes that look at me...::
40452::$$$message_0348_0036_0000$$$::       You'll die if you get involved any longer.::
40453::$$$message_0348_0037_0000$$$::She coldly tells me like it's the final warning.::
40454::$$$message_0348_0038_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40455::$$$message_0348_0038_0001$$$::The heat that had cooled down returns.[lr]::
40456::$$$message_0348_0038_0002$$$::My thoughts get confused from the pain and heat.::
40457::$$$message_0348_0039_0000$$$::    I can't save Saber.[lr]::
40458::$$$message_0348_0039_0001$$$::    There's no reason for Shirou Emiya to fight.::
40459::$$$message_0348_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40460::$$$message_0348_0040_0001$$$::...My wound hurts.[lr]::
40461::$$$message_0348_0040_0002$$$::I repeat those words in my head as I look down at the night view that swallowed Tohsaka.::
