76078::$$$message_0703_0000_0000$$$::I go up the hill.[lr]::
76079::$$$message_0703_0000_0001$$$::There's no life in the town.[lr]::
76080::$$$message_0703_0000_0002$$$::It's still only eight or nine o'clock, but not only is there no one outside, the town doesn't even have the warmth of people living in it.::
76081::$$$message_0703_0001_0000$$$::"...Nrgh."[lr]::
76082::$$$message_0703_0001_0001$$$::I find myself leaning against a fence.[lr]::
76083::$$$message_0703_0001_0002$$$::My left arm is burning.[lr]::
76084::$$$message_0703_0001_0003$$$::Maybe I stopped being as tense once I was alone, but my left arm's been hurting since I started up the hill.::
76085::$$$message_0703_0002_0000$$$::"...I'm putting someone else's arm through a lot, so of course it would."[lr]::
76086::$$$message_0703_0002_0001$$$::...I'm having a hard time catching my breath.[lr]::
76087::$$$message_0703_0002_0002$$$::The heat spreads through my left arm with each step I take, its temperature slowly rising.[lr]::
76088::$$$message_0703_0002_0003$$$::Whenever it gets too far away from my normal body temperature, fresh pain stabs into my chest from the tip of my shoulder.::
76089::$$$message_0703_0003_0000$$$::"Ahh... It hurts on my end too, not just in the arm."[lr]::
76090::$$$message_0703_0003_0001$$$::I rest my back against the wall and take a deep breath.[lr]::
76091::$$$message_0703_0003_0002$$$::...I've more or less gotten used to how the pain works.[lr]::
76092::$$$message_0703_0003_0003$$$::It's like refrigeration.[lr]::
76093::$$$message_0703_0003_0004$$$::For whatever reason, my left arm becomes hot whenever I move.[lr]::
76094::$$$message_0703_0003_0005$$$::Once enough heat builds up in the arm, it gets dumped into my body.::
76095::$$$message_0703_0004_0000$$$::"Rrgh..."[lr]::
76096::$$$message_0703_0004_0001$$$::This pain comes from the heat burning my body.[lr]::
76097::$$$message_0703_0004_0002$$$::I have the acute sensation of something foreign being injected, and it feels more like being cut than heated.[lr]::
76098::$$$message_0703_0004_0003$$$::Every time the red vertigo comes, I feel a long blade stab me in the shoulder, and I almost think I hear grinding sounds inside my body.::
76099::$$$message_0703_0005_0000$$$::"Guh... Hah, hah... Ngh...!"[lr]::
76100::$$$message_0703_0005_0001$$$::To be honest, I'm not sure how much more I can take of this.[lr]::
76101::$$$message_0703_0005_0002$$$::Berserker's torn my stomach open before, and Rider's caved my rib cage in.[lr]::
76102::$$$message_0703_0005_0003$$$::Even though I've experienced damage like that before, the thought of my own arm "stabbing" my body gives me chills.::
76103::$$$message_0703_0006_0000$$$::"It's okay. Calm down... If I can stop my body temp from getting any worse, it should make this thing behave..."[lr]::
76104::$$$message_0703_0006_0001$$$::I look up at the night sky as I steady my breathing.[lr]::
76105::$$$message_0703_0006_0002$$$::It's already been twenty minutes since I parted ways with Tohsaka and Illya.[lr]::
76106::$$$message_0703_0006_0003$$$::Before, I would've gotten home by now, but I can't let Sakura see me this winded and sweaty.[lr]::
76107::$$$message_0703_0006_0004$$$::...I should keep my left arm's problems to myself.::
76108::$$$message_0703_0007_0000$$$::"...Damn that Kotomine. Go back to my normal life? I'm never getting used to this thing."[lr]::
76109::$$$message_0703_0007_0001$$$::I press my hand to my left shoulder, against the red cloth wrapping my arm.[lr]::
76110::$$$message_0703_0007_0002$$$::My left arm can't so much as twitch, and it's as hard as iron.::
76111::$$$message_0703_0008_0000$$$::...Okay.[lr]::
76112::$$$message_0703_0008_0001$$$::I'm not sweating anymore, and my breathing is regular.[lr]::
76113::$$$message_0703_0008_0002$$$::It's getting late, so I'd better look as peppy as I can and say hi to Sakura.::
76114::$$$message_0703_0009_0000$$$::"I'm home!"[lr]::
76115::$$$message_0703_0009_0001$$$::I take a deep breath, and announce myself loudly as I walk through the front door.[lr]::
76116::$$$message_0703_0009_0002$$$::"...Ah... Welcome home, Senpai."[lr]::
76117::$$$message_0703_0009_0003$$$::Sakura's already at the entrance, like she's been waiting here the whole time.::
76118::$$$message_0703_0010_0000$$$::"? Hey, why do you look so down? I'm glad you came to greet me, but it's hard to be happy when you're making a face like that."::
76119::$$$message_0703_0011_0000$$$::I take off my shoes and go into the corridor.[lr]::
76120::$$$message_0703_0011_0001$$$::For now, I want to rest my body.[lr]::
76121::$$$message_0703_0011_0002$$$::I'll go to the living room and have a cup of tea before I tell Sakura what happened today.::
76122::$$$message_0703_0012_0000$$$::"...Oh, I shouldn't do that. Better tell her what happened before I have tea."[lr]::
76123::$$$message_0703_0012_0001$$$::Tohsaka will be here soon.[lr]::
76124::$$$message_0703_0012_0002$$$::If I don't explain the situation first, Sakura will be on guard against Tohsaka.::
76125::$$$message_0703_0013_0000$$$::"About today, Sakura..."[lr]::
76126::$$$message_0703_0013_0001$$$::"...Senpai. You aren't going to say anything?"[lr]::
76127::$$$message_0703_0013_0002$$$::Before I can finish,[lr]::
76128::$$$message_0703_0013_0003$$$::Sakura asks me a faltering question.::
76129::$$$message_0703_0014_0000$$$::"Say what, exactly?"[lr]::
76130::$$$message_0703_0014_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
76131::$$$message_0703_0014_0002$$$::Sakura is silent.[lr]::
76132::$$$message_0703_0014_0003$$$::She's looking at my left arm.::
76133::$$$message_0703_0015_0000$$$::"Oh, this. Yeah, I'd be surprised if I were you, too."[lr]::
76134::$$$message_0703_0015_0001$$$::It's wrapped in thick cloths that are clearly more than just bandages.[lr]::
76135::$$$message_0703_0015_0002$$$::Sakura may not know what happened, but anyone would notice that.::
76136::$$$message_0703_0016_0000$$$::"Yeah, I got a little hurt. But I can move it just fine, so it's no big deal. This wrap is actually in the way, but Kotomine kept telling me not to take it off.[lr]::
76137::$$$message_0703_0016_0001$$$::He did give me medical treatment, so I figure I'll do what he says."::
76138::$$$message_0703_0017_0000$$$::I pat my left arm to show that I'm okay.[lr]::
76139::$$$message_0703_0017_0001$$$::...But that just makes Sakura get even more quiet.::
76140::$$$message_0703_0018_0000$$$::"Sakura...? Hey, I'm okay, really. It just looks bad, but it was just a scratch. It'll get better soon, so you don't need to worry[line2]"::
76141::$$$message_0703_0019_0000$$$::"Th-that isn't a scratch at all! It isn't even your own arm! How can you say that when you can't even move your fingers!?[lr]::
76142::$$$message_0703_0019_0001$$$::Even I won't be fooled by such obvious lies! Or are you not telling me because you don't trust me to understand!?"::
76143::$$$message_0703_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76144::$$$message_0703_0020_0001$$$::She lashes out with fiery anger.[lr]::
76145::$$$message_0703_0020_0002$$$::...I'm speechless at my own stupidity.[lr]::
76146::$$$message_0703_0020_0003$$$::I didn't consider what Sakura must have felt like staying at home by herself all day.::
76147::$$$message_0703_0021_0000$$$::"Sakura..."[lr]::
76148::$$$message_0703_0021_0001$$$::"Ah... I-I'm sorry. I don't mean to blame you for it. I just...want you to take better care of yourself, and, um..."::
76149::$$$message_0703_0022_0000$$$::No. You're right, but you're also wrong.[lr]::
76150::$$$message_0703_0022_0001$$$::I'm not upset because you yelled at me. Um, I'm surprised and sorry because this is the first time I've seen you sincerely angry."::
76151::$$$message_0703_0023_0000$$$::"You're... sorry?"[lr]::
76152::$$$message_0703_0023_0001$$$::"Yeah. I know I shouldn't bluff, especially in front of you. I think I just didn't want you to see me being lame, so I pretended I was okay.[lr]::
76153::$$$message_0703_0023_0002$$$::But doing that makes me look even worse. It's only normal that you'd be upset."::
76154::$$$message_0703_0024_0000$$$::"Oh... no, I've never once thought that you looked lame."[lr]::
76155::$$$message_0703_0024_0001$$$::No, I definitely am.[lr]::
76156::$$$message_0703_0024_0002$$$::...What was I thinking, hoping not to make her worry by telling her nothing at all?[lr]::
76157::$$$message_0703_0024_0003$$$::I was just trying to put on a strong front for Sakura.::
76158::$$$message_0703_0025_0000$$$::"Yeah. Sorry, Sakura. They got me good.[lr]::
76159::$$$message_0703_0025_0001$$$::My arm got fixed somehow, but I couldn't help you."::
76160::$$$message_0703_0026_0000$$$::"Ah... Th-that isn't true! You did great, Senpai! I w-wasn't watching or anything, but you looked really cool!"::
76161::$$$message_0703_0027_0000$$$::"Oof... I really was pathetic back there, so it hurts to hear that. I couldn't help Illya as much as I wanted. All I could do was run away."::
76162::$$$message_0703_0028_0000$$$::"...But you still came home to me. I'm so happy that you kept your promise."::
76163::$$$message_0703_0029_0000$$$::"Oh... Yeah. Me too."[lr]::
76164::$$$message_0703_0029_0001$$$::I scratch my head bashfully.[lr]::
76165::$$$message_0703_0029_0002$$$::Still, though...[lr]::
76166::$$$message_0703_0029_0003$$$::I'm both happy and embarrassed to have her say that to me.::
76167::$$$message_0703_0030_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I survived. That's enough, right?"[lr]::
76168::$$$message_0703_0030_0001$$$::"Yes. You're very dashing. I've fallen for you all over again."::
76169::$$$message_0703_0031_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
76170::$$$message_0703_0031_0001$$$::Sakura seems to have cheered up incredibly, because she gives me a sunny grin.::
76171::$$$message_0703_0032_0000$$$::"Ah... erm."[lr]::
76172::$$$message_0703_0032_0001$$$::I don't know what exactly to say to that, so I just...[lr]::
76173::$$$message_0703_0032_0002$$$::"Um, what am I supposed to say now, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
76174::$$$message_0703_0032_0003$$$::"Who knows? But if you want my opinion, I wish you two wouldn't flirt so much in the doorway."[lr]::
76175::$$$message_0703_0032_0004$$$::I turn to Tohsaka, who's right behind me.::
76176::$$$message_0703_0033_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
76177::$$$message_0703_0033_0001$$$::Our surprised voices harmonize.[lr]::
76178::$$$message_0703_0033_0002$$$::Sakura and I take a surprised half step back.[lr]::
76179::$$$message_0703_0033_0003$$$::"H-how long have you been there, Tohsaka!?"[lr]::
76180::$$$message_0703_0033_0004$$$::"Tohsaka-senpai, what are you doing at our house!?"[lr]::
76181::$$$message_0703_0033_0005$$$::And we exclaim our shock in unison, too.::
76182::$$$message_0703_0034_0000$$$::"Don't give me that. Just when I thought you were filling her in, I catch you two having a friendly spat. Do you even understand how urgent things are right now, Shirou?"::
76183::$$$message_0703_0035_0000$$$::Tohsaka sets a large overnight bag down on the entrance floor.[lr]::
76184::$$$message_0703_0035_0001$$$::Behind her,[lr]::
76185::$$$message_0703_0035_0002$$$::I see Illya standing silently, looking very tense.::
76186::$$$message_0703_0036_0000$$$::"T-Tohsaka-senpai. I don't mind if you want to continue things from last night.[lr]::
76187::$$$message_0703_0036_0001$$$::Since Senpai is protecting me, I'll fight you with everything I have as the Matou mage."::
76188::$$$message_0703_0037_0000$$$::Sakura balls her hands into fists and enters a staring match with Tohsaka.[lr]::
76189::$$$message_0703_0037_0001$$$::...No, it's more like a frog desperately standing up to a snake that's spotted its prey.::
76190::$$$message_0703_0038_0000$$$::"...Haah. Looks like he still hasn't told you.[lr]::
76191::$$$message_0703_0038_0001$$$::Okay, Sakura. We're tabling your disposal for the time being. My first priority is to defeat Zouken. I can settle things with you later... Though, once we beat Zouken, I won't need to fight you anymore, so hopefully it'll work out that way."::
76192::$$$message_0703_0039_0000$$$::"Huh? Then, you're..."::
76193::$$$message_0703_0040_0000$$$::I'm helping you[line2]no, Shirou to defeat Zouken. But it would waste a lot of time if I lived far away, right? So, I'm going to start living here from tonight, and I'll train him, too. It's going to take some spartan training to get him into fighting shape.::
76194::$$$message_0703_0041_0000$$$::"On that note, I'll be borrowing Shirou for a while. It's going to be a rough treatment, but I'm sure you both won't mind."[lr]::
76195::$$$message_0703_0041_0001$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
76196::$$$message_0703_0041_0002$$$::Rin Tohsaka starts laying out my schedule without any input from me.::
76197::$$$message_0703_0042_0000$$$::"W-wait, Tohsaka. This is too sudden[line2]"::
76198::$$$message_0703_0043_0000$$$::"Y-you can't do that![lr]::
76199::$$$message_0703_0043_0001$$$::Who gave you the right to decide that, Nee[line2]I mean, Tohsaka-senpai!?"[lr]::
76200::$$$message_0703_0043_0002$$$::"...I need time to mentally prepare myself, y'know?"::
76201::$$$message_0703_0044_0000$$$::I meekly protest.[lr]::
76202::$$$message_0703_0044_0001$$$::Of course, my opinion is completely rejected by Sakura's outcry and Tohsaka's stern glance.::
76203::$$$message_0703_0045_0000$$$::"Oh, so all I need is the right to decide? I have that, too. He's only alive thanks to me.[lr]::
76204::$$$message_0703_0045_0001$$$::Until Shirou repays that debt, he has to do what I say. If I order him to surrender his home or cook me three meals a day, he'll gladly comply, won't he?"[lr]::
76205::$$$message_0703_0045_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76206::$$$message_0703_0045_0003$$$::Tohsaka. People are bound to get the wrong idea when you say it that way.::
76207::$$$message_0703_0046_0000$$$::"It can't be... I-is that true, Senpai?"[lr]::
76208::$$$message_0703_0046_0001$$$::"...Yeah. I'm not happy about the way she makes it sound, but what she's saying is true."::
76209::$$$message_0703_0047_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76210::$$$message_0703_0047_0001$$$::"Plus, it's better to have more allies. Zouken is definitely after you right now. If Tohsaka's with us, then I can protect you."[lr]::
76211::$$$message_0703_0047_0002$$$::Besides, Tohsaka's her big sister.[lr]::
76212::$$$message_0703_0047_0003$$$::I'd prefer it if they were together, and I don't want them to fight.::
76213::$$$message_0703_0048_0000$$$::"...I understand. If that's what you've decided, I'll go along with it."[lr]::
76214::$$$message_0703_0048_0001$$$::Sakura looks away.:㮔
