36202::$$$message_0302_0000_0000$$$::...I walk through the darkening town.[lr]::
36203::$$$message_0302_0000_0001$$$::It's not yet 7 PM, so there are still people around.[lr]::
36204::$$$message_0302_0000_0002$$$::I don't think an escort is necessary, but I have no reason to turn down her goodwill. ::
36205::$$$message_0302_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36206::$$$message_0302_0001_0001$$$::But maybe I should've declined.[lr]::
36207::$$$message_0302_0001_0002$$$::I feel on edge.[lr]::
36208::$$$message_0302_0001_0003$$$::The goose bumps on my skin are going crazy and I feel like I'll hurl from the tension.::
36209::$$$message_0302_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36210::$$$message_0302_0002_0001$$$::I feel hostility piercing my back.[lr]::
36211::$$$message_0302_0002_0002$$$::The invisible guard is the most cautious of me, the person he's supposed to be protecting.[lr]::
36212::$$$message_0302_0002_0003$$$::...What the hell kind of protection is this?[lr]::
36213::$$$message_0302_0002_0004$$$::This sensation is being caused by him. My very nerves are being worn out by this guy behind me.::
36214::$$$message_0302_0003_0000$$$::"Around here is fine. Things might end up like last time if you get any closer."[lr]::
36215::$$$message_0302_0003_0001$$$::I tell the presence behind me.[lr]::
36216::$$$message_0302_0003_0002$$$::Archer doesn't answer.[lr]::
36217::$$$message_0302_0003_0003$$$::He just accepts my complaint and tries to leave.::
36218::$$$message_0302_0004_0000$$$::"...Hold on. Don't you have something you want to say?"[lr]::
36219::$$$message_0302_0004_0001$$$::I glare at the invisible guy.[lr]::
36220::$$$message_0302_0004_0002$$$::The presence trying to leave stops.[lr]::
36221::$$$message_0302_0004_0003$$$::He takes form, with his hostility still present.::
36222::$$$message_0302_0005_0000$$$::"I have a better opinion of you now. It seems like you at least have the ability to feel hostility. Wow, I thought you were a pacifist who wouldn't even kill a bug."::
36223::$$$message_0302_0006_0000$$$::"...Don't mock me. I'm still a mage. If my enemy wants to fight, I'll fight."[lr]::
36224::$$$message_0302_0006_0001$$$::I confront the knight in red with all my might so that I don't get overpowered.[lr]::
36225::$$$message_0302_0006_0002$$$::He gives me a mocking smirk and shrugs.::
36226::$$$message_0302_0007_0000$$$::"Don't talk nonsense. A mage that does not smell like blood is a half-ass.[lr]::
36227::$$$message_0302_0007_0001$$$::Didn't you learn so from your mentor, Shirou Emiya?"[lr]::
36228::$$$message_0302_0007_0002$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
36229::$$$message_0302_0007_0003$$$::My spirit weakens.[lr]::
36230::$$$message_0302_0007_0004$$$::...Yeah, Kiritsugu certainly said so.::
36231::$$$message_0302_0008_0000$$$::Mages are stained with blood.[lr]::
36232::$$$message_0302_0008_0001$$$::It doesn't matter whether you hurt others or not. Even if you don't do it yourself, the path moving forward is paved with blood.[lr]::
36233::$$$message_0302_0008_0002$$$::That's why...Kiritsugu said not to become a mage.::
36234::$$$message_0302_0009_0000$$$::"...Are you saying you don't smell blood on me?"[lr]::
36235::$$$message_0302_0009_0001$$$::"Of course not. You're not fit to be a Master in that regard either. You are way different from Rin."[lr]::
36236::$$$message_0302_0009_0002$$$::"...What do you mean? Are you saying that you can smell blood on Tohsaka?"::
36237::$$$message_0302_0010_0000$$$::"Yes. She's a bit too nice, but she's merciless when she has to be. She wouldn't be going around looking for Masters everyday if that wasn't the case."::
36238::$$$message_0302_0011_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
36239::$$$message_0302_0011_0001$$$::Looking around for Masters everyday...?[lr]::
36240::$$$message_0302_0011_0002$$$::That means she's fighting other Masters.[lr]::
36241::$$$message_0302_0011_0003$$$::It's not like she's done once she finds them.[lr]::
36242::$$$message_0302_0011_0004$$$::Then...::
36243::$$$message_0302_0012_0000$$$::"...So, Tohsaka is doing stuff like what happened today all the time?"[lr]::
36244::$$$message_0302_0012_0001$$$::The incident at school.[lr]::
36245::$$$message_0302_0012_0002$$$::The same thing as what happened in the woods...?::
36246::$$$message_0302_0013_0000$$$::"Of course not. I would hope that something like this wouldn't happen again. It seems that even a mage with that much willpower and ability goes back to acting her age when she's facing you."::
36247::$$$message_0302_0014_0000$$$::"First of all, she does not need to cooperate with you with the skills she has.[lr]::
36248::$$$message_0302_0014_0001$$$::Yet she still does meaningless things. I am against this cooperation but... Well, hell if I can do anything about it. Servants obey their Master."::
36249::$$$message_0302_0015_0000$$$::"Isn't that right, Shirou Emiya? Even if the Master is a useless amateur, the Servant must obey them."[lr]::
36250::$$$message_0302_0015_0001$$$::...He's...[lr]::
36251::$$$message_0302_0015_0002$$$::I'd swear he's talking about me and Saber.::
36252::$$$message_0302_0016_0000$$$::"...I see. I feel bad for Tohsaka, having to partner with such a cynical guy."::
36253::$$$message_0302_0017_0000$$$::"...I'm amazed. You still say such nonsense.[lr]::
36254::$$$message_0302_0017_0001$$$::Here's some advice: Do not worry about the personalities of Servants. We are summoned to fight. Servants are only tools bound by Command Spells. You guys have total control over us, so ignore whatever nonsense the tools have to say." ::
36255::$$$message_0302_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36256::$$$message_0302_0018_0001$$$::I can't tell him that that's not the case.[lr]::
36257::$$$message_0302_0018_0002$$$::What Archer, who is bound as such, said is the truth.[lr]::
36258::$$$message_0302_0018_0003$$$::...I can't think of Saber as a tool, but it is true that Saber is bound by the Command Spells.::
36259::$$$message_0302_0019_0000$$$::"So, why did you stop me? There's no way it's something stupid like trying to be friendly."[lr]::
36260::$$$message_0302_0019_0001$$$::"Grr...!"[lr]::
36261::$$$message_0302_0019_0002$$$::...Ugh.[lr]::
36262::$$$message_0302_0019_0003$$$::There's no reason.[lr]::
36263::$$$message_0302_0019_0004$$$::I just don't like him, so I needed to complain.::
36264::$$$message_0302_0020_0000$$$::"Uh... Oh yeah. Archer, do you want the Holy Grail, too?"[lr]::
36265::$$$message_0302_0020_0001$$$::I ask an obvious question in desperation.[lr]::
36266::$$$message_0302_0020_0002$$$::    Then...::
36267::$$$message_0302_0021_0000$$$::"The Holy Grail...? Oh, that awful treasure chest that grants wishes, huh? I'm not interested. My wish cannot be granted by such a thing."[lr]::
36268::$$$message_0302_0021_0001$$$::The knight in red so declares, his disdain obvious.::
36269::$$$message_0302_0022_0000$$$::"...What...?"[lr]::
36270::$$$message_0302_0022_0001$$$::That's contradictory.[lr]::
36271::$$$message_0302_0022_0002$$$::Servants desire the Holy Grail.[lr]::
36272::$$$message_0302_0022_0003$$$::Isn't that why they answer the call of their mage and become a Servant...?::
36273::$$$message_0302_0023_0000$$$::"Wait, that's messed up. Why else would you become a Servant?"[lr]::
36274::$$$message_0302_0023_0001$$$::"Over the course of events, I had no other choice.[lr]::
36275::$$$message_0302_0023_0002$$$::I do not have free will. Do you think that Servants answer the call by their own will?"::
36276::$$$message_0302_0024_0000$$$::"What...?"[lr]::
36277::$$$message_0302_0024_0001$$$::Don't have free will...?[lr]::
36278::$$$message_0302_0024_0002$$$::Does that mean that he was called against his will even though he's not interested in the Holy Grail...?::
36279::$$$message_0302_0025_0000$$$::"I'm in the presence of a real genius here. Have you never thought about it?[lr]::
36280::$$$message_0302_0025_0001$$$::Get it? [font italic=true]Servants are the ones being called[font italic=false], not the other way around.[lr]::
36281::$$$message_0302_0025_0002$$$::They don't get a say in the matter. Heroic Spirits respond to another's will. They aren't the ones reaching out.[lr]::
36282::$$$message_0302_0025_0003$$$::We became Heroic Spirits because of past achievements, our legend is passed down through the generations, and we become support for people in the future." ::
36283::$$$message_0302_0026_0000$$$::"...But, do you think that Heroic Spirits would really wish from the bottom of their heart to just be of help to humans?"[lr]::
36284::$$$message_0302_0026_0001$$$::"...Well..."[lr]::
36285::$$$message_0302_0026_0002$$$::...I don't know.[lr]::
36286::$$$message_0302_0026_0003$$$::If they are called Heroic Spirits, they must be noble to some degree.[lr]::
36287::$$$message_0302_0026_0004$$$::That's why I have the impression of them protecting people, but that's not the case for many of the Servants that I've encountered.::
36288::$$$message_0302_0027_0000$$$::"That's right. Heroic Spirits do not have any will to start with.[lr]::
36289::$$$message_0302_0027_0001$$$::Heroic Spirits are there just to help protect people."::
36290::$$$message_0302_0028_0000$$$::"We are only summoned when there is some inconvenience, and we disappear after everything is settled.[lr]::
36291::$$$message_0302_0028_0001$$$::We exist, but don't really exist. We save humanity but ultimately go unrecognized.[lr]::
36292::$$$message_0302_0028_0002$$$::We're just a convenient guardian.[lr]::
36293::$$$message_0302_0028_0003$$$::It is all over once we become one. Our will is stripped away, and we become nothing more than a cleanup crew for humans thereafter."::
36294::$$$message_0302_0029_0000$$$::"What..."[lr]::
36295::$$$message_0302_0029_0001$$$::Summoned only to disappear.[lr]::
36296::$$$message_0302_0029_0002$$$::Heroic Spirits are tools without a will?::
36297::$$$message_0302_0030_0000$$$::"That can't be true. You and Saber both have your own will...Well you might've been summoned against your will, but don't you have a choice after you've been summoned?[lr]::
36298::$$$message_0302_0030_0001$$$::Like how Saber turns down things that she doesn't want to do."::
36299::$$$message_0302_0031_0000$$$::"Of course, we are Servants. I don't know who made this system, but this war is well made.[lr]::
36300::$$$message_0302_0031_0001$$$::It gives what ought to just be a fractional part of the Heroic Spirit a full form, and allows that to act as the completed being.[lr]::
36301::$$$message_0302_0031_0002$$$::The moment Heroic Spirits are given bodies, they can regain their humanity. Along with the desires and regrets they once had." ::
36302::$$$message_0302_0032_0000$$$::"That is why Servants seek the Holy Grail.[lr]::
36303::$$$message_0302_0032_0001$$$::We should be able to clear our regrets with the Holy Grail, and it will let us stay in this world as humans, even if it may be for a short while."::
36304::$$$message_0302_0033_0000$$$::"Stay here as humans..."[lr]::
36305::$$$message_0302_0033_0001$$$::That must mean that they can be free as an individual and not as a Servant.::
36306::$$$message_0302_0034_0000$$$::...In addition, the Holy Grail has the power to grant wishes.[lr]::
36307::$$$message_0302_0034_0001$$$::If it means that they can grant the wishes they had before they died, then it makes sense for Servants to cooperate with their Masters.[lr]::
36308::$$$message_0302_0034_0002$$$::So the Holy Grail is a miracle that came out of nowhere to the Heroic Spirits as well.::
36309::$$$message_0302_0035_0000$$$::"...Then why? You said you don't need something like the grail, but you can fulfill a wish that couldn't come true, and you can quit being a Servant."::
36310::$$$message_0302_0036_0000$$$::"...It's simple.[lr]::
36311::$$$message_0302_0036_0001$$$::I have no wishes that couldn't come true."::
36312::$$$message_0302_0037_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
36313::$$$message_0302_0037_0001$$$::"I'm different from the others. I fulfilled my desire, died, and became a Heroic Spirit.[lr]::
36314::$$$message_0302_0037_0002$$$::That's why I don't have any desires that I wish to fulfill, nor am I interested in staying here as a human. That must be the same for your Servant."::
36315::$$$message_0302_0038_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]Don't be stupid. Saber said she needed the Holy Grail. She's not like you, a Servant with no objective."::
36316::$$$message_0302_0039_0000$$$::"...Like me...objective?"[lr]::
36317::$$$message_0302_0039_0001$$$::Archer murmurs, stunned.[lr]::
36318::$$$message_0302_0039_0002$$$::"Khh...!"[lr]::
36319::$$$message_0302_0039_0003$$$::I wonder why.[lr]::
36320::$$$message_0302_0039_0004$$$::He was just muttering to himself, but I felt a chill.::
36321::$$$message_0302_0040_0000$$$::"...Heh. It's the same whether you have an objective or not.[lr]::
36322::$$$message_0302_0040_0001$$$::Ask your Servant if you're curious. While Saber's objective is the Holy Grail, she would never use it for herself. In that regard, she is ideal as a guardian. A literal slave.[lr]::
36323::$$$message_0302_0040_0002$$$::If you are to be her Master,[lr]::
36324::$$$message_0302_0040_0003$$$::you must never forget what I've just said."::
36325::$$$message_0302_0041_0000$$$::His presence disappears.[lr]::
36326::$$$message_0302_0041_0001$$$::The knight in red hurls spiteful remarks until the very end as he leaves.::
