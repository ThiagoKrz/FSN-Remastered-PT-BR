7127::$$$message_0067_0000_0000$$$::"Sa...ber..."[lr]::
7128::$$$message_0067_0000_0001$$$::I call for help.[lr]::
7129::$$$message_0067_0000_0002$$$::Hanging between earth and sky, my thoughts swirl as time seems to slow...and I wish upon my Command Spell.::
7130::$$$message_0067_0001_0000$$$::   One second before impact...[lr]::
7131::$$$message_0067_0001_0001$$$::Logically, there's no chance of me surviving this, but I still hope Saber can defy that simple reality.[lr]::
7132::$$$message_0067_0001_0002$$$::"Please...come to me, Saber!!!"[lr]::
7133::$$$message_0067_0001_0003$$$::I muster up all my strength and call for my blade.[lr]::
7134::$$$message_0067_0001_0004$$$::One of my Command Spell strokes disappears.[lr]::
7135::$$$message_0067_0001_0005$$$::At that very moment, the space around me begins to waver.::
7136::$$$message_0067_0002_0000$$$::So [font italic=true]this[font italic=false] is magic.[lr]::
7137::$$$message_0067_0002_0001$$$::Saber, clad in her silver armor, bursts through the ripples in space and time to appear before me.::
7138::$$$message_0067_0003_0000$$$::"Master!?"[lr]::
7139::$$$message_0067_0003_0001$$$::The girl in the silver armor rushes toward me.[lr]::
7140::$$$message_0067_0003_0002$$$::Saber suddenly appears in the schoolyard and before she can assess the situation, she recognizes me falling at full speed.[lr]::
7141::$$$message_0067_0003_0003$$$::"N...fuh...!"[lr]::
7142::$$$message_0067_0003_0004$$$::She catches me right before I slam down to the ground.::
7143::$$$message_0067_0004_0000$$$::"Ar...gh...thanks, Saber. You saved...me."[lr]::
7144::$$$message_0067_0004_0001$$$::I'm still bloody, but I manage to stand on ground.[lr]::
7145::$$$message_0067_0004_0002$$$::I may have avoided getting slammed to the ground, but my body that's been slashed numerous times is already past its limit.::
7146::$$$message_0067_0005_0000$$$::"Ha...ah...gh!"[lr]::
7147::$$$message_0067_0005_0001$$$::But there's no time staying down.[lr]::
7148::$$$message_0067_0005_0002$$$::Forcing my numb limbs to move, I push to my feet to show her that I'm all right.::
7149::$$$message_0067_0006_0000$$$::"There's no time to explain. You understand what's happening, right, Saber?"[lr]::
7150::$$$message_0067_0006_0001$$$::"Please wait, Shirou. I do understand, but first, your body must[line2]"[lr]::
7151::$$$message_0067_0006_0002$$$::"Take care of Rider. Only you can beat her."::
7152::$$$message_0067_0007_0000$$$::"I cannot. Treating you is my first priority. You will not survive these wounds."[lr]::
7153::$$$message_0067_0007_0001$$$::"No. There's something else that needs doing first."[lr]::
7154::$$$message_0067_0007_0002$$$::We need to beat Shinji and Rider. As quickly as possible.[lr]::
7155::$$$message_0067_0007_0003$$$::Nothing is more important.::
7156::$$$message_0067_0008_0000$$$::"But if I do that..."[lr]::
7157::$$$message_0067_0008_0001$$$::Saber is focused only on me.[lr]::
7158::$$$message_0067_0008_0002$$$::I'd be lying if I said I wasn't happy about that.[lr]::
7159::$$$message_0067_0008_0003$$$::But there's no time to argue.[lr]::
7160::$$$message_0067_0008_0004$$$::If Saber doesn't want to listen, I just need to use my second Command Spell.::
7161::$$$message_0067_0009_0000$$$::"...Hn."[lr]::
7162::$$$message_0067_0009_0001$$$::She must have understood my resolve.[lr]::
7163::$$$message_0067_0009_0002$$$::Saber reluctantly accepts my decision.::
7164::$$$message_0067_0010_0000$$$::"Understood. Master, your orders."[lr]::
7165::$$$message_0067_0010_0001$$$::"Defeat Rider. I'll handle Shinji."[lr]::
7166::$$$message_0067_0010_0002$$$::Saber does not hesitate.[lr]::
7167::$$$message_0067_0010_0003$$$::She nods and, without another word, turns toward the school building like a whirlwind.[lr]ìfNO
