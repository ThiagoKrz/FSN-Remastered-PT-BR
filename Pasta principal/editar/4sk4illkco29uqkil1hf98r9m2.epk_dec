71499::$$$message_0658_0002_0003$$$::I don't breathe when I lose focus, so I brace myself for knives to stab my throat, and finally manage to breathe a few times.[lr]::
71500::$$$message_0658_0002_0004$$$::I try that hard to breathe because humans can't move without sufficient oxygen.[lr]::
71501::$$$message_0658_0002_0005$$$::But right now, maybe I can move without any oxygen, and even if I breathed in a lot, it won't be long before I[line2]::

71504::$$$message_0658_0003_0002$$$::Hundreds of blades are sprouting from my body.[lr]::
71505::$$$message_0658_0003_0003$$$::It's an execution I can't escape from.[lr]::

71507::$$$message_0658_0003_0005$$$::But I've always known that.::
71508::$$$message_0658_0004_0000$$$::[line8]told me.[lr]::
71509::$$$message_0658_0004_0001$$$::He said that if I used Projection, it would light the fuse on a time bomb.[lr]::
71510::$$$message_0658_0004_0002$$$::So, this ending was set a long time ago.::

71515::$$$message_0658_0005_0004$$$::But just a little more.[lr]::
71516::$$$message_0658_0005_0005$$$::Everything will be over once I erase that thing.[lr]::

71521::$$$message_0658_0007_0001$$$::The shadows flicker.[lr]::

71527::$$$message_0658_0008_0003$$$::In this lifeless world, he blocks my way like it's his destiny.::

71529::$$$message_0658_0009_0001$$$::It's way too late for you to be showing up."[lr]::
71530::$$$message_0658_0009_0002$$$::I don't ask him why he's alive.[lr]::
71531::$$$message_0658_0009_0003$$$::He's a walking corpse.[lr]::
71532::$$$message_0658_0009_0004$$$::I don't feel any magical energy emanating from his body.[lr]::
71533::$$$message_0658_0009_0005$$$::There's a dark stain where his heart should be.[lr]::
71534::$$$message_0658_0009_0006$$$::   He's a short flame like a flipped hourglass, the same as me.::
71535::$$$message_0658_0010_0000$$$::I can't hear Kotomine's heartbeat.[lr]::
71536::$$$message_0658_0010_0001$$$::He doesn't have much time left.[lr]::
71537::$$$message_0658_0010_0002$$$::That isn't speculation. It's a fact.[lr]::
71538::$$$message_0658_0010_0003$$$::Kirei Kotomine will die in minutes, no matter what.::
71539::$$$message_0658_0011_0000$$$::"You already know the answer to that.[lr]::
71540::$$$message_0658_0011_0001$$$::I only have one goal: to see this curse be born."[lr]::
71541::$$$message_0658_0011_0002$$$::"What? You can't do that. It doesn't belong to you."::
71542::$$$message_0658_0012_0000$$$::"Of course. I can't interfere with it, nor do I intend to.[lr]::
71543::$$$message_0658_0012_0001$$$::But I believe I told you that I will bless its birth.[lr]::
71544::$$$message_0658_0012_0002$$$::It is most surely trying to be born now. It's only natural that I try to protect that birth from any who would threaten it."::
71545::$$$message_0658_0013_0000$$$::"...Are you insane, Kotomine? What can you possibly do when you're a dead man walking? Even if it got out like you want, you won't[line2]"::
71546::$$$message_0658_0014_0000$$$::"That goes for you as well. I've long since lost my sanity. We will share the same fate once I accomplish my goal.[lr]::
71547::$$$message_0658_0014_0001$$$::You will destroy this, and I will protect it.[lr]::
71548::$$$message_0658_0014_0002$$$::But no matter who succeeds, no one will be left to reap the benefits. You knew that when you came here.[lr]::
71549::$$$message_0658_0014_0003$$$::   This is a pointless conflict. In doing this, neither you nor I are sane."::

71553::$$$message_0658_0015_0003$$$::I need time to do it.[lr]::
71554::$$$message_0658_0015_0004$$$::If I give him an opening, he'll pulverize my brain before I can use Saber's sword.::
71555::$$$message_0658_0016_0000$$$::"...Why? Why are you trying so hard to protect it?[lr]::
71556::$$$message_0658_0016_0001$$$::You're not going to get anything out of it being born. So why?"[lr]::
71557::$$$message_0658_0016_0002$$$::Why would he approve of an enemy of humanity called "All the Evil in the World,"[lr]::
71558::$$$message_0658_0016_0003$$$::even on death's door?::
71559::$$$message_0658_0017_0000$$$::"The reason is very obvious: because this is the only thing which gives me joy.[lr]::

71561::$$$message_0658_0017_0002$$$::Just as you feel bliss when you see others' good fortune,[lr]::
71562::$$$message_0658_0017_0003$$$::I derive bliss from others' misfortune."::

71564::$$$message_0658_0018_0001$$$::"And why kill it? Is it not arrogant to judge it as evil before it is even born? Is it not love to help birth something which wants to be born?"::
71565::$$$message_0658_0019_0000$$$::"What 'love' is that? Stop talking in sophistries. That thing's killed a lot of people. I can't let it leave this place."[lr]::
71566::$$$message_0658_0019_0001$$$::"Oh? Then let me ask you this. What is the good and evil you speak of? Would you say that killing people is absolutely evil?"::
71567::$$$message_0658_0020_0000$$$::"I..."[lr]::
71568::$$$message_0658_0020_0001$$$::I can't possibly answer that.[lr]::
71569::$$$message_0658_0020_0002$$$::Right now, I have no morality.[lr]::
71570::$$$message_0658_0020_0003$$$::The moment I decided to save Sakura, I lost the justice that Shirou Emiya believed in.::
71571::$$$message_0658_0021_0000$$$::"That is fine. There was never an answer to my question. That is what it means to be human. The answers are never clear, and we accept changing truths. We have never known anything to be true from the beginning.[lr]::
71572::$$$message_0658_0021_0001$$$::Humans possess both good and evil, and how one distinguishes them is a personal choice. I believe I told you that we begin from zero, and that we are born without sin."::
71573::$$$message_0658_0022_0000$$$::"Yeah. You said that a baby can't commit sins even if it's evil."[lr]::
71574::$$$message_0658_0022_0001$$$::"That's right. Humans are born and tend toward good or evil depending on what we learn.[lr]::
71575::$$$message_0658_0022_0002$$$::A certain holy book asserts that humans are greater beings than angels. Why? Because there are people who know evil, but do not commit it.[lr]::
71576::$$$message_0658_0022_0003$$$::We are different from the angels who only know good from their birth.[lr]::
71577::$$$message_0658_0022_0004$$$::It states that humans are superior to angels because we are beings which can live good lives while possessing evil, unlike angels which only know good."::
71578::$$$message_0658_0022_0005$$$::"...Indeed,[lr]::
71579::$$$message_0658_0022_0006$$$::a heinous villain may show goodwill as a joke,[lr]::

71581::$$$message_0658_0022_0008$$$::That contradiction, that coexistence of good and evil is a Holy Grail which makes people human.[lr]::
71582::$$$message_0658_0022_0009$$$::Living is a sin, and punishment exists because people live. Good only exists because of life, as does evil.[lr]::
71583::$$$message_0658_0022_0010$$$::Therefore..."::
71584::$$$message_0658_0022_0011$$$::"One cannot question the crimes of something yet to be born.[lr]::
71585::$$$message_0658_0022_0012$$$::There is no one who wishes for nothing from anyone, and no one who is born evil.[lr]::
71586::$$$message_0658_0022_0013$$$::There is no reason that thing should be punished as soon as it is born."::
71587::$$$message_0658_0023_0000$$$::That's the answer of the priest named Kotomine.[lr]::
71588::$$$message_0658_0023_0001$$$::It's why he sincerely intends to forgive "all the evil" that people wished into existence.::
71589::$$$message_0658_0024_0000$$$::"...That's why you'll forgive it? This thing's always been meant to kill people. You know a lot of people will die if it gets out, so it's undoubtedly evil to us!"::
71590::$$$message_0658_0025_0000$$$::"Yes. Its very existence is evil. It was created to be thus. It was born evil.[lr]::
71591::$$$message_0658_0025_0001$$$::It is not like humans. It is a pure, simple god which only possesses evil, created by the people.[lr]::

71593::$$$message_0658_0026_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
71594::$$$message_0658_0026_0001$$$::He wants to know what Aŋra Mainiiu [font italic=true]personally[font italic=false] thinks?::
71595::$$$message_0658_0027_0000$$$::"Yes.[lr]::
71596::$$$message_0658_0027_0001$$$::Will Aŋra Mainiiu bemoan its own actions as evil, or laugh that they are good? We cannot possibly know this.[lr]::
71597::$$$message_0658_0027_0002$$$::If it has a human-like will and laments its own existence, that would make it evil.[lr]::
71598::$$$message_0658_0027_0003$$$::But if it has no doubts whatsoever about its own existence, it would be good. After all, that is what was wished of it. Something which does not question its own existence cannot possibly be evil."::
71599::$$$message_0658_0028_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
71600::$$$message_0658_0028_0001$$$::"Yes.[lr]::
71601::$$$message_0658_0028_0002$$$::It is something which was born with nothing.[lr]::
71602::$$$message_0658_0028_0003$$$::Something which was never desired by this world.[lr]::
71603::$$$message_0658_0028_0004$$$::It will show us the meaning of its birth and the value of something worthless."::
71604::$$$message_0658_0029_0000$$$::"Once it loses everything, breaks everything, and is all alone, will it forgive itself?[lr]::
71605::$$$message_0658_0029_0001$$$::I want to know.[lr]::
71606::$$$message_0658_0029_0002$$$::I wish to ask it if something estranged from the rest of the world which lives only as itself can be guilty of crimes.[lr]::
71607::$$$message_0658_0029_0003$$$::That is why I killed your father and prolonged Sakura Matou's life. I cannot provide the answer, so I wished for the birth of something which can."::
71608::$$$message_0658_0030_0000$$$::"That is my objective, Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
71609::$$$message_0658_0030_0001$$$::It is a wish of the same nature, yet the antithesis to you, who has no wish to return to yourself.::
71610::$$$message_0658_0031_0000$$$::"......"[lr]::
71611::$$$message_0658_0031_0001$$$::...I can't understand.[lr]::
71612::$$$message_0658_0031_0002$$$::This man's wish is too distant from me.[lr]::
71613::$$$message_0658_0031_0003$$$::...But I do understand one thing.[lr]::
71614::$$$message_0658_0031_0004$$$::He used Sakura for a wish like that.::
71615::$$$message_0658_0032_0000$$$::"Sakura. You used Sakura for all that?"[lr]::
71616::$$$message_0658_0032_0001$$$::I refocus my hazy vision and glare at the priest with all the hostility I can muster.::
71617::$$$message_0658_0033_0000$$$::This man...[lr]::
71618::$$$message_0658_0033_0001$$$::"Yes. I have killed many for that cause. So I cannot back down now.[lr]::
71619::$$$message_0658_0033_0002$$$::I told you, that is how I have lived.[lr]::
71620::$$$message_0658_0033_0003$$$::I am here to answer this riddle.[lr]::

71624::$$$message_0658_0034_0001$$$::He says it so brazenly.[lr]::
71625::$$$message_0658_0034_0002$$$::He talks like he has no regrets or mistakes.::
71626::$$$message_0658_0035_0000$$$::"......Yeah. I see."[lr]::
71627::$$$message_0658_0035_0001$$$::I understand now.[lr]::
71628::$$$message_0658_0035_0002$$$::I can never agree with this man. When I first met him, I reflexively wondered if I could ever accept him.[lr]::
71629::$$$message_0658_0035_0003$$$::And now, I know exactly why.::
71630::$$$message_0658_0036_0000$$$::I don't want to admit it.[lr]::
71631::$$$message_0658_0036_0001$$$::But I think I liked Kirei Kotomine.[lr]::
71632::$$$message_0658_0036_0002$$$::I desperately viewed him with hostility in an attempt to deny that, to pretend I didn't feel that way.::
71633::$$$message_0658_0037_0000$$$::He said that we were similar.[lr]::
71634::$$$message_0658_0037_0001$$$::I understand why now.[lr]::
71635::$$$message_0658_0037_0002$$$::We both think of ourselves as sinners.[lr]::
71636::$$$message_0658_0037_0003$$$::We both lived our lives trying to cast off those chains.[lr]::
71637::$$$message_0658_0037_0004$$$::   We knew our methods were flawed, but we believed it was the right way to atone, and we sought salvation we would never obtain.::
71638::$$$message_0658_0038_0000$$$::"...So you're not going to back off."[lr]::
71639::$$$message_0658_0038_0001$$$::He won't, because we're the same.[lr]::
71640::$$$message_0658_0038_0002$$$::It isn't because he's about to die and wants to see his wish come true.::
71641::$$$message_0658_0039_0000$$$::...That's right. He's not keeping an oath because this is the end.[lr]::
71642::$$$message_0658_0039_0001$$$::That's just how he's lived his life.[lr]::
71643::$$$message_0658_0039_0002$$$::He's never walked any other path.[lr]::
71644::$$$message_0658_0039_0003$$$::Even if he dies one minute from now, he doesn't know any other correct way to live.::
71645::$$$message_0658_0040_0000$$$::"...Hmph. I should say, I feel sentimental having confessed this.[lr]::
71646::$$$message_0658_0040_0001$$$::I wondered before, but now that we are here, I have realized something."::
71647::$$$message_0658_0041_0000$$$::He steps forward.[lr]::
71648::$$$message_0658_0041_0001$$$::Neither of us have much time left.[lr]::
71649::$$$message_0658_0041_0002$$$::So we'll settle this quickly.[lr]::
71650::$$$message_0658_0041_0003$$$::I'm going to snuff out his flame before mine runs out.::
71651::$$$message_0658_0042_0000$$$::"...I envy you all.[lr]::
71652::$$$message_0658_0042_0001$$$::I envy that which I sought but could never obtain; that which I could never attain even when I had it; those countless dregs which slipped through my fingers no matter which doctrine I followed."::

71657::$$$message_0658_0046_0001$$$::He searched and searched, but never gained even one bit of happiness.[lr]::
71658::$$$message_0658_0046_0002$$$::His life brought only death to anything he obtained.[lr]::
71659::$$$message_0658_0046_0003$$$::If it's the only way he ever lived, how could he ever abandon it now?::
71660::$$$message_0658_0047_0000$$$::"...I see. I've wasted your time, Kotomine."[lr]::
71661::$$$message_0658_0047_0001$$$::I restart my forgotten breathing.[lr]::
71662::$$$message_0658_0047_0002$$$::I send air into my lungs and switch my body over to combat mode.::
71663::$$$message_0658_0048_0000$$$::"I don't mind. Neither of us have any to spare, after all."[lr]::
71664::$$$message_0658_0048_0001$$$::Kotomine puts strength into his muscles.[lr]::
71665::$$$message_0658_0048_0002$$$::This won't be a battle of magecraft.[lr]::

71667::$$$message_0658_0048_0004$$$::All we can do is pound each other with our fists.[lr]::
71668::$$$message_0658_0048_0005$$$::We don't have any tactics or skills left. We're going to bash our remaining lives against each other.::
71669::$$$message_0658_0049_0000$$$::He'll kill me and grant his wish.[lr]::
71670::$$$message_0658_0049_0001$$$::I'll kill him and destroy his wish.[lr]::
71671::$$$message_0658_0049_0002$$$::We bet our lives on this wager.[lr]::
71672::$$$message_0658_0049_0003$$$::Before time runs out, I'll kill him and erase the Shadow.::
71673::$$$message_0658_0050_0000$$$::I run and make a beeline at my opponent.[lr]::
71674::$$$message_0658_0050_0001$$$::"...Hah."[lr]::
71675::$$$message_0658_0050_0002$$$::My legs don't have much power left.[lr]::
71676::$$$message_0658_0050_0003$$$::I drop my hips, eye the chest of my approaching opponent, and...[lr]::
71677::$$$message_0658_0050_0004$$$::"Aaaahhhhhhh!"[lr]::
71678::$$$message_0658_0050_0005$$$::Strike him as hard as I can, with undodgeable timing!::
71679::$$$message_0658_0051_0000$$$::But my right fist cuts through empty air, and it's my chest that takes an impact.::
71680::$$$message_0658_0052_0000$$$::"Guh!?"[lr]::
71681::$$$message_0658_0052_0001$$$::Kotomine is gone.[lr]::
71682::$$$message_0658_0052_0002$$$::The enemy I attacked with such speed and power disappears from sight.[lr]::
71683::$$$message_0658_0052_0003$$$::He bends his tall body to my left flank, drives a fist into my stomach,[lr]::
71684::$$$message_0658_0052_0004$$$::whips his legs like lightning, and kicks me into the air.::
71685::$$$message_0658_0053_0000$$$::"Hah...zzh...!"[lr]::
71686::$$$message_0658_0053_0001$$$::His kicks are like breaths of fire.[lr]::
71687::$$$message_0658_0053_0002$$$::In the last few hours here, I'd forgotten what it was like to feel pain strong enough to make me pass out.::
71688::$$$message_0658_0054_0000$$$::"Geegh..."[lr]::
71689::$$$message_0658_0054_0001$$$::How many meters was I launched?[lr]::
71690::$$$message_0658_0054_0002$$$::The impact was so strong, I wouldn't have been surprised if my head detached from my torso.[lr]::
71691::$$$message_0658_0054_0003$$$::No, if we're going with that, even the second blow to my stomach would have destroyed my organs.::
71692::$$$message_0658_0055_0000$$$::"You..."[lr]::
71693::$$$message_0658_0055_0001$$$::I know this.[lr]::
71694::$$$message_0658_0055_0002$$$::Untelegraphed economy of movement. Straight lines that are also circles. Attacks that emphasize internal over external damage...[lr]::
71695::$$$message_0658_0055_0003$$$::"You're a priest who uses Chinese martial arts...?"[lr]::
71696::$$$message_0658_0055_0004$$$::And at the highest level, too.[lr]::
71697::$$$message_0658_0055_0005$$$::This isn't something he could've just picked up by watching people!::
71698::$$$message_0658_0056_0000$$$::"Not quite. I simply imitate my teacher's [font italic=true]taolu[font italic=false]. My moves lack internal power...but it is sufficient against a dying man."::
71699::$$$message_0658_0057_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
71700::$$$message_0658_0057_0001$$$::The follow-up is coming.[lr]::
71701::$$$message_0658_0057_0002$$$::I force my stiffened joints to bend and get up.::
71702::$$$message_0658_0058_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
71703::$$$message_0658_0058_0001$$$::But then, Kotomine stops and looks at his fist.[lr]::
71704::$$$message_0658_0058_0002$$$::It's covered in red.[lr]::
71705::$$$message_0658_0058_0003$$$::"What a troublesome body. Each strike risks my life."[lr]::
71706::$$$message_0658_0058_0004$$$::That's...[lr]::
71707::$$$message_0658_0058_0005$$$::what he gets for hitting a bundle of blades.::
71708::$$$message_0658_0059_0000$$$::"Hah...ah..."[lr]::
71709::$$$message_0658_0059_0001$$$::I collect my scattered thoughts and face the enemy.[lr]::
71710::$$$message_0658_0059_0002$$$::None of that matters.[lr]::
71711::$$$message_0658_0059_0003$$$::He won't stop even if his opponent is covered with lethal thorns.::
71712::$$$message_0658_0060_0000$$$::"But it's a good handicap.[lr]::
71713::$$$message_0658_0060_0001$$$::An apt summary of our duel[line2]"::
71714::$$$message_0658_0061_0000$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
71715::$$$message_0658_0061_0001$$$::Kotomine lowers his stance.[lr]::
71716::$$$message_0658_0061_0002$$$::His trained body readies an explosive strike.::
71717::$$$message_0658_0062_0000$$$::"A battle not against an outside threat, but which wagers our very selves on the outcome!"::
71718::$$$message_0658_0063_0000$$$::    The enemy approaches.[lr]::
71719::$$$message_0658_0063_0001$$$::Kotomine has the overwelming edge in close-combat skills.[lr]::
71720::$$$message_0658_0063_0002$$$::His fists won't break.[lr]::
71721::$$$message_0658_0063_0003$$$::At this rate, my hourglass will shatter before it even runs out.::
71722::$$$message_0658_0064_0000$$$::"Hah..."[lr]::
71723::$$$message_0658_0064_0001$$$::I don't turn away, and meet my enemy approaching like a rocket.[lr]::
71724::$$$message_0658_0064_0002$$$::There's only one thing to do.[lr]::
71725::$$$message_0658_0064_0003$$$::I need to drive my fists at him even faster than last time, faster than he can dodge.::
71726::$$$message_0658_0065_0000$$$::    The only sound in my earlobes is my pounding heartbeat.[lr]::
71727::$$$message_0658_0065_0001$$$::I don't perceive the sounds of the collapsing cave and the rain of rubble at all.::
71728::$$$message_0658_0066_0000$$$::The thing I need to beat is right in front of me.[lr]::
71729::$$$message_0658_0066_0001$$$::I don't care about any centuries-long obsession or the collapse of a world.[lr]::
71730::$$$message_0658_0066_0002$$$::To Shirou Emiya...[lr]::
71731::$$$message_0658_0066_0003$$$::The defeat of this enemy is his final purpose.::
