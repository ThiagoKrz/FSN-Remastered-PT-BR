46547::$$$message_0412_0001_0000$$$::When I heard that from the man I believed could save everyone, all I felt was repulsion.::
46548::$$$message_0412_0002_0000$$$::                  "...Look, Shirou.[lr]::
46549::$$$message_0412_0002_0001$$$::                  A hero of justice can only save those he has sided with."::
46550::$$$message_0412_0003_0000$$$::I didn't like those words either.[lr]::
46551::$$$message_0412_0003_0001$$$::I didn't want the person who I thought was the hero of justice himself to say such realistic things.::
46552::$$$message_0412_0004_0000$$$::...Since that time, my life has just been trying to overturn those words.[lr]::
46553::$$$message_0412_0004_0001$$$::There is no need for sacrifices.[lr]::
46554::$$$message_0412_0004_0002$$$::Nobody will be hurt if you work hard and do your best.[lr]::
46555::$$$message_0412_0004_0003$$$::My old man must've always admired that as well.[lr]::
46556::$$$message_0412_0004_0004$$$::So...::
46557::$$$message_0412_0005_0000$$$::                                             "Yeah... I'm relieved."::
46558::$$$message_0412_0006_0000$$$::I can't look away from his final moment.::
46559::$$$message_0412_0007_0000$$$::Tohsaka said that such a life is distorted.[lr]::
46560::$$$message_0412_0007_0001$$$::...I know.[lr]::
46561::$$$message_0412_0007_0002$$$::I realized that a long time ago.::
46562::$$$message_0412_0008_0000$$$::There is no such world where nobody gets hurt,[lr]::
46563::$$$message_0412_0008_0001$$$::and there is no happiness where nobody gets hurt.[lr]::
46564::$$$message_0412_0008_0002$$$::Such a convenient utopia does not exist anywhere in this world.[lr]::
46565::$$$message_0412_0008_0003$$$::The hero of justice that I am trying to become is just hypocrisy.::
46566::$$$message_0412_0009_0000$$$::                                There is nothing at the end of helping people.::
46567::$$$message_0412_0010_0000$$$::So...[lr]::
46568::$$$message_0412_0010_0001$$$::I know that without having to be told.::
46569::$$$message_0412_0011_0000$$$::                    It is a false life where neither others nor yourself can be saved.::
46570::$$$message_0412_0012_0000$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
46571::$$$message_0412_0012_0001$$$::Even if that's true, I won't let you say it.::
46572::$$$message_0412_0013_0000$$$::I don't care if anyone other than him denies it.[lr]::
46573::$$$message_0412_0013_0001$$$::But I won't let him say it.[lr]::
46574::$$$message_0412_0013_0002$$$::The same things.[lr]::
46575::$$$message_0412_0013_0003$$$::We have the same beginnings, and even if I were to turn out like that... No, that's why I have to deny him.[lr]::
46576::$$$message_0412_0013_0004$$$::So that he doesn't approve of the former Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
46577::$$$message_0412_0013_0005$$$::As long as I am here, I won't approve of him.::
46578::$$$message_0412_0014_0000$$$::...Even if this dream is distorted.[lr]::
46579::$$$message_0412_0014_0001$$$::If I believed in this and decided that I will keep on believing in it, then I...::
46580::$$$message_0412_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46581::$$$message_0412_0015_0001$$$::I wake up.[lr]::
46582::$$$message_0412_0015_0002$$$::I look at the clock right away and see that it's past 11 PM.::
46583::$$$message_0412_0016_0000$$$::"Are you awake, Shirou?"[lr]::
46584::$$$message_0412_0016_0001$$$::Saber says in a calm voice, sitting on her knees.[lr]::
46585::$$$message_0412_0016_0002$$$::...It has already been half a day since we came back from the church.[lr]::
46586::$$$message_0412_0016_0003$$$::She must've been watching over me the whole time I was unconscious.::
46587::$$$message_0412_0017_0000$$$::"Yeah, I'm awake. My body is fine. My fatigue went away and my headache is gone."[lr]::
46588::$$$message_0412_0017_0001$$$::I get up from bed.[lr]::
46589::$$$message_0412_0017_0002$$$::The sensations in my limbs are back to usual.[lr]::
46590::$$$message_0412_0017_0003$$$::The Magic Circuit that I overused is still exhausted, but it hasn't burned up.::
46591::$$$message_0412_0018_0000$$$::"...Are you going, Shirou?"[lr]::
46592::$$$message_0412_0018_0001$$$::Saber suddenly asks.[lr]::
46593::$$$message_0412_0018_0002$$$::The answer's obvious, so I silently nod back.::
46594::$$$message_0412_0019_0000$$$::"...Understood. Then I shall go with you."[lr]::
46595::$$$message_0412_0019_0001$$$::But Shirou, Rin is my Master. It is my duty to rescue her. I will stop Archer, so you[line2]"::
46596::$$$message_0412_0020_0000$$$::"No, it's the other way around, Saber. I'll fight Archer."[lr]::
46597::$$$message_0412_0020_0001$$$::I interrupt Saber.[lr]::
46598::$$$message_0412_0020_0002$$$::She looks at me uneasily.[lr]::
46599::$$$message_0412_0020_0003$$$::"...No, Shirou.[lr]::
46600::$$$message_0412_0020_0004$$$::Archer is your..."[lr]::
46601::$$$message_0412_0020_0005$$$::She hesitates, having a hard time saying it.::
46602::$$$message_0412_0021_0000$$$::"I know. I think I knew who he was from the first time I met him."[lr]::
46603::$$$message_0412_0021_0001$$$::I was repulsed by him without reason from the first time we met.[lr]::
46604::$$$message_0412_0021_0002$$$::I stubbornly hated him, thinking that I could not approve of him.::
46605::$$$message_0412_0022_0000$$$::...That is only natural.[lr]::
46606::$$$message_0412_0022_0001$$$::Any person would look away if they are shown their own mistakes.::
46607::$$$message_0412_0023_0000$$$::"...Yeah. But, that's why I can't approve of what he did. I have to settle my match with him."::
46608::$$$message_0412_0024_0000$$$::I stand up.[lr]::
46609::$$$message_0412_0024_0001$$$::My body is in great condition.[lr]::
46610::$$$message_0412_0024_0002$$$::There's only half a day until time is up... I can't spend any more time resting.::
46611::$$$message_0412_0025_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
46612::$$$message_0412_0025_0001$$$::"...I'm not in the position to be able to say this, but please, Saber.[lr]::
46613::$$$message_0412_0025_0002$$$::I'll fight Archer. I don't want you to help me, no matter what happens."[lr]::
46614::$$$message_0412_0025_0003$$$::I bow as I ask Saber.::
46615::$$$message_0412_0026_0000$$$::"...No. There is no need to do that, Shirou.[lr]::
46616::$$$message_0412_0026_0001$$$::I shall obey if that is your wish.[lr]::
46617::$$$message_0412_0026_0002$$$::I swore that I would be your shield. I shall see your fate off until the end."::
46618::$$$message_0412_0027_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46619::$$$message_0412_0027_0001$$$::Her answer is perfect.[lr]::
46620::$$$message_0412_0027_0002$$$::Her dignified voice sweeps away the uneasiness lingering on my mind.::
46621::$$$message_0412_0028_0000$$$::"Thanks. It's reassuring to know that you'll be watching over me."[lr]::
46622::$$$message_0412_0028_0001$$$::"Yes. I am glad that you are you, Shirou."[lr]::
46623::$$$message_0412_0028_0002$$$::She smiles back.[lr]::
46624::$$$message_0412_0028_0003$$$::We've prepared for departure now.::
46625::$$$message_0412_0029_0000$$$::We leave my house.[lr]::
46626::$$$message_0412_0029_0001$$$::Who would've thought that we would go back to that castle again?::
46627::$$$message_0412_0030_0000$$$::"...Hey. You guys aren't listening to me, huh?"[lr]::
46628::$$$message_0412_0030_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
46629::$$$message_0412_0030_0002$$$::"What?"[lr]::
46630::$$$message_0412_0030_0003$$$::We both turn around.::
46631::$$$message_0412_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...Oh.[font italic=false][lr]::
46632::$$$message_0412_0031_0001$$$::Come to think of it, Lancer was still here.::
46633::$$$message_0412_0032_0000$$$::"...Oh. You have more free time than I thought."[lr]::
46634::$$$message_0412_0032_0001$$$::It just slips out.::
46635::$$$message_0412_0033_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
46636::$$$message_0412_0033_0001$$$::He seems to be aware of it himself, as he doesn't seem to deny it.::
46637::$$$message_0412_0034_0000$$$::"Lancer. I do not know what you are scheming, but you have nothing to gain by joining us.[lr]::
46638::$$$message_0412_0034_0001$$$::Archer is a Servant without a Master.[lr]::
46639::$$$message_0412_0034_0002$$$::I do not think that your Master would want to defeat him."::
46640::$$$message_0412_0035_0000$$$::"Yeah, I know, I know. I have no intention of fighting Archer. I won't interfere with their fight, so don't worry."::
46641::$$$message_0412_0036_0000$$$::"...Then, what are you following us for? If you wish to settle the score with me, we can do it right here."[lr]::
46642::$$$message_0412_0036_0001$$$::"No, I'll pass on that too. I have no intention of opposing your Master. Rather, I want to do her a favor. I want her to be in debt to me."::
46643::$$$message_0412_0037_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
46644::$$$message_0412_0037_0001$$$::Saber glares at Lancer,[lr]::
46645::$$$message_0412_0037_0002$$$::and Lancer aloofly ignores her stare.::
46646::$$$message_0412_0038_0000$$$::"...Fine, do as you wish. It would help us too if you'll help to rescue Tohsaka."[lr]::
46647::$$$message_0412_0038_0001$$$::"Shirou...! Lancer is an enemy. You cannot make such rash decisions[line2]"::
46648::$$$message_0412_0039_0000$$$::"Don't worry about that. He's twisted, but he doesn't lie, and he can't do anything that sneaky. He'd defeat us head on before he'd want to trick us."[lr]::
46649::$$$message_0412_0039_0001$$$::"Mrgh... That is true, but..."::
46650::$$$message_0412_0040_0000$$$::"Well, I'll drive him away if you don't want to. But he'll follow us even if we let him be. In that case, it's easier to have him by our side so we can keep an eye on him, right?"::
46651::$$$message_0412_0041_0000$$$::"Mrgh... You have become quite a smooth talker within just a few days, Shirou."[lr]::
46652::$$$message_0412_0041_0001$$$::"Well, a lot happened.[lr]::
46653::$$$message_0412_0041_0002$$$::Anyway, that's it, Lancer. We won't concern ourselves with you, so don't bother us either. If you're fine with that, let's go."::
46654::$$$message_0412_0042_0000$$$::I call to Lancer, who is watching us with a smile.::
46655::$$$message_0412_0043_0000$$$::"Good enough. Wow, you guys make a great pair.[lr]::
46656::$$$message_0412_0043_0001$$$::Saber is inflexible, just as she looks. It's good you became mature."::
46657::$$$message_0412_0044_0000$$$::"T-that is not true. Shirou is the inflexible one. You do not know how much trouble I have been through!"::
46658::$$$message_0412_0045_0000$$$::"I don't know.[lr]::
46659::$$$message_0412_0045_0001$$$::What, would you tell me if I ask? Fine, we have a lot of time until we get to the castle. Let's entertain ourselves on the road with your stories."::
46660::$$$message_0412_0046_0000$$$::"Mrgh...! W-why do I have to explain such a thing to you!? You have nothing to do with this!"[lr]::
46661::$$$message_0412_0046_0001$$$::Saber accuses Lancer.::
46662::$$$message_0412_0047_0000$$$::"...Wow."[lr]::
46663::$$$message_0412_0047_0001$$$::Saber and Lancer really don't get along.[lr]::
46664::$$$message_0412_0047_0002$$$::I didn't think that Saber would yell like Tohsaka.::
46665::$$$message_0412_0048_0000$$$::"...Oh well.[lr]::
46666::$$$message_0412_0048_0001$$$::Let's get going. We don't have the time to be playing around. We need to get to the castle as soon as possible."[lr]::
46667::$$$message_0412_0048_0002$$$::I leave the two behind and start walking.::
46668::$$$message_0412_0049_0000$$$::"S-Shirou...! I am not playing around!"[lr]::
46669::$$$message_0412_0049_0001$$$::She must still be worked up, as she yells as she catches up.[lr]::
46670::$$$message_0412_0049_0002$$$::Lancer keeps his distance from us and follows us aloofly.::
46671::$$$message_0412_0050_0000$$$::It's midnight.[lr]::
46672::$$$message_0412_0050_0001$$$::I know how long it takes to get to the castle from here.[lr]::
46673::$$$message_0412_0050_0002$$$::We should be able to make it in time.::
46674::$$$message_0412_0051_0000$$$::    We'll most likely get there by dawn.[lr]::
46675::$$$message_0412_0051_0001$$$::We head towards the masterless old castle in the forest and start walking in the night.::
