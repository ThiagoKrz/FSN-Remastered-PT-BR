19382::$$$message_0180_0000_0000$$$::The moon hangs high in the sky.[lr]::
19383::$$$message_0180_0000_0001$$$::The clouds have finally cleared and the black of night is giving way to indigo.[lr]::
19384::$$$message_0180_0000_0002$$$::It will be dawn soon.[lr]::
19385::$$$message_0180_0000_0003$$$::The long night is about to end.::
19386::$$$message_0180_0001_0000$$$::   It will be the last one.[lr]::
19387::$$$message_0180_0001_0001$$$::During the night, Saber and I traveled to our final destination.::
19388::$$$message_0180_0002_0000$$$::"Shirou...this..."[lr]::
19389::$$$message_0180_0002_0001$$$::I hear the tension in Saber's voice.[lr]::
19390::$$$message_0180_0002_0002$$$::She's not the only one.[lr]::
19391::$$$message_0180_0002_0003$$$::As I quietly nod, I feel a cold sweat trickling down my neck.::
19392::$$$message_0180_0003_0000$$$::The mountain feels like a living thing.[lr]::
19393::$$$message_0180_0003_0001$$$::Chills run down my spine. Stifling pressure assails me with every step I take.[lr]::
19394::$$$message_0180_0003_0002$$$::The air is thick and damp.::
19395::$$$message_0180_0004_0000$$$::"The mana is dense. It feels exactly the same as ten years ago. I expect that, at the very top..."[lr]::
19396::$$$message_0180_0004_0001$$$::The summoning of the Holy Grail has begun. Maybe it's even over by now.[lr]::
19397::$$$message_0180_0004_0002$$$::Either way, Gilgamesh has probably defeated Lancer.::
19398::$$$message_0180_0005_0000$$$::"Let's go over it one more time, Saber.[lr]::
19399::$$$message_0180_0005_0001$$$::Once we reach the top, the only thing left will be the fight. You take care of Gilgamesh, and I'll take care of the Master...Kotomine.[lr]::
19400::$$$message_0180_0005_0002$$$::Neither of us will get involved in the other's fight. If one of us defeats their opponent, that'll be the end of it."::
19401::$$$message_0180_0006_0000$$$::"Yes. This time, I will concentrate on my own fight. Kotomine is an enemy you must defeat yourself."[lr]::
19402::$$$message_0180_0006_0001$$$::"Right. Yeah, leave him to me. And Saber...don't let him beat you."::
19403::$$$message_0180_0007_0000$$$::"Yes. On my honor, I will not lose to him. Not as a Servant, but as a Heroic Spirit, I shall not submit to that king..."::
19404::$$$message_0180_0008_0000$$$::There is no longer hesitation or worry in her voice.[lr]::
19405::$$$message_0180_0008_0001$$$::I don't need to say anything else to her.[lr]::
19406::$$$message_0180_0008_0002$$$::We will head to battle and determine the final Master in this war.[lr]::
19407::$$$message_0180_0008_0003$$$::But if, in the process…[lr]::
19408::$$$message_0180_0008_0004$$$::...if one of us dies, the survivor just has to kill their opponent.::
19409::$$$message_0180_0009_0000$$$::Even if I'm defeated, as long as Saber defeats Gilgamesh, Kotomine won't get his hands on the Holy Grail.[lr]::
19410::$$$message_0180_0009_0001$$$::At the same time, if Saber is defeated but I defeat Kotomine, Gilgamesh can't stay manifested.[lr]::
19411::$$$message_0180_0009_0002$$$::So we don't have to cover for each other.[lr]::
19412::$$$message_0180_0009_0003$$$::This battle is now each of ours alone.::
19413::$$$message_0180_0010_0000$$$::And so we climb the stone steps.[lr]::
19414::$$$message_0180_0010_0001$$$::The closer we get to the temple gate, the denser the air gets.[lr]::
19415::$$$message_0180_0010_0002$$$::The red phosphorescence dances in the wind, and the whole place is too brightly lit for nighttime.::
19416::$$$message_0180_0011_0000$$$::The air is heavy with death.[lr]::
19417::$$$message_0180_0011_0001$$$::It reminds me...[lr]::
19418::$$$message_0180_0011_0002$$$::...of that fire ten years ago.::
19419::$$$message_0180_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19420::$$$message_0180_0012_0001$$$::But it's different.[lr]::
19421::$$$message_0180_0012_0002$$$::Bound up in the red light, I spy something that looks like it's going to ooze out over the temple itself.::
19422::$$$message_0180_0013_0000$$$::It's out, past the building.[lr]::
19423::$$$message_0180_0013_0001$$$::A glistening blackness, like mucus, spreads over the vivid red.[lr]::
19424::$$$message_0180_0013_0002$$$::The...mud spreads like oil over the clear ground.::
19425::$$$message_0180_0014_0000$$$::"You're finally here. I've been waiting, Saber."[lr]::
19426::$$$message_0180_0014_0001$$$::Gilgamesh stands there, haloed by the vivid red glow.[lr]::
19427::$$$message_0180_0014_0002$$$::He pays no mind to the bloodred glow or the death-shrouded blackness.[lr]::
19428::$$$message_0180_0014_0003$$$::The Servant armored in gold waits in the middle of the temple grounds for Saber and Saber alone.::
19429::$$$message_0180_0015_0000$$$::"You've come at a good time. The Holy Grail has finally decided to show itself, and it's starting to open up.[lr]::
19430::$$$message_0180_0015_0001$$$::This curse is what the Holy Grail holds within it. It's the Third Element that keeps us Servants in this world.[lr]::
19431::$$$message_0180_0015_0002$$$::It's what spilled onto me ten years ago."::
19432::$$$message_0180_0016_0000$$$::Gilgamesh has eyes only for Saber.[lr]::
19433::$$$message_0180_0016_0001$$$::Saber is similarly focused on him.[lr]::
19434::$$$message_0180_0016_0002$$$::She steps forward and points her sword at the knight in front of her.::
19435::$$$message_0180_0017_0000$$$::"That's the spirit.[lr]::
19436::$$$message_0180_0017_0001$$$::You know you can't possibly win, but you are still defiant, showing your fighting spirit. You are truly a fitting finale for this festival."::
19437::$$$message_0180_0018_0000$$$::"I will not permit any outsiders to interfere. You, mongrel. If you plan to fight Kotomine, begone. He awaits you at the altar."::
19438::$$$message_0180_0019_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
19439::$$$message_0180_0019_0001$$$::Kotomine's waiting?::
19440::$$$message_0180_0020_0000$$$::I glance at Saber.[lr]::
19441::$$$message_0180_0020_0001$$$::She gives a slight nod, her eyes still on Gilgamesh.[lr]::
19442::$$$message_0180_0020_0002$$$::As I leave...[lr]::
19443::$$$message_0180_0020_0003$$$::...I feel her wishing me luck.::
19444::$$$message_0180_0021_0000$$$::I turn around.[lr]::
19445::$$$message_0180_0021_0001$$$::My opponent is elsewhere.[lr]::
19446::$$$message_0180_0021_0002$$$::Behind me...[lr]::
19447::$$$message_0180_0021_0003$$$::As I run, I hear[se volume=50 storage=se174] the sound of Saber's deadly battle beginning.::
19448::$$$message_0180_0022_0000$$$::Deep in the grounds...[lr]::
19449::$$$message_0180_0022_0001$$$::Behind Ryudou Temple's main building is a large lake.[lr]::
19450::$$$message_0180_0022_0002$$$::It's been untouched for a long time, making it seem sacred, like it's inhabited by a dragon god.[lr]::
19451::$$$message_0180_0022_0003$$$::The lake's clear, blue water is so pure and clean, with not a trace of cloudiness.::
19452::$$$message_0180_0023_0000$$$::At least, that was true until yesterday.[lr]::
19453::$$$message_0180_0023_0001$$$::The lake is far from pure now.[lr]::
19454::$$$message_0180_0023_0002$$$::Red phosphorescence spreads out before me.[lr]::
19455::$$$message_0180_0023_0003$$$::It is a sea of dark, murky tar.[lr]::
19456::$$$message_0180_0023_0004$$$::And...::
19457::$$$message_0180_0024_0000$$$::A hollow chasm yawns in midair, the body of a young girl floating near, in offering.::
19458::$$$message_0180_0025_0000$$$::"Koto...mine...!!!"[lr]::
19459::$$$message_0180_0025_0001$$$::I've been trying to remain calm all this time, but that sight drives me over the edge.[lr]::
19460::$$$message_0180_0025_0002$$$::I stop and glare at the enemy.::
19461::$$$message_0180_0026_0000$$$::"Welcome, Shirou Emiya, the final surviving Master."[lr]::
19462::$$$message_0180_0026_0001$$$::The ends of his lips curl up in a smile, and he spreads his arms in greeting.[lr]::
19463::$$$message_0180_0026_0002$$$::Our final battle will be fought here.[lr]::
19464::$$$message_0180_0026_0003$$$::This will be the summoning altar in this Holy Grail War.::
19465::$$$message_0180_0027_0000$$$::"Put down Illya. I'll thrash you after that."[lr]::
19466::$$$message_0180_0027_0001$$$::I glare at Kotomine.[lr]::
19467::$$$message_0180_0027_0002$$$::We're about ten meters apart.[lr]::
19468::$$$message_0180_0027_0003$$$::As soon as I take another step, the battle will begin.[lr]::
19469::$$$message_0180_0027_0004$$$::Once the battle starts, my only option is to rush him and stab him in the chest.[lr]::
19470::$$$message_0180_0027_0005$$$::But before that, I need to do something about Illya...::
19471::$$$message_0180_0028_0000$$$::"Hey. Did you hear me? I told you to put Illya down. What kind of scum are you, taking pleasure in tormenting a child like her?"::
19472::$$$message_0180_0029_0000$$$::"Oh, I heard you, but I cannot do as you ask. The Holy Grail has appeared, but its hollow is still unstable.[lr]::
19473::$$$message_0180_0029_0001$$$::As the point of contact with the Holy Grail, I need her to endure for as long as her life lasts, or else my wish will not be granted."[lr]::
19474::$$$message_0180_0029_0002$$$::As long as her life lasts...? Then Illya's still alive!::
19475::$$$message_0180_0030_0000$$$::"If you have no intention of bringing her down, I'll have to make you.[lr]::
19476::$$$message_0180_0030_0001$$$::I'm going to stop your wish...this dark mud, right here, right now!"::
19477::$$$message_0180_0031_0000$$$::"Ah, I see. Do you believe this is my wish? I have to hand it to Kiritsugu, his son has [font italic=true]such[font italic=false] a keen sense of things.[lr]::
19478::$$$message_0180_0031_0001$$$::What a shock. Two generations of Emiyas, completely mistaken."[lr]::
19479::$$$message_0180_0031_0002$$$::"Wh...at!?"::
19480::$$$message_0180_0032_0000$$$::"I have no obligation to explain anything to one who does not understand the Holy Grail. You shall fulfill your role as the final Master, burdened by that misconception all the while.[lr]::
19481::$$$message_0180_0032_0001$$$::[font italic=true]What!?[font italic=false]::
19482::$$$message_0180_0033_0000$$$::I kick off as quickly as I can.[lr]::
19483::$$$message_0180_0033_0001$$$::There's only about ten meters between him and me, but I jump to the side, maintaining that distance.[lr]::
19484::$$$message_0180_0033_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19485::$$$message_0180_0033_0003$$$::Rather than acting on my desire to kill him...[lr]::
19486::$$$message_0180_0033_0004$$$::...my instincts kick in to help me avoid death.::
19487::$$$message_0180_0034_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
19488::$$$message_0180_0034_0001$$$::I slip sideways and roll on the ground.[lr]::
19489::$$$message_0180_0034_0002$$$::I go tumbling across the ground, scrambling to look up.::
19490::$$$message_0180_0035_0000$$$::"That was...!"[lr]::
19491::$$$message_0180_0035_0001$$$::I glance back at where I'd just been running.[lr]::
19492::$$$message_0180_0035_0002$$$::The ground is on fire.[lr]::
19493::$$$message_0180_0035_0003$$$::The dark mud spreading over the lake is steaming. [lr]::
19494::$$$message_0180_0035_0004$$$::It's like a dark carpet.[lr]::
19495::$$$message_0180_0035_0005$$$::The mud coils and lunges at me, snapping like a whip. It leaves a searing welt on the ground.::
19496::$$$message_0180_0036_0000$$$::"I should have mentioned that you are already well within my reach. Moreover, this stuff is extraordinarily responsive to the presence of living things.[lr]::
19497::$$$message_0180_0036_0001$$$::Dart around all you like, but if you are not careful as you do so, you will die."::
19498::$$$message_0180_0037_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
19499::$$$message_0180_0037_0001$$$::I leap out of the way of the black mud as it strikes at me once again.[lr]::
19500::$$$message_0180_0037_0002$$$::To hell with darting around blindly...this bastard's intent on killing me.::
19501::$$$message_0180_0038_0000$$$::"Kngh...you damn fake priest!"[lr]::
19502::$$$message_0180_0038_0001$$$::I reposition myself, keeping an eye on the lake.[lr]::
19503::$$$message_0180_0038_0002$$$::I'm no closer to Kotomine.[lr]::
19504::$$$message_0180_0038_0003$$$::Looks like he's gonna keep me ten meters away.[lr]::
19505::$$$message_0180_0038_0004$$$::That muddy tentacle seems to be able to stretch endlessly.[lr]::
19506::$$$message_0180_0038_0005$$$::It follows no matter how far I retreat, and it's not the only one.::
19507::$$$message_0180_0039_0000$$$::"Oh? Are you ready to face me? Good. I'm pleased.[lr]::
19508::$$$message_0180_0039_0001$$$::Had you just walked away, I would have had no way to kill you. But if you desire to fight, I have no issue.[lr]::
19509::$$$message_0180_0039_0002$$$::I am, after all, a humble servant of God, and could never kill one seeking salvation or aid."::
19510::$$$message_0180_0040_0000$$$::The tentacle twists toward me.[lr]::
19511::$$$message_0180_0040_0001$$$::It looms over the lake, its sickle-shaped head like a dark serpent.::
19512::$$$message_0180_0041_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19513::$$$message_0180_0041_0001$$$::I bite my lip.[lr]::
19514::$$$message_0180_0041_0002$$$::I'm in about the worst possible situation here.[lr]::
19515::$$$message_0180_0041_0003$$$::More and more tentacles emerge from the lake.[lr]::
19516::$$$message_0180_0041_0004$$$::I'm not sure how much longer I can even survive, to say nothing of getting near Kotomine.::
19517::$$$message_0180_0042_0000$$$::"You obviously have no chance of winning.[lr]::
19518::$$$message_0180_0042_0001$$$::The gap in our experience is considerable. Unless you have some major factor which can multiply your experience, that difference will not be easily overcome."::
19519::$$$message_0180_0043_0000$$$::The priest raises his hands.[lr]::
19520::$$$message_0180_0043_0001$$$::He stares at the heavens like a conductor leading an orchestra.::
19521::$$$message_0180_0044_0000$$$::"Put your life on the line.[lr]::
19522::$$$message_0180_0044_0001$$$::Maybe then you will be able to reach me!"::
19523::$$$message_0180_0045_0000$$$::The serpents surge forward.::
19524::$$$message_0180_0046_0000$$$::"Gngh...!"[lr]::
19525::$$$message_0180_0046_0001$$$::I try to kick away the mud clinging to my ankles.[lr]::
19526::$$$message_0180_0046_0002$$$::My clothes are burnt, and my skin is exposed.::
19527::$$$message_0180_0047_0000$$$::"Ngh...ghhh!"[lr]::
19528::$$$message_0180_0047_0001$$$::I jump away from the lunging tentacle.[lr]::
19529::$$$message_0180_0047_0002$$$::I can't feel my mud-coated right ankle, and I wasn't entirely sure I even still had my right leg until I used it to leap away.::
19530::$$$message_0180_0048_0000$$$::"Tah! Ha...haaah...haa...ah!"[lr]::
19531::$$$message_0180_0048_0001$$$::I check my body while I roll.[lr]::
19532::$$$message_0180_0048_0002$$$::Ankle...okay, yeah it's still there. I just can't feel it. If it's more or less intact, I can still probably run.::
19533::$$$message_0180_0049_0000$$$::"Ah...haaa...ha...ah!"[lr]::
19534::$$$message_0180_0049_0001$$$::I jump in another direction to avoid the mud's relentless attacks.[lr]::
19535::$$$message_0180_0049_0002$$$::Beside me, I hear a splash.[lr]::
19536::$$$message_0180_0049_0003$$$::The scent of burning earth wakes my dizzy head, and I push myself back up to my feet.::
19537::$$$message_0180_0050_0000$$$::"Hnnnnnnnnnh!!!"[lr]::
19538::$$$message_0180_0050_0001$$$::A burning sensation sears its way down my back.[lr]::
19539::$$$message_0180_0050_0002$$$::"Ha...the...hell...?"[lr]::
19540::$$$message_0180_0050_0003$$$::I shake it off and jump to the closest clear ground.[lr]::
19541::$$$message_0180_0050_0004$$$::The mud's pursuit relents.[lr]::
19542::$$$message_0180_0050_0005$$$::I can no longer see any of the black mud that surrounded me.::
19543::$$$message_0180_0051_0000$$$::"Ha...ah...ah."[lr]::
19544::$$$message_0180_0051_0001$$$::I bite my lip.[lr]::
19545::$$$message_0180_0051_0002$$$::I dodged and ran all over the place. But in the end..[lr]::
19546::$$$message_0180_0051_0003$$$::I'm right back here.::
19547::$$$message_0180_0052_0000$$$::"Ha...haaah...ha..."[lr]::
19548::$$$message_0180_0052_0001$$$::I calm my breathing, and look up at him to at least show he hasn't broken my spirit.[lr]::
19549::$$$message_0180_0052_0002$$$::Kotomine has not moved at all. He's just watched me running around.::
19550::$$$message_0180_0053_0000$$$::"Ha...ha...haaa...ha...haaa."[lr]::
19551::$$$message_0180_0053_0001$$$::No matter how many deep breaths I take, my heart won't stop pounding.[lr]::
19552::$$$message_0180_0053_0002$$$::It's warning me that it's at its limit. It needs rest. My heart is ready to burst if I don't rest. That's how rapidly it's thumping in my chest. It's all but jumping out of my mouth at this point.::
19553::$$$message_0180_0054_0000$$$::"Ku...ha...haaa...a...aaah."[lr]::
19554::$$$message_0180_0054_0001$$$::I can't do anything.[lr]::
19555::$$$message_0180_0054_0002$$$::I can't get near Kotomine and I can't stop that black mud.[lr]::
19556::$$$message_0180_0054_0003$$$::There's not enough time for me to hold back about using Projection; it's my only hope.::
19557::$$$message_0180_0055_0000$$$::If there's no way forward, I just have to Project Saber's sword again.[lr]::
19558::$$$message_0180_0055_0001$$$::It should be able to cut through that black mud and give me a chance to rush Kotomine.::
19559::$$$message_0180_0056_0000$$$::"Hm? Is that all? If you've given up, say so."[lr]::
19560::$$$message_0180_0056_0001$$$::The moment he speaks...[lr]::
19561::$$$message_0180_0056_0002$$$::"Ha...ah..ha!?"[lr]::
19562::$$$message_0180_0056_0003$$$::A tidal wave of mud crashes over me.::
19563::$$$message_0180_0057_0000$$$::"Kngh!"[lr]::
19564::$$$message_0180_0057_0001$$$::I look up just in time to dodge.[lr]::
19565::$$$message_0180_0057_0002$$$::The mud itself isn't bad.[lr]::
19566::$$$message_0180_0057_0003$$$::It's slow compared to Saber's strikes when we sparred, and it doesn't change direction so it's easy to dodge.::
19567::$$$message_0180_0058_0000$$$::But that only applies when there's just one tentacle.[lr]::
19568::$$$message_0180_0058_0001$$$::I can't handle multiple attacks at once, or those that strike from behind as soon as I've dodged another.[lr]::
19569::$$$message_0180_0058_0002$$$::As a result, I can only move around, and still, mud slowly covers me.::
19570::$$$message_0180_0059_0000$$$::"Ha...get away!"[lr]::
19571::$$$message_0180_0059_0001$$$::There's no time to rest.[lr]::
19572::$$$message_0180_0059_0002$$$::I'm not going to be able to use my Projection.[lr]::
19573::$$$message_0180_0059_0003$$$::Projection requires me to form an image of a weapon from the very beginning, so I need at least a full minute of concentration.[lr]::
19574::$$$message_0180_0059_0004$$$::But if I give Kotomine an opening like that, the only thing left of me will be smoking bones.::
19575::$$$message_0180_0060_0000$$$::"Hah...ha...ha...ha...ha...ah...!"[lr]::
19576::$$$message_0180_0060_0001$$$::Everywhere the mud touches me, I go numb.[lr]::
19577::$$$message_0180_0060_0002$$$::At least it's not painful, but if that mud covers my entire body, I might not even know whether I'm dead or alive.[lr]::
19578::$$$message_0180_0060_0003$$$::If that happens, I'm a goner. I'd melt away...bones and all.::
19579::$$$message_0180_0061_0000$$$::"Ha...haaa...ha...ha...ha!"[lr]::
19580::$$$message_0180_0061_0001$$$::I can only run.[lr]::
19581::$$$message_0180_0061_0002$$$::If I'm going to have any chance of getting near him, I have to do something about this mud...[lr]::
19582::$$$message_0180_0061_0003$$$::"Ow...tsh...ah!?"::
19583::$$$message_0180_0062_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
19584::$$$message_0180_0062_0001$$$::I-I can't believe it! I pick now, of all times, to trip!?::
19585::$$$message_0180_0063_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19586::$$$message_0180_0063_0001$$$::Kotomine stares down at me as if I were a piece of trash.[lr]::
19587::$$$message_0180_0063_0002$$$::He points a finger at me, and several snake heads rear up from the lake.::
19588::$$$message_0180_0064_0000$$$::"What the...!?"[lr]::
19589::$$$message_0180_0064_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Get up.[font italic=false][lr]::
19590::$$$message_0180_0064_0002$$$::I try to get up, but fall again.[lr]::
19591::$$$message_0180_0064_0003$$$::"...Eh?"::
19592::$$$message_0180_0065_0000$$$::I fall.[lr]::
19593::$$$message_0180_0065_0001$$$::I fall.[lr]::
19594::$$$message_0180_0065_0002$$$::The snakes pursue me.::
19595::$$$message_0180_0066_0000$$$::But I still fall.[lr]::
19596::$$$message_0180_0066_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Why?[font italic=false][lr]::
19597::$$$message_0180_0066_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Why?[font italic=false][lr]::
19598::$$$message_0180_0066_0003$$$::[font italic=true]Why?[font italic=false][lr]::
19599::$$$message_0180_0066_0004$$$::Black mud splashes over the back of my neck.[lr]::
19600::$$$message_0180_0066_0005$$$::[font italic=true]Why?[font italic=false][lr]::
19601::$$$message_0180_0066_0006$$$::Now that I look closer...[lr]::
19602::$$$message_0180_0066_0007$$$::...my right leg is entirely black.::
19603::$$$message_0180_0067_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
19604::$$$message_0180_0067_0001$$$::Black mud rains down on me.[lr]::
19605::$$$message_0180_0067_0002$$$::Like a torrential downpour, it engulfs my entire body, and all I can do is await the oncoming tide of despair.::
