54262::$$$message_0475_0000_0000$$$::    I have to decide what I'm going to do next.::
54263::$$$message_0475_0001_0000$$$::I chose to keep fighting.[lr]::
54264::$$$message_0475_0001_0001$$$::Zouken Matou and Assassin...[lr]::
54265::$$$message_0475_0001_0002$$$::The black Shadow roaming the town...[lr]::
54266::$$$message_0475_0001_0003$$$::Masters fighting each other over the Holy Grail...[lr]::
54267::$$$message_0475_0001_0004$$$::I decided I'd stop it all, even if I lost Saber.[lr]::
54268::$$$message_0475_0001_0005$$$::This is not time to worry about appearances.[lr]::
54269::$$$message_0475_0001_0006$$$::I need Tohsaka's help if I want to prevent any further victims.::
54270::$$$message_0475_0002_0000$$$::"Tohsaka.[lr]::
54271::$$$message_0475_0002_0001$$$::I've lost Saber and my Command Spells, so I'm not a Master anymore, right?"::
54272::$$$message_0475_0003_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I forgot that important detail. You're not a Master anymore. You don't need to involve yourself with the Holy Grail War, and you're less likely to be targeted by the other Masters now."::
54273::$$$message_0475_0004_0000$$$::"Right. I wanted the Grail because Saber said she needed it. Now that she's gone, I'm not interested in it anymore."[lr]::
54274::$$$message_0475_0004_0001$$$::"Okay. So you're going to stop fighting?"::
54275::$$$message_0475_0005_0000$$$::Tohsaka's eyes are stoic.[lr]::
54276::$$$message_0475_0005_0001$$$::She asks me the question as a Master, evenly and without letting her own emotions cloud it.::
54277::$$$message_0475_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
54278::$$$message_0475_0006_0001$$$::It's a warning, not a question.[lr]::
54279::$$$message_0475_0006_0002$$$::This is my last chance.[lr]::
54280::$$$message_0475_0006_0003$$$::She's giving me fair warning that it isn't too late to turn back.::
54281::$$$message_0475_0007_0000$$$::"...No."[lr]::
54282::$$$message_0475_0007_0001$$$::But my answer was decided long ago.[lr]::
54283::$$$message_0475_0007_0002$$$::I'm going to remember how considerate she was for asking me.::
54284::$$$message_0475_0008_0000$$$::"Of course not. I won't forfeit this war, even if I'm not a Master. I decided I'd fight to put a stop to it."[lr]::
54285::$$$message_0475_0008_0001$$$::"All right. Then we can continue our relationship.[lr]::
54286::$$$message_0475_0008_0002$$$::We're mutual enemies, but we have a truce until we beat that 'Shadow' thing."::
54287::$$$message_0475_0009_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
54288::$$$message_0475_0009_0001$$$::Tohsaka smiles suddenly.[lr]::
54289::$$$message_0475_0009_0002$$$::Her stoicness from a moment ago turns to friendliness, as if something nice just happened.[lr]::
54290::$$$message_0475_0009_0003$$$::...That's fine, I guess. It's not like I'd know why.::
54291::$$$message_0475_0010_0000$$$::"Hang on. Why are we enemies?[lr]::
54292::$$$message_0475_0010_0001$$$::I'm not a Master anymore. I have no reason to compete with you."::
54293::$$$message_0475_0011_0000$$$::"What are you talking about? You might've lost your Servant and Command Spells, but that doesn't mean you aren't Saber's Master.[lr]::
54294::$$$message_0475_0011_0001$$$::You were chosen by the Holy Grail, even if it wasn't according to plan. That means you have a right to it, too. You might be neutralized for now, but you're still a contender."::
54295::$$$message_0475_0012_0000$$$::"I am? Even if I don't care about getting the Holy Grail?"::
54296::$$$message_0475_0013_0000$$$::That depends on the situation. It's completely possible that you might get the Holy Grail and find yourself in a situation where you need its power.[lr]::
54297::$$$message_0475_0013_0001$$$::People without greed are influenced by external factors precisely because they have no personal desires."::
54298::$$$message_0475_0014_0000$$$::"Hrm. You're overthinking this, Tohsaka. Even if I needed the Grail, there's no way I'd get it."::
54299::$$$message_0475_0015_0000$$$::"It's just hypothetical, but the possibility isn't zero.[lr]::
54300::$$$message_0475_0015_0001$$$::That's why I consider us enemies. It's why mages who aren't Masters anymore flee to the church for sanctuary.[lr]::
54301::$$$message_0475_0015_0002$$$::Even if they've lost their Servants, they're still nuisances to the other Masters. You'd better be careful. Zouken isn't the only one gunning for you."::
54302::$$$message_0475_0016_0000$$$::"Mrgh...I'll accept your advice."[lr]::
54303::$$$message_0475_0016_0001$$$::I'm not happy about still being enemies with her.::
54304::$$$message_0475_0017_0000$$$::"Hm? What's the complicated expression for? I said we're enemies, but things will stay the same. What's there to worry about?"[lr]::
54305::$$$message_0475_0017_0001$$$::"Plenty. Because then I can't ask you for help."::
54306::$$$message_0475_0018_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
54307::$$$message_0475_0018_0001$$$::She freezes.[lr]::
54308::$$$message_0475_0018_0002$$$::Tohsaka stares at me like she's just seen a ghost.::
54309::$$$message_0475_0019_0000$$$::You want my help? Why...?::
54310::$$$message_0475_0020_0000$$$::"Because I definitely can't do this on my own. I need to defeat the other Masters to stop the war, but I don't have the power to do that."::
54311::$$$message_0475_0021_0000$$$::"...I know it sounds pathetic, but I can't worry about appearances. Out of the few options I have left, I think this is the best one.[lr]::
54312::$$$message_0475_0021_0001$$$::So I can't be enemies with you, Tohsaka.[lr]::
54313::$$$message_0475_0021_0002$$$::   I want you to help me, not just honor a truce."::
54314::$$$message_0475_0022_0000$$$::"...Hold on. Have you lost your mind?"[lr]::
54315::$$$message_0475_0022_0001$$$::"I'm completely sane. I'm not strong, and I might drag you down.[lr]::
54316::$$$message_0475_0022_0002$$$::You don't have anything to gain by teaming up with me, and I have no way to repay you.[lr]::
54317::$$$message_0475_0022_0003$$$::...Yeah. Normally, there wouldn't be any reason to form an alliance."::
54318::$$$message_0475_0023_0000$$$::"H-hmph. So you understand that much.[lr]::
54319::$$$message_0475_0023_0001$$$::As you said, equivalent exchange is a fundamental idea in magecraft. I can't help someone who has nothing to give in return, nor can I help someone who can't contribute to the team effort. You know as well as I do that it wouldn't be good for you."::
54320::$$$message_0475_0024_0000$$$::"I've been letting you consult me during our truce, but an alliance is a different story. If we're going to be friends who help each other, then there has to be something in it for both of us."::
54321::$$$message_0475_0025_0000$$$::"Yeah. I knew that when I asked.[lr]::
54322::$$$message_0475_0025_0001$$$::   Help me, Tohsaka. I'll pay you back as long as I live."::
54323::$$$message_0475_0026_0000$$$::"As long as you live, huh?"::
54324::$$$message_0475_0027_0000$$$::...I know what a burden I'd be to her.[lr]::
54325::$$$message_0475_0027_0001$$$::But Tohsaka's the most reliable person I know, and if she's the one who gets the Holy Grail, I can trust that nothing will go wrong.[lr]::
54326::$$$message_0475_0027_0002$$$::So she's the only one I can think of helping win as a Master.::
54327::$$$message_0475_0028_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. I'd like to hear your answer."[lr]::
54328::$$$message_0475_0028_0001$$$::I meet her eyes.[lr]::
54329::$$$message_0475_0028_0002$$$::"...I-it's obvious, isn't it? I'm not going to team up with someone who isn't a Master[line2]"::
54330::$$$message_0475_0029_0000$$$::"Tohsaka."[lr]::
54331::$$$message_0475_0029_0001$$$::"I told you, even if you insist, I can't help you. To begin with[line2]"::
54332::$$$message_0475_0030_0000$$$::"Tohsaka."[lr]::
54333::$$$message_0475_0030_0001$$$::"...It's like we're talking about a real contract, you know?"::
54334::$$$message_0475_0031_0000$$$::There it is.[lr]::
54335::$$$message_0475_0031_0001$$$::Tohsaka makes a show of looking down.[lr]::
54336::$$$message_0475_0031_0002$$$::"Oh, fine! I get it! Here's my conditions, then!"[lr]::
54337::$$$message_0475_0031_0003$$$::She shoots a hard gaze right back at me.::
54338::$$$message_0475_0032_0000$$$::"What conditions?"[lr]::
54339::$$$message_0475_0032_0001$$$::"My conditions for this deal![lr]::
54340::$$$message_0475_0032_0002$$$::...I'm talking about a proper contract.[lr]::
54341::$$$message_0475_0032_0003$$$::If you mean what you just said, then I can think of a way to make it work."::
54342::$$$message_0475_0033_0000$$$::"??? Tohsaka, I've been saying this whole time that I don't have anything to pay you with."[lr]::
54343::$$$message_0475_0033_0001$$$::"Just listen!"[lr]::
54344::$$$message_0475_0033_0002$$$::"...! O-okay, go ahead."::
54345::$$$message_0475_0034_0000$$$::"All right. First. We can have an alliance, but will you do what I tell you to?[lr]::
54346::$$$message_0475_0034_0001$$$::You'll absolutely follow my orders if we get into a battle?"[lr]::
