74426::$$$message_0682_0000_0001$$$::Clearly, something is happening in the backyard.[lr]::
74427::$$$message_0682_0000_0002$$$::So much of the nauseating, spiteful vortex of energy is leaking out that I can even touch it.[lr]::
74428::$$$message_0682_0000_0003$$$::You don't need to be a mage to know that something's wrong.::
74429::$$$message_0682_0001_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
74430::$$$message_0682_0001_0001$$$::I thought I was ready, but I'm dumbstruck by what I find.[lr]::
74431::$$$message_0682_0001_0002$$$::Tohsaka's covered in the Shadow that looks like coal tar.[lr]::
74432::$$$message_0682_0001_0003$$$::Illya's watching from the edge of the yard, and Saber's standing in front of her.[lr]::
74433::$$$message_0682_0001_0004$$$::And in the very middle, Sakura has a hand thrust out at Tohsaka...::
74434::$$$message_0682_0002_0000$$$::"SAKURA!!!"[lr]::
74435::$$$message_0682_0002_0001$$$::I dash into the yard.[lr]::
74436::$$$message_0682_0002_0002$$$::   I can't neglect any of them, but right now, Tohsaka's in the most danger.[lr]::
74437::$$$message_0682_0002_0003$$$::She looks deathly pale beneath the coal tar, and her life will be in danger unless she gets help right away.::
74438::$$$message_0682_0003_0000$$$::"Tohsaka...! Hey, get a grip, stupid!"[lr]::
74439::$$$message_0682_0003_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74440::$$$message_0682_0003_0002$$$::I lift her up, but she doesn't respond.[lr]::
74441::$$$message_0682_0003_0003$$$::"Kuh! Hold on, I'll get this stuff off you!"::
74442::$$$message_0682_0004_0000$$$::I tear at the mud covering her.[lr]::
74443::$$$message_0682_0004_0001$$$::But despite being a liquid, the mud behaves like elastic rubber.[lr]::
74444::$$$message_0682_0004_0002$$$::I can't get a decent handhold on it, and it bounces back as soon as I tear it off...!::
74445::$$$message_0682_0005_0000$$$::"Rrgh...! What it this!? It can touch Tohsaka, so why can't I...!?"[lr]::
74446::$$$message_0682_0005_0001$$$::I can't tear the mud off, no matter how hard I try.[lr]::
74447::$$$message_0682_0005_0002$$$::In the chaos and confusion, I keep trying to pull the mud off Tohsaka.::
74448::$$$message_0682_0006_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
74449::$$$message_0682_0006_0001$$$::"It's no use, Senpai. Only I can dispel my own shadow. With your skill level, it'll only consume you, instead."[lr]::
74450::$$$message_0682_0006_0002$$$::"Sakura?"[lr]::
74451::$$$message_0682_0006_0003$$$::Sakura speaks in a cold voice I don't know.::
74452::$$$message_0682_0007_0000$$$::"Sakura...your face."[lr]::
74453::$$$message_0682_0007_0001$$$::My scattered mind grinds to a halt.::
74454::$$$message_0682_0008_0000$$$::Sakura's neck...[lr]::
74455::$$$message_0682_0008_0001$$$::Something that looks like a tattoo is spreading over it.[lr]::
74456::$$$message_0682_0008_0002$$$::It doesn't look like it at all, but that's...a Command Spell.[lr]::
74457::$$$message_0682_0008_0003$$$::Sakura's body is writhing with Command Spells I don't understand.::
74458::$$$message_0682_0009_0000$$$::"...What a surprise. You came so quickly, Senpai.[lr]::
74459::$$$message_0682_0009_0001$$$::But you must be panicking. You saw what happened to Nii-san, but you aren't scolding me."[lr]::
74460::$$$message_0682_0009_0002$$$::"Rgh... not now. We don't need to talk about Shinji right now. It can wait until you calm down."::
74461::$$$message_0682_0010_0000$$$::...That's right.[lr]::
74462::$$$message_0682_0010_0001$$$::I need to talk to Sakura now.[lr]::
74463::$$$message_0682_0010_0002$$$::Zouken said all kinds of stuff, but he was lying.[lr]::
74464::$$$message_0682_0010_0003$$$::Sakura is still Sakura.[lr]::
74465::$$$message_0682_0010_0004$$$::So if we can just talk, she'll go back to[line2]::
74466::$$$message_0682_0011_0000$$$::"No. I don't want to talk about that, and I don't want to talk to you. I'm the only one who needs to speak.[lr]::
74467::$$$message_0682_0011_0001$$$::You, Nee-san, my brother, and all the people in this town can't speak out against me anymore."::
74468::$$$message_0682_0012_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
74469::$$$message_0682_0012_0001$$$::My hair stands on end.[lr]::
74470::$$$message_0682_0012_0002$$$::This is worse than any chill.[lr]::
74471::$$$message_0682_0012_0003$$$::A sharp spike of extreme cold runs from my medulla down to the bottom of my spine, like a knife opening up my back.::
74472::$$$message_0682_0013_0000$$$::"Anyway, Senpai. Why are you protecting my sister?"[lr]::
74473::$$$message_0682_0013_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74474::$$$message_0682_0013_0002$$$::For an instant, my vision goes blank.[lr]::
74475::$$$message_0682_0013_0003$$$::A shadow rises behind Sakura.::
74476::$$$message_0682_0014_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
74477::$$$message_0682_0014_0001$$$::The chill running down my back crystallizes into ice-cold terror encasing my entire body.[lr]::
74478::$$$message_0682_0014_0002$$$::That's...Sakura.[lr]::
74479::$$$message_0682_0014_0003$$$::When people told me that she's the Shadow, I was able to bear it.[lr]::
74480::$$$message_0682_0014_0004$$$::But I can't deny what I just saw.::
74481::$$$message_0682_0015_0000$$$::All it took was a touch to melt my left arm.[lr]::
74482::$$$message_0682_0015_0001$$$::That emotionless killing machine slaughtering people all over town was...Sakura.::
74483::$$$message_0682_0016_0000$$$::"Saku...ra..."[lr]::
74484::$$$message_0682_0016_0001$$$::My throat feels tight.[lr]::
74485::$$$message_0682_0016_0002$$$::My eyeballs spasm, and the world seems to[lr]::
74486::$$$message_0682_0016_0003$$$::warp and twist around me.[lr]::
74487::$$$message_0682_0016_0004$$$::Every cell in my body screams in warning, and I desperately try to snap myself out of my frozen terror.::
74488::$$$message_0682_0017_0000$$$::But I can't.[lr]::
74489::$$$message_0682_0017_0001$$$::Sakura's presence. It's no longer human. No longer Sakura.[lr]::
74490::$$$message_0682_0017_0002$$$::I haven't been swallowed by this titanic magical energy yet.[lr]::
74491::$$$message_0682_0017_0003$$$::There's only one reason I can't move: [lr]::
74492::$$$message_0682_0017_0004$$$::Sakura's boundless bloodlust is directed at me.::
74493::$$$message_0682_0018_0000$$$::"You've always been like that. You said you would protect me, but you never had eyes only for me.[lr]::
74494::$$$message_0682_0018_0001$$$::It's all right, though. I wanted you because that's the kind of person you are."::
74495::$$$message_0682_0019_0000$$$::    My vision warps.[lr]::
74496::$$$message_0682_0019_0001$$$::My mind is crumbling as I hear the words of this Sakura I don't know.[lr]::
74497::$$$message_0682_0019_0002$$$::It creaks in denial.[lr]::
74498::$$$message_0682_0019_0003$$$::    It protests that this isn't Sakura.[lr]::
74499::$$$message_0682_0019_0004$$$::Forbidden thoughts bury themselves in my mind.::
74500::$$$message_0682_0020_0000$$$::"Is it painful to see me here, Senpai?[lr]::
74501::$$$message_0682_0020_0001$$$::I know how much of a burden I am to you. You'll keep suffering as long as I'm here.[lr]::
74502::$$$message_0682_0020_0002$$$::That's why I needed to disappear in front of you."::
74503::$$$message_0682_0021_0000$$$::Shadows dance.[lr]::
74504::$$$message_0682_0021_0001$$$::The ground of the backyard reminds me of a shadow puppet stage.::
74505::$$$message_0682_0022_0000$$$::"But I can't. You're the only thing that's ever made me happy.[lr]::
74506::$$$message_0682_0022_0001$$$::And you can't stay away from me, either. You can't betray yourself any further."::
74507::$$$message_0682_0023_0000$$$::"...Yes. So I'll kill you, for your own good. That way, we can be together forever...[lr]::
74508::$$$message_0682_0023_0001$$$::And you won't have to suffer anymore."::
74509::$$$message_0682_0024_0000$$$::    The shadows reach for me.[lr]::
74510::$$$message_0682_0024_0001$$$::They swell into a wave bent on swallowing both me and Tohsaka.::
74511::$$$message_0682_0025_0000$$$::In my battered mental state, I shove Tohsaka away.[lr]::
74512::$$$message_0682_0025_0001$$$::The black wave descends on me.[lr]::
74513::$$$message_0682_0025_0002$$$::I don't even try to evade it.[lr]::
74514::$$$message_0682_0025_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74515::$$$message_0682_0025_0004$$$::I was terrified.[lr]::
74516::$$$message_0682_0025_0005$$$::The mere instant I thought that this Sakura isn't Sakura anymore,[lr]::
74517::$$$message_0682_0025_0006$$$::the realization stopped me from moving my body.::
74518::$$$message_0682_0026_0000$$$::...I know this.[lr]::
74519::$$$message_0682_0026_0001$$$::I've bathed in this darkness before.[lr]::
74520::$$$message_0682_0026_0002$$$::It'll shatter me. I couldn't withstand it for even one second last time.[lr]::
74521::$$$message_0682_0026_0003$$$::If it covers me while my mind is still blank, my mind will disappear before my body.::
74522::$$$message_0682_0027_0000$$$::"Guh...ah."::
74523::$$$message_0682_0028_0000$$$::My body withers.[lr]::
74524::$$$message_0682_0028_0001$$$::My body temperature drops to zero in an instant.[lr]::
74525::$$$message_0682_0028_0002$$$::It's more suffocating and scary than I expected, so I move my body to try and get out.[lr]::
74526::$$$message_0682_0028_0003$$$::But I can't jump.[lr]::
74527::$$$message_0682_0028_0004$$$::There's no ground to push off of.[lr]::
74528::$$$message_0682_0028_0005$$$::I'm going to...::
74529::$$$message_0682_0029_0000$$$::"Ah...eh?"[lr]::
74530::$$$message_0682_0029_0001$$$::I come to my senses in the backyard.[lr]::
74531::$$$message_0682_0029_0002$$$::Purple hair fills my field of view.::
74532::$$$message_0682_0030_0000$$$::"Rider, you..."[lr]::
74533::$$$message_0682_0030_0001$$$::"This was your command, Sakura. You told me to protect Shirou Emiya, no matter what."::
74534::$$$message_0682_0031_0000$$$::"Ri...der..."[lr]::
74535::$$$message_0682_0031_0001$$$::Rider rescued me from the black wave.[lr]::
74536::$$$message_0682_0031_0002$$$::"Try not to move. If you stand up in that condition, you will lose consciousness."[lr]::
74537::$$$message_0682_0031_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74538::$$$message_0682_0031_0004$$$::...Um, I'm not even thinking about that.[lr]::
74539::$$$message_0682_0031_0005$$$::On my hands and knees, the act of breathing threatens to knock me out.::
74540::$$$message_0682_0032_0000$$$::"...Oh. So you're going to oppose me, Rider.[lr]::
74541::$$$message_0682_0032_0001$$$::Then I'll take you, too. I ate something I didn't expect earlier, so I don't need any more Servants...[lr]::
74542::$$$message_0682_0032_0002$$$::But I'll do to you what I did to Saber."::
74543::$$$message_0682_0033_0000$$$::...Shadows rise.[lr]::
74544::$$$message_0682_0033_0001$$$::Sakura shrouds the entire yard in darkness. She isn't holding back anymore, after Rider's betrayal.::
74545::$$$message_0682_0034_0000$$$::...The area around us is already covered in black.[lr]::
74546::$$$message_0682_0034_0001$$$::Rider makes no sign of running. She just watches the creeping shadows approach, like a criminal awaiting execution.::
74547::$$$message_0682_0035_0000$$$::"That's enough. You don't need to do all this, Sakura.[lr]::
74548::$$$message_0682_0035_0001$$$::There's no going back if you swallow anything else."::
74549::$$$message_0682_0036_0000$$$::"Illya."[lr]::
74550::$$$message_0682_0036_0001$$$::The shadows' encroachment pauses.::
74551::$$$message_0682_0037_0000$$$::"...What do you mean, Illyasviel?"[lr]::
74552::$$$message_0682_0037_0001$$$::"Exactly what I said. You can consume Rider, kill Shirou, and neutralize Rin, but it's pointless to you right now. You're just wasting time, so why don't you stop the temper tantrum already?"::
74553::$$$message_0682_0038_0000$$$::...What is she doing?[lr]::
74554::$$$message_0682_0038_0001$$$::Illya is walking towards Sakura.::
74555::$$$message_0682_0039_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74556::$$$message_0682_0039_0001$$$::"You're here for me, right? Then let's get this over with. I'll come along peacefully, so leave them alone."::
74557::$$$message_0682_0040_0000$$$::"Are you insane? All I want is your heart.[lr]::
74558::$$$message_0682_0040_0001$$$::You're saying that you don't mind me killing you."[lr]::
74559::$$$message_0682_0040_0002$$$::"I know that. But I'm going to get killed regardless, so it's pointless to resist. For now, you're the strongest one here."::
74560::$$$message_0682_0041_0000$$$::Illya is calm.[lr]::
74561::$$$message_0682_0041_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74562::$$$message_0682_0041_0002$$$::...It's vexing.[lr]::
74563::$$$message_0682_0041_0003$$$::I muster my body and every shred of my frayed mind to try and understand what Illya's saying, but I can't.::
74564::$$$message_0682_0042_0000$$$::"So you're offering yourself up as a sacrifice, Illyasviel?"[lr]::
74565::$$$message_0682_0042_0001$$$::"Yeah. It's my job.[lr]::
74566::$$$message_0682_0042_0002$$$::But my dress isn't here. If you want to open the gate as a successor, you'll need to take me to my castle."[lr]::
74567::$$$message_0682_0042_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
74568::$$$message_0682_0043_0000$$$::"And you've settled your scores, haven't you?[lr]::
74569::$$$message_0682_0043_0001$$$::There's no need to kill Shirou.[lr]::
74570::$$$message_0682_0043_0002$$$::You let that part of you in because you didn't want to kill anyone else, but now you're saying you have to kill them all. You're contradicting yourself, Sakura."[lr]::
74571::$$$message_0682_0043_0003$$$::"Ngh..."::
74572::$$$message_0682_0044_0000$$$::...The shadows recede.[lr]::
74573::$$$message_0682_0044_0001$$$::Even the mud covering Tohsaka fades away as if it was never there.::
74574::$$$message_0682_0045_0000$$$::"...Fine. It saves me the trouble of looking for it myself.[lr]::
74575::$$$message_0682_0045_0001$$$::I don't know what you're playing at, but I'll go along with it."[lr]::
74576::$$$message_0682_0045_0002$$$::Her long hair sways.[lr]::
74577::$$$message_0682_0045_0003$$$::Sakura turns her back on us, as if she's completely lost interest in me and Rider. She starts to leave.::
74578::$$$message_0682_0046_0000$$$::"Sakura...!"[lr]::
74579::$$$message_0682_0046_0001$$$::Still on my knees, I call out to her.[lr]::
74580::$$$message_0682_0046_0002$$$::"..."::
74581::$$$message_0682_0047_0000$$$::"...Don't come to me anymore.[lr]::
74582::$$$message_0682_0047_0001$$$::If I see you in front of me...I'll have to kill you, Senpai."::
74583::$$$message_0682_0048_0000$$$::Sakura grows distant.[lr]::
74584::$$$message_0682_0048_0001$$$::I can't follow her or call out to her.::
74585::$$$message_0682_0049_0000$$$::"Sakura's right. Your role in this is done, Shirou.[lr]::
74586::$$$message_0682_0049_0001$$$::It's my duty to take care of the rest. Sakura's going to take me away, so you can rest now."::
74587::$$$message_0682_0050_0000$$$::I can't even help Illya.::
74588::$$$message_0682_0051_0000$$$::"Bye. It's been fun, big brother."::
74589::$$$message_0682_0052_0000$$$::I hear her bid me a sad farewell.::
74590::$$$message_0682_0053_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74591::$$$message_0682_0053_0001$$$::Finally, I unfreeze.[lr]::
74592::$$$message_0682_0053_0002$$$::My uncontrollable shaking in front of the Shadow,[lr]::
74593::$$$message_0682_0053_0003$$$::and my guilt for thinking Sakura was someone else finally stop.::
74594::$$$message_0682_0054_0000$$$::It's infuriating.[lr]::
74595::$$$message_0682_0054_0001$$$::I was so pathetic that I couldn't even take Sakura's hand.[lr]::
74596::$$$message_0682_0054_0002$$$::And that's not all.[lr]::
74597::$$$message_0682_0054_0003$$$::At the very end, I let Illya make such a face when she called me her big brother!::
74598::$$$message_0682_0055_0000$$$::"YOU DUMBASS!!!"[lr]::
74599::$$$message_0682_0055_0001$$$::I run.[lr]::
74600::$$$message_0682_0055_0002$$$::I chase after them with reckless abandon, pushing through the nausea, the chill, and my soup-like brain.::
74601::$$$message_0682_0056_0000$$$::"Do not follow them. I'll kill you if you go any further."[lr]::
74602::$$$message_0682_0056_0001$$$::"Ngh...!"[lr]::
74603::$$$message_0682_0056_0002$$$::A black-armored Servant stands in my way.[lr]::
74604::$$$message_0682_0056_0003$$$::She's been silent this entire time, and now she overwhelms me with her grim presence, sword pointed at me.::
74605::$$$message_0682_0057_0000$$$::"...Move, Saber. I can't let them leave."[lr]::
74606::$$$message_0682_0057_0001$$$::"And I can't let you go. I will not allow you to follow them... What could you do anyway, even if I did move?"::
