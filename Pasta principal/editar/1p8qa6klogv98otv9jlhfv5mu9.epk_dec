35105::$$$message_0288_0000_0000$$$::"Hup...!"[lr]::
35106::$$$message_0288_0000_0001$$$::Just by instinct, I leap without looking.[lr]::
35107::$$$message_0288_0000_0002$$$::I use Tohsaka's blind spot, the corner of the hallway as a shield, and jump sideways with all my might...!::
35108::$$$message_0288_0001_0000$$$::Just barely, I slide into the hallway.[lr]::
35109::$$$message_0288_0001_0001$$$::"Damn...!"[lr]::
35110::$$$message_0288_0001_0002$$$::I hear her click her tongue irritatingly and something heavy hit the wall.[lr]::
35111::$$$message_0288_0001_0003$$$::"Wait... What did she...!?"[lr]::
35112::$$$message_0288_0001_0004$$$::I look behind me as I stand up.::
35113::$$$message_0288_0002_0000$$$::The wall...[lr]::
35114::$$$message_0288_0002_0001$$$::The wall that was behind me has something sizzling and smoking coming out of it.[lr]::
35115::$$$message_0288_0002_0002$$$::And...[lr]::
35116::$$$message_0288_0002_0003$$$::To be more specific, there are three fist-sized burn marks on the wall.::
35117::$$$message_0288_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
35118::$$$message_0288_0003_0001$$$::A projectile weapon... No, that is a curse that infects the target with illness.::
35119::$$$message_0288_0004_0000$$$::I think the Gandr Shot that Tohsaka was talking about is from Northern European Rune magecraft. It's an indirect curse that can worsen the condition of a person by pointing at them.[lr]::
35120::$$$message_0288_0004_0001$$$::But that should just be a curse that makes a person feel sick. It shouldn't be anything like physically striking something with a projectile.::
35121::$$$message_0288_0005_0000$$$::And yet...Tohsaka's Gandr is so packed full of magical energy, it manifests like a bullet.[lr]::
35122::$$$message_0288_0005_0001$$$::Like, it doesn't just appear similar to a bullet, but strikes like one too...!::
35123::$$$message_0288_0006_0000$$$::Wow, as expected of Tohsaka.[lr]::
35124::$$$message_0288_0006_0001$$$::There's usually a limit to how much force one can use to turn a slow curse into an immediate curse.::
35125::$$$message_0288_0007_0000$$$::"Man, is she trying to kill me...!?"[lr]::
35126::$$$message_0288_0007_0001$$$::"That's what I've been telling you!"[lr]::
35127::$$$message_0288_0007_0002$$$::Her descending footsteps echo behind me.::
35128::$$$message_0288_0008_0000$$$::"Ungh...!"[lr]::
35129::$$$message_0288_0008_0001$$$::I regain my balance and take off at full speed.[lr]::
35130::$$$message_0288_0008_0002$$$::   No time. I have no time. I have to get out of here!::
35131::$$$message_0288_0009_0000$$$::"The hallway. No, the hallway is stupid...!"[lr]::
35132::$$$message_0288_0009_0001$$$::Can't do that. There's no cover.[lr]::
35133::$$$message_0288_0009_0002$$$::Tohsaka's weapon is a projectile, so if I just run down the hallway, it'll just funnel the shots right into my back.::
35134::$$$message_0288_0010_0000$$$::"Don't move...!"[lr]::
35135::$$$message_0288_0010_0001$$$::Tohsaka leaps out from around the corner.[lr]::
35136::$$$message_0288_0010_0002$$$::And just in time, a hair ahead of her...[lr]::
35137::$$$message_0288_0010_0003$$$::I dive into the classroom beside me, room 2-F.::
35138::$$$message_0288_0011_0000$$$::Gandr shots fill the hall.[lr]::
35139::$$$message_0288_0011_0001$$$::It seems like Tohsaka fired the moment she cleared the staircase.::
35140::$$$message_0288_0012_0000$$$::"What a joke, I can't fight something like that...! How can she tell me to fight!? I'm no match for her...!"[lr]::
35141::$$$message_0288_0012_0001$$$::I urgently look around the classroom.[lr]::
35142::$$$message_0288_0012_0002$$$::I need protection.[lr]::
35143::$$$message_0288_0012_0003$$$::Is there some shield or clothes or bulletproof vest that would protect me even if I got shot...!?::
35144::$$$message_0288_0013_0000$$$::"Crap, she's here...!"[lr]::
35145::$$$message_0288_0013_0001$$$::Tohsaka's footsteps stop at the entrance of the classroom.[lr]::
35146::$$$message_0288_0013_0002$$$::...I'm sure she saw me run in here.[lr]::
35147::$$$message_0288_0013_0003$$$::Maybe she's wary of a counterattack so she froze just outside...::
35148::$$$message_0288_0014_0000$$$::"Yeah right, idiot...!"[lr]::
35149::$$$message_0288_0014_0001$$$::I run.[lr]::
35150::$$$message_0288_0014_0002$$$::As I dart from one side of the classroom to the other, sprinting towards the exit up front...[lr]::
35151::$$$message_0288_0014_0003$$$::A hail of bullets mercilessly fly through the air!::
35152::$$$message_0288_0015_0000$$$::Oh god, she's shooting like crazy...![lr]::
35153::$$$message_0288_0015_0001$$$::The bullets penetrate the wall, shooting radially inside the classroom.::
35154::$$$message_0288_0016_0000$$$::"Ugh...! One must've grazed my back!"[lr]::
35155::$$$message_0288_0016_0001$$$::If I hesitated for a moment longer I'd have been hit center mass.::
35156::$$$message_0288_0017_0000$$$::"Ungh!? No way, how are you still standing!?"[lr]::
35157::$$$message_0288_0017_0001$$$::Rin Tohsaka springs into the classroom.[lr]::
35158::$$$message_0288_0017_0002$$$::There are about four meters between us, as we stand at both entrances in the front and the back of the classroom. We glare at each other again... But I have to...!::
35159::$$$message_0288_0018_0000$$$::I jump out to the hallway.[lr]::
35160::$$$message_0288_0018_0001$$$::Escaping through the classroom is not an option.[lr]::
35161::$$$message_0288_0018_0002$$$::At this point, I can only sprint towards the stairs!::
35162::$$$message_0288_0019_0000$$$::"Ngh!"[lr]::
35163::$$$message_0288_0019_0001$$$::Man, she really is merciless![lr]::
35164::$$$message_0288_0019_0002$$$::I think it scraped my temple just now! My side...! My side too!::
35165::$$$message_0288_0020_0000$$$::"Ow, owwww! Damn, are you serious!? That's going to screw me right over if I get hit by that!"[lr]::
35166::$$$message_0288_0020_0001$$$::"That's the point, you jackass![lr]::
35167::$$$message_0288_0020_0002$$$::If you don't want to get hurt, stop and I'll make it nice and quick!"::
35168::$$$message_0288_0021_0000$$$::The bullets fly through the air.[lr]::
35169::$$$message_0288_0021_0001$$$::And just why does it sound even more like actual bullets now!?::
35170::$$$message_0288_0022_0000$$$::"Hold on, aren't you shooting Gandr!?[lr]::
35171::$$$message_0288_0022_0001$$$::That sounds more like a freaking gun that'll kill me!"::
35172::$$$message_0288_0023_0000$$$::"Shut up! Then don't run away! It's your fault I have to focus my fire! A moving target's harder!"::
35173::$$$message_0288_0023_0001$$$::The gunshots echo even louder.[lr]::
35174::$$$message_0288_0023_0002$$$::But in the nick of time...[lr]::
35175::$$$message_0288_0023_0003$$$::I barely make it to the stairs by the 2-A classroom.::
35176::$$$message_0288_0024_0000$$$::"Ha... Haah, haah, ha...!"[lr]::
35177::$$$message_0288_0024_0001$$$::I run down the stairs.[lr]::
35178::$$$message_0288_0024_0002$$$::Making it this far brings me closer to victory.[lr]::
35179::$$$message_0288_0024_0003$$$::I reach the landing to the second story.[lr]::
35180::$$$message_0288_0024_0004$$$::If I can get to the first floor, even Tohsaka won't go through the trouble to follow me...::
35181::$$$message_0288_0025_0000$$$::   I'm speechless.[lr]::
35182::$$$message_0288_0025_0001$$$::Tohsaka took a shortcut by jumping over the stairway handrail.::
35183::$$$message_0288_0026_0000$$$::By which I mean...[lr]::
35184::$$$message_0288_0026_0001$$$::In order to get down to the first floor from these stairs, I now have Tohsaka barring the way in front of me. She smiles confidently.::
35185::$$$message_0288_0027_0000$$$::"...I'm surprised. You're pretty agile. Even though you were saying you had some extra weight before."[lr]::
35186::$$$message_0288_0027_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
35187::$$$message_0288_0027_0002$$$::Ah.[lr]::
35188::$$$message_0288_0027_0003$$$::Yeah, I think I can see a vein pop on her forehead.::
35189::$$$message_0288_0028_0000$$$::It's scary how I'm getting used to this.[lr]::
35190::$$$message_0288_0028_0001$$$::The instant I realize it's coming, my legs send me jumping sideways as I hear the sound of bullets hitting the wall.::
35191::$$$message_0288_0029_0000$$$::I flee in the opposite direction.[lr]::
35192::$$$message_0288_0029_0001$$$::The good news is I'm down to the second floor hallway.[lr]::
35193::$$$message_0288_0029_0002$$$::If I'm able to make good time, I can get to the first floor, where I'm sure even Tohsaka won't[line2]::
35194::$$$message_0288_0030_0000$$$::"Really, still? You're persistent, Tohsaka! Give it up already!"[lr]::
35195::$$$message_0288_0030_0001$$$::"You also don't know when to give up...! I won't kill you, so give it up already...!"::
35196::$$$message_0288_0031_0000$$$::   I don't know if it's because she's seriously serious, or because she's just lost it from the goose chase I've given her...[lr]::
35197::$$$message_0288_0031_0001$$$::But if Tohsaka's shots get any louder, someone's gonna call the cops on us for sure.::
35198::$$$message_0288_0031_0002$$$::"Eek...![lr]::
35199::$$$message_0288_0031_0003$$$::I really gotta stop worrying about stuff like that...!"[lr]::
35200::$$$message_0288_0031_0004$$$::With the power increase comes bigger bullets, too.[lr]::
35201::$$$message_0288_0031_0005$$$::The near misses from this so-called curse felt hot before, but now they're torching everything in their path.::
35202::$$$message_0288_0032_0000$$$::"Ow...!"[lr]::
35203::$$$message_0288_0032_0001$$$::One Gandr just faintly scrapes my leg.[lr]::
35204::$$$message_0288_0032_0002$$$::   My speed drops immediately.[lr]::
35205::$$$message_0288_0032_0003$$$::The instant I know she'll catch up to me before I make it to the stairs, I fling myself into the nearest classroom.::
35206::$$$message_0288_0033_0000$$$::"Ungh..."[lr]::
35207::$$$message_0288_0033_0001$$$::Inside, I make for a window.[lr]::
35208::$$$message_0288_0033_0002$$$::So now...[lr]::
35209::$$$message_0288_0033_0003$$$::I should be able to manage a jump out from this second story window.[lr]::
35210::$$$message_0288_0033_0004$$$::I'll get shot if I go back into the hall, so this looks like the better choice.::
35211::$$$message_0288_0034_0000$$$::"...Das Schließung (Prepare). Vogelkäfig, Echo (Soundproof, Termination)."[lr]::
35212::$$$message_0288_0034_0001$$$::I hear Tohsaka's voice in the hallway.[lr]::
35213::$$$message_0288_0034_0002$$$::Something like a thin membrane envelops the classroom.::
35214::$$$message_0288_0035_0000$$$::"...A Bounded Field...?"[lr]::
35215::$$$message_0288_0035_0001$$$::The moment I realize that it is a Bounded Field with some sort of soundproofing effect, I know exactly what she's going to do.::
35216::$$$message_0288_0036_0000$$$::"Agh!!!"[lr]::
35217::$$$message_0288_0036_0001$$$::I dive toward the wall by the windows.::
35218::$$$message_0288_0037_0000$$$::    I can feel a strong magecraft being activated.::
35219::$$$message_0288_0038_0000$$$::Quickly, I upend a desk and crouch behind it.::
35220::$$$message_0288_0039_0000$$$::    This isn't like the Gandr she's fired until now.::
35221::$$$message_0288_0040_0000$$$::I close my eyes and place my hand on the underside of the desk.::
35222::$$$message_0288_0041_0000$$$::    She's making an incantation.[lr]::
35223::$$$message_0288_0041_0001$$$::Even though she has the help from her Magic Crest, Tohsaka is chanting a spell.::
35224::$$$message_0288_0042_0000$$$::Will I make it? No, I have to make it.[lr]::
35225::$$$message_0288_0042_0001$$$::I skip all stages of the process of creating a second set of nerves in my spine, and pour as much magical energy as possible into the desk...! ::
35226::$$$message_0288_0043_0000$$$::"Fixierung (Aim), Eile Salve (Volley Fire)...!"::
35227::$$$message_0288_0044_0000$$$::"Trace, on!"::
35228::$$$message_0288_0045_0000$$$::Light and sound explode.[lr]::
35229::$$$message_0288_0045_0001$$$::It's an ordinary day after school, and this mundane, everyday classroom is suddenly a dance floor.::
35230::$$$message_0288_0046_0000$$$::    The desks dance.[lr]::
35231::$$$message_0288_0046_0001$$$::The magical energy being released here is nothing like the pistol fire from before.[lr]::
35232::$$$message_0288_0046_0002$$$::This is more like a machine gun in terms of coverage and speed.::
35233::$$$message_0288_0047_0000$$$::I don't know exactly what effect this curse filled with magical energy has, but it's strong enough to be visible to the human eye.[lr]::
35234::$$$message_0288_0047_0001$$$::As it has mass, it destroys everything it touches.[lr]::
35235::$$$message_0288_0047_0002$$$::The desks that are lined up in the classroom go wild like a person set ablaze.[lr]::
35236::$$$message_0288_0047_0003$$$::My eardrums are already screwed from the sounds of the dancing desks and the echoing bullets.::
35237::$$$message_0288_0048_0000$$$::A battlefield might actually be a more apt description.[lr]::
35238::$$$message_0288_0048_0001$$$::Despite that, there is not a single crack in the windows.[lr]::
35239::$$$message_0288_0048_0002$$$::It must be the power of the Bounded Field that Tohsaka put up.[lr]::
35240::$$$message_0288_0048_0003$$$::Right now, this classroom is an enclosed space.[lr]::
35241::$$$message_0288_0048_0004$$$::Even if one can enter, they can't leave.::
35242::$$$message_0288_0049_0000$$$::The dozens of bullets fired in here are no exception, and even these loud sounds don't escape this room.[lr]::
35243::$$$message_0288_0049_0001$$$::...Damn.[lr]::
35244::$$$message_0288_0049_0002$$$::Even when she looks like she's going apeshit, Tohsaka is a calculating mage through and through!::
35245::$$$message_0288_0050_0000$$$::"Ungh...!"[lr]::
35246::$$$message_0288_0050_0001$$$::I put as much energy as I can produce into my makeshift shield.[lr]::
35247::$$$message_0288_0050_0002$$$::The desk is under the effects of Strengthening[line2]the one kind of magecraft I'm any good at[line2]giving me a defense against this magical rain.::
35248::$$$message_0288_0051_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
35249::$$$message_0288_0051_0001$$$::But, that's only for a brief moment.[lr]::
35250::$$$message_0288_0051_0002$$$::My Strengthening can only endure three seconds from the rain of bullets.[lr]::
35251::$$$message_0288_0051_0003$$$::As a result, I redo the spell the instant that it wears off and have to repeat this for as long as my magical energy lasts, but...::
35252::$$$message_0288_0052_0000$$$::"Damn, does she have infinite energy...!?"::
35253::$$$message_0288_0053_0000$$$::The rain does not stop.[lr]::
35254::$$$message_0288_0053_0001$$$::...Maybe Tohsaka knows what's going on in this classroom.[lr]::
35255::$$$message_0288_0053_0002$$$::She might still be attacking since she knows that I'm still blocking her attacks like this.[lr]::
35256::$$$message_0288_0053_0003$$$::In that case, this rain would stop when...::
35257::$$$message_0288_0054_0000$$$::"...When my magical energy runs out, huh...?"[lr]::
35258::$$$message_0288_0054_0001$$$::While focusing my energy on the desk, I slump my shoulders.[lr]::
35259::$$$message_0288_0054_0002$$$::...Then let's compare our stamina.[lr]::
35260::$$$message_0288_0054_0003$$$::We'll just have to see who concedes first!::
35261::$$$message_0288_0055_0000$$$::"...Ugh, even so..."[lr]::
35262::$$$message_0288_0055_0001$$$::It's like the match has already been decided.[lr]::
35263::$$$message_0288_0055_0002$$$::I feel like I got KO'd fifteen seconds into the first round.[lr]::
35264::$$$message_0288_0055_0003$$$::I'm not wounded and I've still got stamina to spare. But I'm stuck and can't do anything if I run out of magical energy.::
35265::$$$message_0288_0056_0000$$$::"...And, man."[lr]::
35266::$$$message_0288_0056_0001$$$::I peek from behind the desk.[lr]::
35267::$$$message_0288_0056_0002$$$::The smoke filling the classroom makes everything hazy.[lr]::
35268::$$$message_0288_0056_0003$$$::I hear a clanging sound.[lr]::
35269::$$$message_0288_0056_0004$$$::My hand bumps into some kind of rod on the floor. ::
35270::$$$message_0288_0056_0005$$$::"A chair leg, huh... She really destroyed this place."[lr]::
35271::$$$message_0288_0056_0006$$$::Well, I guess it can be used as a makeshift weapon.[lr]::
35272::$$$message_0288_0056_0007$$$::The rod is about twenty centimeters long. I take hold and pour what remaining magical energy I can into it.::
35273::$$$message_0288_0056_0008$$$::"...It worked. Guess I never miss when it's the real thing."::
35274::$$$message_0288_0057_0000$$$::I try a practice swing with the Strengthened club.[lr]::
35275::$$$message_0288_0057_0001$$$::...Well.[lr]::
35276::$$$message_0288_0057_0002$$$::Things won't get better if I just sit here. I'll just be full of holes if she attacks again.[lr]::
35277::$$$message_0288_0057_0003$$$::Maybe I used too much magical energy, as I can't even stand.::
35278::$$$message_0288_0058_0000$$$::"Hrrk... Gah, kah..."[lr]::
35279::$$$message_0288_0058_0001$$$::And I can't even breathe in this smoke.::
35280::$$$message_0288_0059_0000$$$::"Smoking me out, huh? She's got it all planned out."[lr]::
35281::$$$message_0288_0059_0001$$$::Tohsaka is experienced in fighting.[lr]::
35282::$$$message_0288_0059_0002$$$::She'll just corner me if I stay here.[lr]::
35283::$$$message_0288_0059_0003$$$::...I'm sure she's waiting for me in the hallway, but I can't escape from the window because of that weird Bounded Field.::
35284::$$$message_0288_0060_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
35285::$$$message_0288_0060_0001$$$::I make up my mind and go to the hallway.[lr]::
35286::$$$message_0288_0060_0002$$$::With the numbness of my feet still there, I push past the wreckage of desks, and I crawl forward into the white smoke before me.[lr]::
35287::$$$message_0288_0060_0003$$$::Then beyond the scorched ruins...::
35288::$$$message_0288_0061_0000$$$::"...Heh. You finally came out, Emiya."[lr]::
35289::$$$message_0288_0061_0001$$$::Tohsaka is waiting for me, with her shoulders heaving.::
35290::$$$message_0288_0062_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
35291::$$$message_0288_0062_0001$$$::I glare at her and manage to pull myself up.[lr]::
35292::$$$message_0288_0062_0002$$$::Guess the numbness is temporary and I can move my legs if I really try.::
35293::$$$message_0288_0063_0000$$$::Not that mobility will be enough.[lr]::
35294::$$$message_0288_0063_0001$$$::Tohsaka is only winded from all the running around. She's got plenty of magical energy to spare.[lr]::
35295::$$$message_0288_0063_0002$$$::I've got no magical energy left. She's just a bit low on stamina.[lr]::
35296::$$$message_0288_0063_0003$$$::The moment we resume this battle, I'm gonna be shot down for sure.::
35297::$$$message_0288_0064_0000$$$::"It's over. Come on, throw away that silly weapon. You don't have a chance at winning."[lr]::
35298::$$$message_0288_0064_0001$$$::Rin Tohsaka gloats over her victory.::
35299::$$$message_0288_0065_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
35300::$$$message_0288_0065_0001$$$::That pisses me off.[lr]::
35301::$$$message_0288_0065_0002$$$::Honestly, I know I have no chance in hell, but I can't help but feel insulted.::
35302::$$$message_0288_0066_0000$$$::"...Well, you never know. And I don't think you have any room to say that while huffing and puffing like an asthmatic, stupid."[lr]::
35303::$$$message_0288_0066_0001$$$::I point the leg of the chair at Tohsaka as a sign that I'm gonna go down swinging.::
35304::$$$message_0288_0067_0000$$$::"...Mm, I see.[lr]::
35305::$$$message_0288_0067_0001$$$::Fine, I was going to be nice if you were going to give up, but it seems like that's casting pearls before swine. So let me apologize in advance, Emiya."[lr]::
35306::$$$message_0288_0067_0002$$$::She grins.[lr]::
35307::$$$message_0288_0067_0003$$$::I wish she wouldn't make such an ominous smile.::
35308::$$$message_0288_0068_0000$$$::"Huh? Apologize for what? Even if you apologize now, I'm not going to forgive you for this."::
35309::$$$message_0288_0069_0000$$$::"I'm apologizing for what's about to happen, Emiya.[lr]::
35310::$$$message_0288_0069_0001$$$::I can't hold back if you resist, right? If I accidentally kill you, it'll be too late to offer any apologies then, you know."::
35311::$$$message_0288_0070_0000$$$::"Ungh...!"[lr]::
35312::$$$message_0288_0070_0001$$$::Shit, she's serious...![lr]::
35313::$$$message_0288_0070_0002$$$::Er, not that she hasn't been serious up to now, but this seems like she's had her last breaker flipped. I now realize I'm truly just a sitting duck, and earlier she was just getting her ducks in a row...::
35314::$$$message_0288_0071_0000$$$::"Oh, you finally understand? Good, if you said something brainless I'd have had to really do something about it."[lr]::
35315::$$$message_0288_0071_0001$$$::"Ugh... What do you mean by 'something'?"::
35316::$$$message_0288_0072_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
35317::$$$message_0288_0072_0001$$$::She glares at me.[lr]::
35318::$$$message_0288_0072_0002$$$::...Er, okay.[lr]::
35319::$$$message_0288_0072_0003$$$::Something brainless like that, yeah, I got it.::
35320::$$$message_0288_0073_0000$$$::"...This is your final warning.[lr]::
35321::$$$message_0288_0073_0001$$$::Throw away that silly weapon of yours and give me your Command Spells. Worst case scenario, it'll rip off your arm's nerves, but that's better than losing your life, right?"::
35322::$$$message_0288_0074_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
35323::$$$message_0288_0074_0001$$$::Give up my Command Spells?[lr]::
35324::$$$message_0288_0074_0002$$$::Those aren't something I can afford to give, and most of all...::
35325::$$$message_0288_0075_0000$$$::"...No. I can't do that."[lr]::
35326::$$$message_0288_0075_0001$$$::"...I see. Let me ask: Why?"::
35327::$$$message_0288_0076_0000$$$::"If I were to give you my Command Spells, that'd be the same as betraying Saber."[lr]::
35328::$$$message_0288_0076_0001$$$::"...All right. I'll give you three seconds. It's your life, so you decide."::
35329::$$$message_0288_0077_0000$$$::Tohsaka raises her left arm.[lr]::
35330::$$$message_0288_0077_0001$$$::I bet she'll fire a Gandr the moment I refuse.[lr]::
35331::$$$message_0288_0077_0002$$$::I...[lr]::
