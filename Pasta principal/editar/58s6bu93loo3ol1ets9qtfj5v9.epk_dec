58178::$$$message_0521_0000_0000$$$::This is just common sense, of course, but[lr]::
58179::$$$message_0521_0000_0001$$$::once dinner is over, all that's left is to take a bath and go to bed.[lr]::
58180::$$$message_0521_0000_0002$$$::There's no problem at all.[lr]::
58181::$$$message_0521_0000_0003$$$::Really, it's totally normal. Nothing out of the ordinary about it.::
58182::$$$message_0521_0001_0000$$$::                                                      However...::
58183::$$$message_0521_0002_0000$$$::"Um...Ms. Fujimura, I'd like to ask you something."[lr]::
58184::$$$message_0521_0002_0001$$$::"Hm? What's up?"[lr]::
58185::$$$message_0521_0002_0002$$$::"Well, um...you know..."::
58186::$$$message_0521_0003_0000$$$::"Oh, right. You need a change of clothes. Hmm...I have school uniforms at home, and I can give you some of my regular clothes, too. Oh, or do you want to go home and get clothes?"[lr]::
58187::$$$message_0521_0003_0001$$$::"...No, I think if I went, I wouldn't be able to come back. I'd rather not go home. My brother is, um..."::
58188::$$$message_0521_0004_0000$$$::"Mm, don't worry about that. I just called your house and got permission from your grandfather. He said that he could rest easy knowing you're at your teacher's house, and thanked me for teaching you."[lr]::
58189::$$$message_0521_0004_0001$$$::"O-oh, he did? Then, I can really stay over!?"[lr]::
58190::$$$message_0521_0004_0002$$$::"Yup. So, about the clothes, you can use my pajamas. Hopefully you're okay with my underwear, too?"::
58191::$$$message_0521_0005_0000$$$::"Ah... Um, yours might be...tight around the chest..."[lr]::
58192::$$$message_0521_0005_0001$$$::"Mrgh. Oh, riiight. You've got a big bust.[lr]::
58193::$$$message_0521_0005_0002$$$::...Gimme some of that."[lr]::
58194::$$$message_0521_0005_0003$$$::"Kyaaah! W-what do you think you're doing!?"[lr]::
58195::$$$message_0521_0005_0004$$$::"Ahahahahaha! Just kidding! ...But that is a problem. I don't have any bras in your size. Do you wear them to sleep?"::
58196::$$$message_0521_0006_0000$$$::"Er...well, yes."[lr]::
58197::$$$message_0521_0006_0001$$$::"Figures. A lot of bigger women do that. I bet it's uncomfortable, though! ...She says, all insensitive."[lr]::
58198::$$$message_0521_0006_0002$$$::"...I-it is uncomfortable, but when that happens..."::
58199::$$$message_0521_0007_0000$$$::"Aha, I see! Sure is nice to be young! Anyway, I'll gather up my younger-looking clothes by tomorrow morning. On that note, have a nice bath!"[lr]::
58200::$$$message_0521_0007_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
58201::$$$message_0521_0008_0000$$$::"...Ngh."[lr]::
58202::$$$message_0521_0008_0001$$$::Y-you didn't need to have that conversation in front of me, stupid Fuji-nee![lr]::
58203::$$$message_0521_0008_0002$$$::I'm a man! I'm trying not to think about it, but if you talk about it here, I'll be extra conscious, and I won't be able to look at Sakura the same way!::
58204::$$$message_0521_0009_0000$$$::"Ohhh? What's wrong, Shirou? You're all red. Are you curious about what we were talking about?"[lr]::
58205::$$$message_0521_0009_0001$$$::"...! H-hmph! I don't know what you're talking about! It was private, right? I didn't hear anything, and I don't care."::
58206::$$$message_0521_0010_0000$$$::"Oh, okay. Then I'll share something interesting with you. Sakura's an 85E. Amazing, right? She's actually 13 centimeters bigger than last year.[lr]::
58207::$$$message_0521_0010_0001$$$::I bet you've noticed, Shirou. How soft she looks lately, and how [font italic=true]huggable[font italic=false] she is..."::
58208::$$$message_0521_0011_0000$$$::"You[line2]!"[lr]::
58209::$$$message_0521_0011_0001$$$::"M-Ms. Fujimura![lr]::
58210::$$$message_0521_0011_0002$$$::What are you saying!?"[lr]::
58211::$$$message_0521_0011_0003$$$::"Eh? Huh? Oh, noooooo~"[lr]::
58212::$$$message_0521_0012_0000$$$::Sakura counterattacks, taking Fuji-nee to the ground.[lr]::
58213::$$$message_0521_0012_0001$$$::She's blushing bright red and furiously trying to cover Fuji-nee's mouth.::
58214::$$$message_0521_0013_0000$$$::Sakura...[lr]::
58215::$$$message_0521_0013_0001$$$::I understand why you'd want to silence Fuji-nee, but don't silence her basic life functions, too.::
58216::$$$message_0521_0014_0000$$$::"Hah, hah, hah... Ahh, that surprised me, Sakura. You're more of a fighter than you look. I can't believe you just tried to suffocate your teacher."[lr]::
58217::$$$message_0521_0014_0001$$$::"I can't imagine what you mean! I think you should act a little more sorry, Ms. Fujimura!"[lr]::
58218::$$$message_0521_0014_0002$$$::Sakura turns away from Fuji-nee sulkily.[lr]::
58219::$$$message_0521_0014_0003$$$::    Then...[lr]::
58220::$$$message_0521_0014_0004$$$::We end up making eye contact with each other.::
58221::$$$message_0521_0015_0000$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
58222::$$$message_0521_0015_0001$$$::"Oh, uh...the bath towels are in the bathroom."[lr]::
58223::$$$message_0521_0015_0002$$$::"R-right! Off I go then, Senpai...!"::
58224::$$$message_0521_0016_0000$$$::Sakura hurriedly turns to leave the living room.[lr]::
58225::$$$message_0521_0016_0001$$$::"Hey[line2]"[lr]::
58226::$$$message_0521_0016_0002$$$::And, once again...[lr]::
58227::$$$message_0521_0016_0003$$$::"Ow... I bumped my nose..."[lr]::
58228::$$$message_0521_0016_0004$$$::I was about to warn her to watch her step.[lr]::
58229::$$$message_0521_0016_0005$$$::Before I could, however, she ran smack dab into a pillar.::
58230::$$$message_0521_0017_0000$$$::"Sakura, are you okay!?"[lr]::
58231::$$$message_0521_0017_0001$$$::Was she panicking so bad she ran into a pillar before she even made it to the hallway?[lr]::
58232::$$$message_0521_0017_0002$$$::"Yes, I'm fine... I'm okay, so I'll go take a bath nowww..."[lr]::
58233::$$$message_0521_0017_0003$$$::Sakura disappears down the hall, her steps wavering.::
58234::$$$message_0521_0018_0000$$$::"Whew."[lr]::
58235::$$$message_0521_0018_0001$$$::I can finally breathe now that Sakura's in the bath.[lr]::
58236::$$$message_0521_0018_0002$$$::If that tension had gone on much longer, I might've been the one to flee the living room.::
58237::$$$message_0521_0019_0000$$$::"Hmmm?"[lr]::
58238::$$$message_0521_0019_0001$$$::"What now? If you have something to say, say it, you delinquent teacher."::
58239::$$$message_0521_0020_0000$$$::"Oh, nothing in particular. I was just thinking that Sakura's going to have a hard time too. You were kinda cute, getting all red and flustered.[lr]::
58240::$$$message_0521_0020_0001$$$::Maybe it makes Sakura embarrassed to see you like that, too."::
58241::$$$message_0521_0021_0000$$$::"I wasn't r-red! Sakura is like family to me, you know! She's my kouhai who always cooks and eats with us! I wouldn't embarrass myself in front of her like that!"::
58242::$$$message_0521_0022_0000$$$::"Uh-huh. So you don't want to embarrass yourself, hmm?"[lr]::
58243::$$$message_0521_0022_0001$$$::"Of course not! She's Shinji's sister. I gotta take good care of my friend's sister."::
58244::$$$message_0521_0023_0000$$$::"Huh? Oh, that's what you meant? I never thought you paid attention to that, but you actually care."[lr]::
58245::$$$message_0521_0023_0001$$$::Fuji-nee heaves an exaggerated sigh.[lr]::
58246::$$$message_0521_0023_0002$$$::This is...very unpleasant.::
58247::$$$message_0521_0024_0000$$$::"I see many challenges on the horizon for you both."[lr]::
58248::$$$message_0521_0024_0001$$$::"Mm? Where are you going?"[lr]::
58249::$$$message_0521_0024_0002$$$::"To the changing room. I need to pick out some clothes for Sakura. Shirou, go get the guest bedroom ready for her. I'll bring some new sheets."[lr]::
58250::$$$message_0521_0024_0003$$$::Fuji-nee just says whatever she wants and leaves me in the living room.::
58251::$$$message_0521_0025_0000$$$::"...Hmph. Saber, I'm going to make up the guestroom, so wait here."[lr]::
58252::$$$message_0521_0025_0001$$$::Saber nods wordlessly, and I leave the living room.::
58253::$$$message_0521_0026_0000$$$::I make the bed and check the guestroom furnishings.[lr]::
58254::$$$message_0521_0026_0001$$$::It's a different room from the one we initially set Saber up in, one that hasn't been used in a long time.[lr]::
58255::$$$message_0521_0026_0002$$$::This one's better for Sakura, and it has a lock on the door.[lr]::
58256::$$$message_0521_0026_0003$$$::Sakura's...well, a girl, so I figure she'll feel more comfortable if she can lock her door.::
58257::$$$message_0521_0027_0000$$$::"...Not like I let Fuji-nee get to my head, or anything."[lr]::
58258::$$$message_0521_0027_0001$$$::I lay the sheets out and pat them flat.[lr]::
58259::$$$message_0521_0027_0002$$$::This bed has never been used.[lr]::
58260::$$$message_0521_0027_0003$$$::As soon as I start thinking that Sakura's going to sleep on it tonight...[lr]::
58261::$$$message_0521_0027_0004$$$::"I [font italic=true]bet[font italic=false] you've noticed, Shirou."[lr]::
58262::$$$message_0521_0027_0005$$$::"Ergh."[lr]::
58263::$$$message_0521_0027_0006$$$::Awful thoughts fill my mind.::
58264::$$$message_0521_0028_0000$$$::"Th-that's stupid. After all this time, why would I..."[lr]::
58265::$$$message_0521_0028_0001$$$::...But that goes without saying.[lr]::
58266::$$$message_0521_0028_0002$$$::I've watched from right next to her as Sakura's grown more and more beautiful.[lr]::
58267::$$$message_0521_0028_0003$$$::I'm happy for her, and I've been telling myself not to be conscious of it.[lr]::
58268::$$$message_0521_0028_0004$$$::Sakura is Shinji's little sister, and she helps me out of a sense of guilt over the way her brother behaves.::
58269::$$$message_0521_0029_0000$$$::"...It's already been a year and a half. It's not like I see her that way."[lr]::
58270::$$$message_0521_0029_0001$$$::It all started with the accident that caused me to leave the kyudo club.[lr]::
58271::$$$message_0521_0029_0002$$$::I hurt my shoulder at work, and there was some talk about the burn scars being an issue, so I figured it was a good time as any to quit the club.[lr]::
58272::$$$message_0521_0029_0003$$$::...After that, I think it was Sakura who volunteered to start helping me out at home until my injuries healed.::
58273::$$$message_0521_0030_0000$$$::She still looked younger back then, and struck me as a hard worker.[lr]::
58274::$$$message_0521_0030_0001$$$::The first day, she waited in front of my house for me to come home, then stood there sullenly face to face for a while, until she finally said she wanted to help me. I think she was out there for two hours.::
58275::$$$message_0521_0031_0000$$$::"And now, that introvert's the rising star of the kyudo club. People sure can change."::
58276::$$$message_0521_0032_0000$$$::Sakura's demeanor has brightened a lot, actually.[lr]::
58277::$$$message_0521_0032_0001$$$::I first met her four years ago through Shinji, I think, when I went over to his house to play.::
58278::$$$message_0521_0033_0000$$$::She was silent, and she had a habit of letting her hair cover her face.[lr]::
58279::$$$message_0521_0033_0001$$$::...She still has that part of her, but Sakura back then looked positively downtrodden. She always had a glum look on her face, and would just stand around absently.[lr]::
58280::$$$message_0521_0033_0002$$$::When I compare Sakura now to back then, I truly do feel happy for her.[lr]::
58281::$$$message_0521_0033_0003$$$::I'm relieved that the depressed girl who was always staring at the ground is now someone who can laugh like she's genuinely enjoying life.::
58282::$$$message_0521_0034_0000$$$::"Don't you think about it sometimes? How soft and huggable she looks..."::
58283::$$$message_0521_0035_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58284::$$$message_0521_0035_0001$$$::...I don't really know, myself.[lr]::
58285::$$$message_0521_0035_0002$$$::At the very least, I only saw Sakura as my kouhai until recently.[lr]::
58286::$$$message_0521_0035_0003$$$::That image of her only started to crumble recently.[lr]::
58287::$$$message_0521_0035_0004$$$::...When did it start, exactly? Maybe it happened long before I realized.[lr]::
58288::$$$message_0521_0035_0005$$$::   Or maybe...[lr]::
58289::$$$message_0521_0035_0006$$$::We're so close that I never needed to notice.::
58290::$$$message_0521_0036_0000$$$::"Damn it. Everything was going fine, so why..."[lr]::
58291::$$$message_0521_0036_0001$$$::Why does the thought of Sakura sleeping over make my heart pound like this?[lr]::
58292::$$$message_0521_0036_0002$$$::It's rude to Sakura.[lr]::
58293::$$$message_0521_0036_0003$$$::I should hurry up and finish cleaning the room. Then I can let Sakura stay here.::
58294::$$$message_0521_0037_0000$$$::"Huh? Saber, where's Sakura?"[lr]::
58295::$$$message_0521_0037_0001$$$::"I don't know. She didn't come back here, so shouldn't she still be in the bath?"[lr]::
58296::$$$message_0521_0037_0002$$$::"...? But it's already been an hour."::
58297::$$$message_0521_0038_0000$$$::Maybe Sakura takes long baths.[lr]::
58298::$$$message_0521_0038_0001$$$::She has to wash a lot of parts that I don't, so a quick shower might not be...::
58299::$$$message_0521_0039_0000$$$::"Aaaargh stop, stop! Don't imagine it!"[lr]::
58300::$$$message_0521_0039_0001$$$::I shake my head and sit down at the table.[lr]::
58301::$$$message_0521_0039_0002$$$::Then, I brew some tea, and let the fragrant liquid soothe my throat.::
58302::$$$message_0521_0040_0000$$$::"Whew..."[lr]::
58303::$$$message_0521_0040_0001$$$::I purge myself of my fantasies and breathe deep.[lr]::
58304::$$$message_0521_0040_0002$$$::Then...[lr]::
58305::$$$message_0521_0040_0003$$$::"Shirou. Does Sakura have poor eyesight?"[lr]::
58306::$$$message_0521_0040_0004$$$::What an odd question.::
58307::$$$message_0521_0041_0000$$$::"? No, not really. Sakura has good vision.[lr]::
58308::$$$message_0521_0041_0001$$$::I think she's 1.5 across both eyes."[lr]::
58309::$$$message_0521_0041_0002$$$::"I see. I've noticed her running into walls and pillars frequently, so I presumed there might be some problem with her vision."::
58310::$$$message_0521_0042_0000$$$::"Oh, that. Well, I appreciate the concern, but Sakura's healthy. She's just a little clumsy lately because she's tired, but she's normally got her head on straighter than I do."::
58311::$$$message_0521_0043_0000$$$::"That's good to hear...but even so, if she is so tired she's running into walls, that is a problem. This is just my opinion, but I felt that her accident earlier was not due to fatigue, but because she misjudged where the pillar was."::
58312::$$$message_0521_0044_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58313::$$$message_0521_0044_0001$$$::Saber's opinion makes sense.[lr]::
58314::$$$message_0521_0044_0002$$$::No matter how tired you are, you don't just start randomly walking into walls.::
58315::$$$message_0521_0045_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
58316::$$$message_0521_0045_0001$$$::Speaking of Sakura, where is she?[lr]::
58317::$$$message_0521_0045_0002$$$::If she's really in the bath, one hour is a pretty long time.[lr]::
58318::$$$message_0521_0045_0003$$$::Right now...[lr]::
