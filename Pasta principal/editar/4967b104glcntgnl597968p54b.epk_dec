71904::$$$message_0661_0000_0000$$$::Nobody comes out to greet us.[lr]::
71905::$$$message_0661_0000_0001$$$::Ryudou Temple looms over us like a giant hunched in the darkness. I feel some strange power from it.[lr]::
71906::$$$message_0661_0000_0002$$$::Is the wind blowing, up in the sky?[lr]::
71907::$$$message_0661_0000_0003$$$::I crane my neck to listen, and hear howling wind.::
71908::$$$message_0661_0001_0000$$$::"...I sense power from the top of the stairs. They seem to be building something at the pond beyond the temple grounds."[lr]::
71909::$$$message_0661_0001_0001$$$::"No, we're not going to the temple. The compound up top was built just for show, for the benefit of Masters seeking the Holy Grail."[lr]::
71910::$$$message_0661_0001_0002$$$::Tohsaka walks away from the stairs and into the forest.::
71911::$$$message_0661_0002_0000$$$::"Are you all right, Rider? I know there's a Bounded Field around the temple. I heard Servants can't go in except by the front gate."::
71912::$$$message_0661_0003_0000$$$::"...There is a pressure, but it's bearable."[lr]::
71913::$$$message_0661_0003_0001$$$::Once we are inside the cave, we will be close to the best leylines in this land, as far as Servants are concerned. It will be easy to recover simply by absorbing mana from the air."[lr]::
71914::$$$message_0661_0003_0002$$$::"Okay. Well, hang in there."::
71915::$$$message_0661_0004_0000$$$::We push our way through the trees, walking through the night.[lr]::
71916::$$$message_0661_0004_0001$$$::There aren't even any game trails out here, and we mostly have to drop down small cliffs and rock walls.::
71917::$$$message_0661_0005_0000$$$::"Mm... I think Illya said it's around here... Shirou, do you see anything that looks like an entrance?"[lr]::
71918::$$$message_0661_0005_0001$$$::"That [font italic=true]looks[font italic=false] like an entrance?"::
71919::$$$message_0661_0006_0000$$$::"Any crevices that a person might fit through, or any suspicious shrines. It's supposed to be an entrance, so I don't think it'll be a pitfall."[lr]::
71920::$$$message_0661_0006_0001$$$::"...Don't be ridiculous. You think I can see in the forest at night just because the stars are out?"::
71921::$$$message_0661_0007_0000$$$::...Oh. I can see pretty well, actually.[lr]::
71922::$$$message_0661_0007_0001$$$::There are withered trees all around us. Maybe we're behind Ryudou Temple now.[lr]::
71923::$$$message_0661_0007_0002$$$::Of course, there are no man-made buildings in sight. All I see are the dead trees and a bubbling brook.::
71924::$$$message_0661_0008_0000$$$::"...A stream?"[lr]::
71925::$$$message_0661_0008_0001$$$::Wait.[lr]::
71926::$$$message_0661_0008_0002$$$::That means the water must be coming from somewhere.::
71927::$$$message_0661_0009_0000$$$::"...Rider, there's rocks stacked up beyond this stream, right?[lr]::
71928::$$$message_0661_0009_0001$$$::I can't see because it's so dark. Is there an opening back there?"[lr]::
71929::$$$message_0661_0009_0002$$$::"...Don't turn around, Shirou."[lr]::
71930::$$$message_0661_0009_0003$$$::I hear a small metallic sound, like a clasp being undone.[lr]::
71931::$$$message_0661_0009_0004$$$::Rider must have taken off her blindfold.::
71932::$$$message_0661_0010_0000$$$::"...There is. It's a natural cave. A human could fit through the opening. It looks like a dead end one meter beyond that, but I can sense magical camouflage."[lr]::
71933::$$$message_0661_0010_0001$$$::"Oh. Thanks...Tohsaka, we found something."::
71934::$$$message_0661_0011_0000$$$::I call out to Tohsaka and head down the stream.[lr]::
71935::$$$message_0661_0011_0001$$$::It turned out to be only a spring, rather than a river.::
71936::$$$message_0661_0012_0000$$$::It's flowing from several piles of rocks, and we finally come across an opening that one person can fit through.[lr]::
71937::$$$message_0661_0012_0001$$$::The rocks remind me of igloos.[lr]::
71938::$$$message_0661_0012_0002$$$::One could tell at a glance that you'd hit a rock as soon as you step inside, and no sane person would even think of entering.::
71939::$$$message_0661_0013_0000$$$::"...Nice find. We can slip through here, no problem."[lr]::
71940::$$$message_0661_0013_0001$$$::Tohsaka goes inside without looking back.[lr]::
71941::$$$message_0661_0013_0002$$$::"Go ahead. I will guard the rear."[lr]::
71942::$$$message_0661_0013_0003$$$::I nod at Rider and venture into the darkness.::
71943::$$$message_0661_0014_0000$$$::I make scraping sounds on the stone.[lr]::
71944::$$$message_0661_0014_0001$$$::I feel my way forward with my hands on the wet ground.[lr]::
71945::$$$message_0661_0014_0002$$$::The ground begins to slope dramatically.::
71946::$$$message_0661_0015_0000$$$::...It's tight and claustrophobic in the darkness.[lr]::
71947::$$$message_0661_0015_0001$$$::I'll tumble down into the infinite darkness unless I slowly go down on my back.::
71948::$$$message_0661_0016_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
71949::$$$message_0661_0016_0001$$$::In the dark, I make a slow descent, sprawled on the angled rock.[lr]::
71950::$$$message_0661_0016_0002$$$::...The way ahead is dark, and I can't tell how far down this goes.[lr]::
71951::$$$message_0661_0016_0003$$$::I can only hear my breathing.::
71952::$$$message_0661_0017_0000$$$::"Shirou. Let me ask you this while I can."[lr]::
71953::$$$message_0661_0017_0001$$$::Then,[lr]::
71954::$$$message_0661_0017_0002$$$::Tohsaka suddenly talks to me from ahead.::
71955::$$$message_0661_0018_0000$$$::"What is it?"[lr]::
71956::$$$message_0661_0018_0001$$$::"The Jeweled Sword. Why did you make it for me?"[lr]::
71957::$$$message_0661_0018_0002$$$::Her tone is bored, like she's making small talk to kill time because she's tired of climbing down.::
71958::$$$message_0661_0019_0000$$$::"Why? Why are you asking?"[lr]::
71959::$$$message_0661_0019_0001$$$::"Because. I said I was going to kill Sakura.[lr]::
71960::$$$message_0661_0019_0002$$$::Are you okay with giving me a weapon to do it?"[lr]::
71961::$$$message_0661_0019_0003$$$::"......"[lr]::
71962::$$$message_0661_0019_0004$$$::I nod in the dark.[lr]::
71963::$$$message_0661_0019_0005$$$::Tohsaka's right, of course.::
71964::$$$message_0661_0020_0000$$$::"I'm not okay with it. But I can't save Sakura without you, and we have a better chance together than alone.[lr]::
71965::$$$message_0661_0020_0001$$$::...Plus, I promised you that I'd Project the sword.[lr]::
71966::$$$message_0661_0020_0002$$$::I already broke one promise to you. I didn't want to break another."::
71967::$$$message_0661_0021_0000$$$::It was quite a while ago.[lr]::
71968::$$$message_0661_0021_0001$$$::After I lost Saber, I asked Tohsaka for help.[lr]::
71969::$$$message_0661_0021_0002$$$::She helped me, and I made her a promise: ::
71970::$$$message_0661_0022_0000$$$::I would make her win.[lr]::
71971::$$$message_0661_0022_0001$$$::I promised to make Tohsaka the victor of the Holy Grail War.::
71972::$$$message_0661_0023_0000$$$::...I can't keep that promise anymore.[lr]::
71973::$$$message_0661_0023_0001$$$::So, I want to at least keep my other promise.[lr]::
71974::$$$message_0661_0023_0002$$$::At that time...[lr]::
71975::$$$message_0661_0023_0003$$$::For Rin Tohsaka, the girl I liked at the time, who believed in me when I had nothing left.::
71976::$$$message_0661_0024_0000$$$::"Okay. You're a stickler for these things, huh?"[lr]::
71977::$$$message_0661_0024_0001$$$::"Yeah. Not as much as you are, though."::
71978::$$$message_0661_0025_0000$$$::The darkness goes still again.[lr]::
71979::$$$message_0661_0025_0001$$$::Our conversation ends there.[lr]::
71980::$$$message_0661_0025_0002$$$::We don't look at each other. We just stoically descend into the infernal depths.::
71981::$$$message_0661_0026_0000$$$::Our long path seems to take us through the underworld itself.[lr]::
71982::$$$message_0661_0026_0001$$$::It's a winding path, and my body feels like it's walked more than a hundred meters.[lr]::
71983::$$$message_0661_0026_0002$$$::We turn to find ourselves facing a dark cavern.::
71984::$$$message_0661_0027_0000$$$::The one-man-wide path becomes an ever deeper passage.[lr]::
71985::$$$message_0661_0027_0001$$$::We don't need any illumination.[lr]::
71986::$$$message_0661_0027_0002$$$::Some sort of luminescent moss suffuses the cavern with a green glow.::
71987::$$$message_0661_0028_0000$$$::The passage teems with life energy.[lr]::
71988::$$$message_0661_0028_0001$$$::It feels so raw.[lr]::
71989::$$$message_0661_0028_0002$$$::It's an air of birthing, filled with vitality, that seems to celebrate life.[lr]::
71990::$$$message_0661_0028_0003$$$::Abundant od and flowing mana, as far as the eye can see.::
71991::$$$message_0661_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
71992::$$$message_0661_0029_0001$$$::It's so raw that it makes me nauseous.[lr]::
71993::$$$message_0661_0029_0002$$$::The warmth of radiant life is so filthy I want to turn away from it.::
71994::$$$message_0661_0030_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
71995::$$$message_0661_0030_0001$$$::[font italic=true]"..."[font italic=false][lr]::
71996::$$$message_0661_0030_0002$$$::I have nothing to say.[lr]::
71997::$$$message_0661_0030_0003$$$::This is a land of death.[lr]::
71998::$$$message_0661_0030_0004$$$::Talking to Tohsaka would lower my guard enough to get me killed.::
71999::$$$message_0661_0031_0000$$$::"...Let's go. From here on out, prioritize your own life."[lr]::
72000::$$$message_0661_0031_0001$$$::Tohsaka goes deeper down the passage towards the source of the dark air.[lr]::
72001::$$$message_0661_0031_0002$$$::Rider and I move forward, keeping an eye on our surroundings.::
72002::$$$message_0661_0032_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
72003::$$$message_0661_0032_0001$$$::I see something red on the ground.[lr]::
72004::$$$message_0661_0032_0002$$$::These are unmistakably bloodstains.[lr]::
72005::$$$message_0661_0032_0003$$$::The blood spatter continues into the cave.::
72006::$$$message_0661_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72007::$$$message_0661_0033_0001$$$::Did someone get here before us?[lr]::
72008::$$$message_0661_0033_0002$$$::Were they wounded so badly that they bled everywhere they walked?::
72009::$$$message_0661_0034_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
72010::$$$message_0661_0034_0001$$$::"...Sorry, I'll be right there."[lr]::
72011::$$$message_0661_0034_0002$$$::I shake off the premonitions and keep walking.[lr]::
72012::$$$message_0661_0034_0003$$$::I can't afford to worry about anyone else now.::
72013::$$$message_0661_0035_0000$$$::"Nrgh..."[lr]::
72014::$$$message_0661_0035_0001$$$::If I lose focus, my mind will shut off.[lr]::
72015::$$$message_0661_0035_0002$$$::Worrying about extra things could erase me entirely.[lr]::
72016::$$$message_0661_0035_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
72017::$$$message_0661_0035_0004$$$::I grip the pendant tightly in my right hand.[lr]::
72018::$$$message_0661_0035_0005$$$::I use the pain to remind myself who I am, and step into the verdant dark.::
