40661::$$$message_0353_0000_0001$$$::They aren't opponents that we can take on by ourselves.[lr]::
40662::$$$message_0353_0000_0002$$$::There are three enemies.[lr]::
40663::$$$message_0353_0000_0003$$$::So we need at least one more person to cooperate with us.::
40664::$$$message_0353_0001_0000$$$::...In that case, our choices are limited.[lr]::
40665::$$$message_0353_0001_0001$$$::People who are also mages and have a reason to fight Caster.[lr]::
40666::$$$message_0353_0001_0002$$$::That is none other than another Master.::
40667::$$$message_0353_0002_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka, don't get mad and hear me out. Um, do you think we can cooperate with other Masters?"::
40668::$$$message_0353_0003_0000$$$::"...All right, what's your intention? You have some plan for you to say that right?"[lr]::
40669::$$$message_0353_0003_0001$$$::"Well, not really, but... The other Masters can't ignore Caster's current situation, right?[lr]::
40670::$$$message_0353_0003_0002$$$::Then I thought that maybe we can join hands just this time."::
40671::$$$message_0353_0004_0000$$$::"...Yes. I was actually thinking the same thing. Although I kept quiet since I thought you would object."::
40672::$$$message_0353_0005_0000$$$::She says with a reluctant expression.[lr]::
40673::$$$message_0353_0005_0001$$$::She must not like the idea deep down, but she must know that's the only option we have.::
40674::$$$message_0353_0006_0000$$$::"In that case, there are two Masters left... Lancer's Master and Berserker's Master.[lr]::
40675::$$$message_0353_0006_0001$$$::...Lancer's Master is still unknown so there's no way to negotiate, but we might have a chance with Berserker's Master, Illyasviel."::
40676::$$$message_0353_0007_0000$$$::Berserker's Master.[lr]::
40677::$$$message_0353_0007_0001$$$::The girl in white and the rock-like giant I met on the first day.[lr]::
40678::$$$message_0353_0007_0002$$$::Her actions were dangerous, but I don't think she's cruel.::
40679::$$$message_0353_0008_0000$$$::"...Yeah, that girl might at least listen to us. She doesn't seem like she would propose any absurd conditions in return either."::
40680::$$$message_0353_0009_0000$$$::"...Idiot. She's the most dangerous for you.[lr]::
40681::$$$message_0353_0009_0001$$$::She was only looking at you from the start. Putting myself aside, I don't know what she would do to you."::
40682::$$$message_0353_0010_0000$$$::"W...What do you mean? I only met that girl once, so that's not possible. D-Don't scare me like that, Tohsaka."::
40683::$$$message_0353_0011_0000$$$::"...Humph. Of course we'll break off the negotiation if that happens, idiot."[lr]::
40684::$$$message_0353_0011_0001$$$::And...[lr]::
40685::$$$message_0353_0011_0002$$$::She looks away, then chugs her tea.::
40686::$$$message_0353_0012_0000$$$::"...But, we can only bet on Illyasviel for now. If Caster's identity is like Archer said, Berserker would be a natural enemy without a doubt.[lr]::
40687::$$$message_0353_0012_0001$$$::They knew each other when they were alive, so he should know Caster's tricks. Berserker can handle both Caster and Archer, even if they attack at the same time. We just have to capture Kuzuki during that time."::
40688::$$$message_0353_0013_0000$$$::"That's idealistic, but... Tohsaka, do Caster and Berserker really know each other?"::
40689::$$$message_0353_0014_0000$$$::"Yes, Archer told me that Berserker's identity is Heracles.[lr]::
40690::$$$message_0353_0014_0001$$$::If Caster is actually that extraordinary witch, then they might know each other from the Argo Expedition.[lr]::
40691::$$$message_0353_0014_0002$$$::It's just like how I don't get along with Kirei. There're always people you won't get along with in this world."::
40692::$$$message_0353_0015_0000$$$::Huh.[lr]::
40693::$$$message_0353_0015_0001$$$::But Tohsaka, I'm sure anyone would dislike that priest.::
40694::$$$message_0353_0016_0000$$$::"...Then it's decided.[lr]::
40695::$$$message_0353_0016_0001$$$::But, how should we find her? She hasn't come out since, but with that much magical energy, we should be able to find her no matter where she hides, right?[lr]::
40696::$$$message_0353_0016_0002$$$::Yet we can't find her, so doesn't that mean she's not in this town?"::
40697::$$$message_0353_0017_0000$$$:: "Probably not. Illyasviel must be having fun watching the Holy Grail War from afar."[lr]::
40698::$$$message_0353_0017_0001$$$::"...From afar...? Is she keeping watch over the town like Caster is from Ryudou Temple?"::
40699::$$$message_0353_0018_0000$$$::"I don't know. But, I have an idea of where she might be.[lr]::
40700::$$$message_0353_0018_0001$$$:: ...I heard from my dad that the Einzbern family has a villa in the forest on the outskirts of town."::
40701::$$$message_0353_0019_0000$$$::She says with a tense voice.[lr]::
40702::$$$message_0353_0019_0001$$$::   A villa that stands in the forest on the outskirts...[lr]::
40703::$$$message_0353_0019_0002$$$::I can tell how dangerous the place is just from the way Tohsaka is acting.::αχ
