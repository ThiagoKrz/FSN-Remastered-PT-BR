16258::$$$message_0147_0000_0000$$$::Breakfast is the same as usual.[lr]::
16259::$$$message_0147_0000_0001$$$::I get the sense Saber and Tohsaka are pretty adaptable since they've already gotten used to Illya being here.::
16260::$$$message_0147_0001_0000$$$::"So what are you going to do, Shirou?[lr]::
16261::$$$message_0147_0001_0001$$$::There are three Masters left. The Holy Grail War isn't exactly never-ending, so you should think about making a move soon. Always being the one reacting to everyone else isn't a good look."::
16262::$$$message_0147_0002_0000$$$::Tohsaka's right.[lr]::
16263::$$$message_0147_0002_0001$$$::There's nothing wrong with me physically, and Saber's completely healed.[lr]::
16264::$$$message_0147_0002_0002$$$::We should be done resting as of yesterday.::
16265::$$$message_0147_0003_0000$$$::"You're right. You say we need to make a move, but it'll have to be at night.  We're going to do the same things we've been doing during the day."[lr]::
16266::$$$message_0147_0003_0001$$$::"Are you serious? Well, I guess it wouldn't do us any good if we just aimlessly wander around with no information about our opponents. So, Saber's going to beat you up again today?"::
16267::$$$message_0147_0004_0000$$$::I'm going to continue my sword training with Saber.[lr]::
16268::$$$message_0147_0004_0001$$$::That's what we've been doing every day, and a Master should always be prepared for battle.::
16269::$$$message_0147_0005_0000$$$::"Rin. What Shirou and I are doing is training. The way you phrased it may cause misunderstanding."[lr]::
16270::$$$message_0147_0005_0001$$$::"Well actually...yeah, I'm going to get beaten up by Saber in the morning, like usual."::
16271::$$$message_0147_0006_0000$$$::"Shirou...if you describe it that way as well, you put me in something of a difficult position."[lr]::
16272::$$$message_0147_0006_0001$$$::"Eh? Oh, sorry, Saber. I wasn't listening."::
16273::$$$message_0147_0007_0000$$$::"As I was saying, Rin's choice of words was too harsh.[lr]::
16274::$$$message_0147_0007_0001$$$::What is the matter with you, Shirou? You lack vigor this morning. The breakfast you prepared was also bland. Were you in the shed until late again last night?" ::
16275::$$$message_0147_0008_0000$$$::Saber may be questioning me, but there's no real bite to it.[lr]::
16276::$$$message_0147_0008_0001$$$::I can sense that she trusts me.[lr]::
16277::$$$message_0147_0008_0002$$$::Which makes it even harder to meet her gaze now.[lr]::
16278::$$$message_0147_0008_0003$$$::If our eyes meet, I can't help thinking of that scene in the hill.::
16279::$$$message_0147_0009_0000$$$::"...Fine. I will put some life into you later on. So we're going to be training in the dojo again today, alright?"[lr]::
16280::$$$message_0147_0009_0001$$$::"Yeah. What about you, Illya?"[lr]::
16281::$$$message_0147_0009_0002$$$::"Me? I'll do the same as yesterday. I don't like getting all wet in the rain, so I don't want to go outside."::
16282::$$$message_0147_0010_0000$$$::"Got it. That's perfect. I'd rather you stay in the house, since it's dangerous to go outside."[lr]::
16283::$$$message_0147_0010_0001$$$::"Yeah. If you make bento again like yesterday, I wouldn't mind joining you."::
16284::$$$message_0147_0011_0000$$$::Hm...[lr]::
16285::$$$message_0147_0011_0001$$$::It seems like Illya took a liking to the bento yesterday.[lr]::
16286::$$$message_0147_0011_0002$$$::I'm a little embarrassed that something so simple pleased her, but at the same time, I'm glad to know Illya enjoyed the bento I made.::
16287::$$$message_0147_0012_0000$$$::"Oh. So it'll be exactly the same as yesterday.[lr]::
16288::$$$message_0147_0012_0001$$$::I'm going to my room. I have some things to look up, but come by in the afternoon. There's something I want to talk to you about."[lr]::
16289::$$$message_0147_0012_0002$$$::"Are you researching something?"::
16290::$$$message_0147_0013_0000$$$::"Yep. I think you might have noticed, but something's been going on at Ryudou Temple since yesterday.[lr]::
16291::$$$message_0147_0013_0001$$$::They've been collecting magical energy really diligently this whole time, but that's stopped. Something's definitely going on.[lr]::
16292::$$$message_0147_0013_0002$$$::And I think that of the remaining Masters, our biggest threat is the one at Ryudou Temple. I'll send out a familiar and try to find out what's going on inside."::
16293::$$$message_0147_0014_0000$$$::"Then, should you not focus on your investigation? I do no see any need for you to take time off to teach Shirou."::
16294::$$$message_0147_0015_0000$$$::"Well, then I'm sorry, but you're just going to have to bear with me on that. I'm still worried about Shirou, so I can't just leave him to his own devices.[lr]::
16295::$$$message_0147_0015_0001$$$::It might be one thing for him to die at the hands of an enemy, but since I'm his teacher, it'd bother me if he did something dumb and got himself killed because he messed up his magecraft or something."::
16296::$$$message_0147_0016_0000$$$::"Yes. You are absolutely correct.[lr]::
16297::$$$message_0147_0016_0001$$$::Something must have been wrong with me. I do not know why I would have believed your lessons to be unnecessary."::
16298::$$$message_0147_0017_0000$$$::"Oh, the reasoning there is pretty simple, but best not to talk about it.[lr]::
16299::$$$message_0147_0017_0001$$$::Well, good luck with your morning training. Shirou's pretty resilient, so it's probably best if you just beat him within an inch of his life."::
16300::$$$message_0147_0018_0000$$$::And with that, Tohsaka leaves the room.::
16301::$$$message_0147_0019_0000$$$::"Saber. Take what Tohsaka says with a grain of salt. She can say that because she's never been hit by [font italic=true]you[font italic=false]."::
16302::$$$message_0147_0020_0000$$$::I tell her just in case.[lr]::
16303::$$$message_0147_0020_0001$$$::For some reason, she seems pleased.::
16304::$$$message_0147_0021_0000$$$::"Don't worry, I know. I understand your body better than she does."[lr]::
16305::$$$message_0147_0021_0001$$$::She responds calmly.::
