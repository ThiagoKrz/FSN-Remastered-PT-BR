65707::$$$message_0605_0001_0000$$$::I scrounge up every bit of strength and grit, and...::
65708::$$$message_0605_0002_0000$$$::"I'll follow your plan. We're only taking off the shroud, right?"::
65709::$$$message_0605_0003_0000$$$::I manage to make myself nod.::
65710::$$$message_0605_0004_0000$$$::"...Yeah. You'll do it, huh?"[lr]::
65711::$$$message_0605_0004_0001$$$::"What, Tohsaka? You don't like my answer?"::
65712::$$$message_0605_0005_0000$$$::"I didn't say that. I just remembered that it's pointless to try and intimidate you.[lr]::
65713::$$$message_0605_0005_0001$$$::I didn't expect you to say that you'd be okay with taking off the shroud. But I'm satisfied with your answer."[lr]::

65717::$$$message_0605_0007_0001$$$::It's the answer I wanted to hear, but it still pisses me off to hear it."::
65718::$$$message_0605_0008_0000$$$::"And Shirou, I said earlier that I'd never make you use Archer's arm. Meaning that I wouldn't make you take off the shroud.[lr]::
65719::$$$message_0605_0008_0001$$$::I know how this sounds right after I was trying to test you, but never say that you're going to take off the shroud again.[lr]::
65720::$$$message_0605_0008_0002$$$::...Once you do, there's no going back."::
