17659::$$$message_0165_0000_0000$$$::The sky was still pale gray.[lr]::
17660::$$$message_0165_0000_0001$$$::Was it dawn or dusk?[lr]::
17661::$$$message_0165_0000_0002$$$::It's hard to tell.::
17662::$$$message_0165_0001_0000$$$::The vast sky overhead, and a wide field stretching out on all sides...[lr]::
17663::$$$message_0165_0001_0001$$$::The sky seemed close enough to touch.[lr]::
17664::$$$message_0165_0001_0002$$$::Clouds...low enough to grab hold of.[lr]::
17665::$$$message_0165_0001_0003$$$::This was one of the battlefields she fought on.::
17666::$$$message_0165_0002_0000$$$::But there was no longer any cavalry in her service.[lr]::
17667::$$$message_0165_0002_0001$$$::The sprawling, golden meadow was gone.[lr]::
17668::$$$message_0165_0002_0002$$$::Instead, unfolding under the dull sky...::
17669::$$$message_0165_0003_0000$$$::                                   ...was the remnant of a battlefield.::
17670::$$$message_0165_0004_0000$$$::No emotion.[lr]::
17671::$$$message_0165_0004_0001$$$::She must have seen this kind of thing almost daily.[lr]::
17672::$$$message_0165_0004_0002$$$::Her desolate heart was empty.[lr]::
17673::$$$message_0165_0004_0003$$$::As she leaned against the golden sword, she exhaled deeply, and let her shoulders relax.::
17674::$$$message_0165_0005_0000$$$::The battle must have ended.[lr]::
17675::$$$message_0165_0005_0001$$$::After glancing over the bodies of the defeated soldiers, she returned to her camp.[lr]::
17676::$$$message_0165_0005_0002$$$::Those were the battles she experienced.[lr]::
17677::$$$message_0165_0005_0003$$$::Her cold, calm demeanor remain unchanged.[lr]::
17678::$$$message_0165_0005_0004$$$::No matter the predicament she's been in, she remained just like the woman I've always known.::
17679::$$$message_0165_0006_0000$$$::                                   And then I see the dream of a king.::
17680::$$$message_0165_0007_0000$$$::The moment she drew the sword, she stopped being human.[lr]::
17681::$$$message_0165_0007_0001$$$::She took over for her father as a feudal lord, and became a king with many knights.[lr]::
17682::$$$message_0165_0007_0002$$$::She was known as King Arthur, and Altria. The life of the girl who once aspired to be a knight changed so radically.::
17683::$$$message_0165_0008_0000$$$::She acted like she was the king's son.[lr]::
17684::$$$message_0165_0008_0001$$$::The ruler of territories and knights had to be male.[lr]::
17685::$$$message_0165_0008_0002$$$::Only her father and the mage knew the king was female.[lr]::
17686::$$$message_0165_0008_0003$$$::She covered herself in iron and hid that truth for the rest of her life.::
17687::$$$message_0165_0009_0000$$$::There were those who had their suspicions.[lr]::
17688::$$$message_0165_0009_0001$$$::But the King of Knights who wielded the sacred sword knew neither injury nor age.[lr]::
17689::$$$message_0165_0009_0002$$$::Excalibur was blessed with the protection of the fairies, making its possessor immortal.[lr]::
17690::$$$message_0165_0009_0003$$$::As such, nobody questioned her tiny frame, which was much too small for a knight, or her face, which may have appeared girlish. Instead, she was hailed as a truly beautiful king.::
17691::$$$message_0165_0010_0000$$$::And in fact, the king was invincible.[lr]::
17692::$$$message_0165_0010_0001$$$::Neither size nor appearance mattered.[lr]::
17693::$$$message_0165_0010_0002$$$::Those who lived in fear of the savage invaders desired a strong king, and the valiant knights would follow only a truly superior leader.::
17694::$$$message_0165_0011_0000$$$::The king satisfied each of these conditions.[lr]::
17695::$$$message_0165_0011_0001$$$::And so, nobody questioned the king's identity.[lr]::
17696::$$$message_0165_0011_0002$$$::It did not matter if the king was a child, or a woman.[lr]::
17697::$$$message_0165_0011_0003$$$::All that mattered was that the king protected the nation.::
17698::$$$message_0165_0012_0000$$$::The new king was fair and selfless, and always stood on the front line, fighting and defeating the nation's enemies on the battlefield.[lr]::
17699::$$$message_0165_0012_0001$$$::Many enemies and citizens died, but the king was always just, and she played her role as king better than anyone else.[lr]::
17700::$$$message_0165_0012_0002$$$::There was no room to suspect otherwise, and any such suspicions would be pointless while the king was right in any case.::
17701::$$$message_0165_0013_0000$$$::She knew no defeat on the battlefield.[lr]::
17702::$$$message_0165_0013_0001$$$::Her army reformed the lost cavalry, then charged across the battlefield, defeating foreign infantry and smashing through their defenses.::
17703::$$$message_0165_0014_0000$$$::Did she always stand on the front lines because her nation was behind her?::
17704::$$$message_0165_0015_0000$$$::Before she headed out to battle, she had to cast aside so many citizens.::
17705::$$$message_0165_0016_0000$$$::Once she was on the battlefield, she had to cut down all her enemies.::
17706::$$$message_0165_0017_0000$$$::As her battles were fought in defense of her nation, it was common to wring villages dry to support the army.::
17707::$$$message_0165_0018_0000$$$::In that sense, no knight killed as many as she did.::
17708::$$$message_0165_0019_0000$$$::I can't tell if she ever really felt that burden.[lr]::
17709::$$$message_0165_0019_0001$$$::It's not something I can really know from a dream.[lr]::
17710::$$$message_0165_0019_0002$$$::But I do know she didn't have a moment's doubt or hesitation on the battlefield.[lr]::
17711::$$$message_0165_0019_0003$$$::Grief never touched her thoughts when she sat on the throne.::
17712::$$$message_0165_0020_0000$$$::A king is not human.[lr]::
17713::$$$message_0165_0020_0001$$$::Human emotions would make it impossible to protect people.::
17714::$$$message_0165_0021_0000$$$::She kept to her oath, never wavering.[lr]::
17715::$$$message_0165_0021_0001$$$::She addressed the issues facing her nation, and she worked on matters of political concern.[lr]::
17716::$$$message_0165_0021_0002$$$::She ruled without wavering, and she punished the deserving without error.::
17717::$$$message_0165_0022_0000$$$::And after winning so many battles, unifying so many clans, and punishing hundreds of criminals...[lr]::
17718::$$$message_0165_0022_0001$$$::[font italic=true]"King Arthur doesn't have a human heart."[font italic=false][lr]::
17719::$$$message_0165_0022_0002$$$::One of the knights in her entourage murmured this.::
17720::$$$message_0165_0023_0000$$$::Everyone must have felt the same way.[lr]::
17721::$$$message_0165_0023_0001$$$::The more perfectly she carried herself as a king, the more everyone questioned their monarch.[lr]::
17722::$$$message_0165_0023_0002$$$::There is no way someone devoid of human emotion can rule humans.[lr]::
17723::$$$message_0165_0023_0003$$$::Several reputable knights left the white castle of Camelot, but the king accepted this as inevitable, and incorporated it into her rule.::
17724::$$$message_0165_0024_0000$$$::And so the fair king, once so admired by her knights, began to isolate herself.::
17725::$$$message_0165_0025_0000$$$::Such trivialities were of no concern to the king.[lr]::
17726::$$$message_0165_0025_0001$$$::Even if she was deserted, feared, or betrayed, her heart would remain unchanged.[lr]::
17727::$$$message_0165_0025_0002$$$::It couldn't be helped.[lr]::
17728::$$$message_0165_0025_0003$$$::The moment she took that sword, she abandoned her emotions.::
17729::$$$message_0165_0026_0000$$$::   And then her final battle began.::
17730::$$$message_0165_0027_0000$$$::The battle at Badon Hill ended in a complete victory, and that inescapable conclusion led to the savage clans finally offering peace.[lr]::
17731::$$$message_0165_0027_0001$$$::And so, the nation that had been holding its breath, waiting to be destroyed, knew a moment of peace.[lr]::
17732::$$$message_0165_0027_0002$$$::The age of warfare where a nation leaned on a singular hero, came to an end.[lr]::
17733::$$$message_0165_0027_0003$$$::Britain was finally going to become the nation she'd always dreamed of.::
17734::$$$message_0165_0028_0000$$$::...The scene starts to fade away.[lr]::
17735::$$$message_0165_0028_0001$$$::I realize the dream is ending and I'm about to wake up.[lr]::
17736::$$$message_0165_0028_0002$$$::I can feel myself drifting closer to wakefulness.::
17737::$$$message_0165_0029_0000$$$::But before that happens, something really pissed me off.[lr]::
17738::$$$message_0165_0029_0001$$$::...She's stupid.[lr]::
17739::$$$message_0165_0029_0002$$$::Oh, she's strong, and a gifted fighter.[lr]::
17740::$$$message_0165_0029_0003$$$::But there's a difference between being good at fighting and being cut out for it.::
17741::$$$message_0165_0030_0000$$$::The people around her pissed me off too.[lr]::
17742::$$$message_0165_0030_0001$$$::If she didn't notice it, someone else around her should have told her, or she would go on making the same mistake forever.[lr]::
17743::$$$message_0165_0030_0002$$$::Seriously...how the hell did she have so many people around her, and not one told her the truth?::
17744::$$$message_0165_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
17745::$$$message_0165_0031_0001$$$::I wake up.[lr]::
17746::$$$message_0165_0031_0002$$$::   We escaped Illya's forest and returned home yesterday afternoon.[lr]::
17747::$$$message_0165_0031_0003$$$::Tohsaka went back to her room, complaining her stomach hurt, and my headache wasn't getting any better, so we all decided to just go to sleep.::
17748::$$$message_0165_0032_0000$$$::It must have been the extra weight I was lugging around.[lr]::
17749::$$$message_0165_0032_0001$$$::As soon as I got into bed, I couldn't get back up.[lr]::
17750::$$$message_0165_0032_0002$$$::Saber was the only one who seemed fine, and Tohsaka and I left her to guard the house while we slept. And then...::
17751::$$$message_0165_0033_0000$$$::"So I slept for half a day. At least my headache's gone."[lr]::
17752::$$$message_0165_0033_0001$$$::I'm relieved.[lr]::
17753::$$$message_0165_0033_0002$$$::The whole thing with Berserker...[lr]::
17754::$$$message_0165_0033_0003$$$::The headache I got after copying Saber's sword was unreal.[lr]::
17755::$$$message_0165_0033_0004$$$::If It had kept up, my head might well have just split down the middle.::
17756::$$$message_0165_0034_0000$$$::Then I notice…[lr]::
17757::$$$message_0165_0034_0001$$$::"Huh!?"[lr]::
17758::$$$message_0165_0034_0002$$$::Saber is sitting on the floor, right next to my head.::
17759::$$$message_0165_0035_0000$$$::"...Sa...ber? Why're you glaring at me like that first thing in the morning? Did something happen while I was asleep?"[lr]::
17760::$$$message_0165_0035_0001$$$::"...No. I simply had a dream."[lr]::
17761::$$$message_0165_0035_0002$$$::"Hm?"::
17762::$$$message_0165_0036_0000$$$::"...No, it is nothing. Let us have breakfast. It is time to wake up."[lr]::
17763::$$$message_0165_0036_0001$$$::Saber gets up and heads silently out of my room.::
17764::$$$message_0165_0037_0000$$$::"What was that about?"[lr]::
17765::$$$message_0165_0037_0001$$$::I don't know why Saber's acting strange.[lr]::
17766::$$$message_0165_0037_0002$$$::I'm really not sure, but...::
17767::$$$message_0165_0038_0000$$$::"If she was sitting by my bedside the whole time...was she nursing me back to health?"[lr]::
17768::$$$message_0165_0038_0001$$$::The moment I have that thought, the scene from last night comes back to me.::
17769::$$$message_0165_0039_0000$$$::"Wha... What the hell am I thinking!?"[lr]::
17770::$$$message_0165_0039_0001$$$::I shake my head to rid myself of those impure thoughts.[lr]::
17771::$$$message_0165_0039_0002$$$::That night, my contact with Saber was entirely about my duty as a Master.[lr]::
17772::$$$message_0165_0039_0003$$$::If I don't rationalize it like that, I'll never be able to look at Saber again.::
17773::$$$message_0165_0041_0000$$$::"Calm thoughts... Calm thoughts.[lr]::
17774::$$$message_0165_0041_0001$$$::We acted normal when we were coming home yesterday.[lr]::
17775::$$$message_0165_0041_0002$$$::That's all I need to do."::
17776::$$$message_0165_0042_0000$$$::No, I was actually just tired yesterday. But I still need to act normal.[lr]::
17777::$$$message_0165_0042_0001$$$::...Besides, Saber wouldn't like me acting like this.::
17778::$$$message_0165_0043_0000$$$::"Okay. I just need to calm down and make breakfast."[lr]::
17779::$$$message_0165_0043_0001$$$::I take a deep breath and get changed.[lr]::
17780::$$$message_0165_0043_0002$$$::It's nine in the morning.[lr]::
17781::$$$message_0165_0043_0003$$$::Saber hasn't eaten since lunch yesterday, so she must be hungry.::
17782::$$$message_0165_0044_0000$$$::Nine is so late, it's practically not even morning anymore.[lr]::
17783::$$$message_0165_0044_0001$$$::As hungry as Saber must be, I should probably make a hearty breakfast.::
17784::$$$message_0165_0045_0000$$$::"Shirou. Is it just you and I this morning? Do we not need to wake Rin up?"::
17785::$$$message_0165_0046_0000$$$::"No, everyone's still asleep. Considering what happened yesterday, it's probably best to let them sleep. I'll leave their food out, and they can eat whenever they like."::
17786::$$$message_0165_0047_0000$$$::"I see. Then I would appreciate it if you prepared the meal quickly. It is much later than usual."[lr]::
17787::$$$message_0165_0047_0001$$$::"I know. I feel better now, so let's head to the dojo once we finish eating."::
17788::$$$message_0165_0048_0000$$$::"Eh? The dojo? Do you intend to continue your training with me?"[lr]::
17789::$$$message_0165_0048_0001$$$::"Why not? It's our daily routine."::
17790::$$$message_0165_0049_0000$$$::"What's wrong, Saber? Did I say something weird?"[lr]::
17791::$$$message_0165_0049_0001$$$::"Oh...no. I just assumed we would no longer be training.[lr]::
17792::$$$message_0165_0049_0002$$$::With Berserker defeated, I thought there would be no further reason for you to continue training as we had been."::
17793::$$$message_0165_0050_0000$$$::"I see. You know, you may be right."[lr]::
17794::$$$message_0165_0050_0001$$$::The common enemy we all share in Berserker is gone now.[lr]::
17795::$$$message_0165_0050_0002$$$::We teamed up to take on an enemy far stronger than us, and that's also why I trained so furiously in such a short period of time.::
17796::$$$message_0165_0051_0000$$$::"Hmmm, but I'd like to keep training. I'm still an untrained mage, and I get to see the real you when you wield a sword. That makes it easier for me to talk to you too."[lr]::
17797::$$$message_0165_0051_0001$$$::Well, I say easy, but what I mean is that I kind of enjoy it.::
17798::$$$message_0165_0052_0000$$$::"Huh. So I reveal my true self when I am in the dojo?"::
17799::$$$message_0165_0053_0000$$$::"You sure do. At least you don't hold back.[lr]::
17800::$$$message_0165_0053_0001$$$::I prefer it that way. Besides, I think you get to loosen up as well. Anyway, our routine has been us sparring in the mornings. Don't take the few pleasures I have."::
17801::$$$message_0165_0054_0000$$$::I take the ground beef and pork, green onions, mushrooms, onions, and eggs out of the refrigerator and head to the kitchen.[lr]::
17802::$$$message_0165_0054_0001$$$::All I need is panko, sake, and cooking oil...::
17803::$$$message_0165_0055_0000$$$::"Well, then...I have no objections."[lr]::
17804::$$$message_0165_0055_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
17805::$$$message_0165_0055_0002$$$::Saber mumbles quietly to herself in the living room while I work.[lr]::
17806::$$$message_0165_0055_0003$$$::I can't quite hear what she's saying from the kitchen.::
