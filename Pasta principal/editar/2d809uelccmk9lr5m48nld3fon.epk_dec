15658::$$$message_0145_0000_0000$$$::Saber raises her sword.[lr]::
15659::$$$message_0145_0000_0001$$$::She's already closed in on Caster.::
15660::$$$message_0145_0001_0000$$$::"No...don't Saber!"[lr]::
15661::$$$message_0145_0001_0001$$$::I desperately sprint toward Saber, my heart racing.::
15662::$$$message_0145_0002_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
15663::$$$message_0145_0002_0001$$$::Saber suddenly halts.[lr]::
15664::$$$message_0145_0002_0002$$$::It's not clear whether Caster did anything.[lr]::
15665::$$$message_0145_0002_0003$$$::Saber tenses up after sensing something from Caster.::
15666::$$$message_0145_0003_0000$$$::"You...that is...!"[lr]::
15667::$$$message_0145_0003_0001$$$::Saber twists away to dodge.[lr]::
15668::$$$message_0145_0003_0002$$$::However...[lr]::
15669::$$$message_0145_0003_0003$$$::Bony arms burst from the ground to grab her legs!::
15670::$$$message_0145_0004_0000$$$::"Hmph. I wasn't expecting you to have such foresight. But this ends here, Saber!"[lr]::
15671::$$$message_0145_0004_0001$$$::A sharp blade emerges from the folds of Caster's robe.::
15672::$$$message_0145_0005_0000$$$::It's an oddly shaped dagger.[lr]::
15673::$$$message_0145_0005_0001$$$::Thin and brittle...that blade isn't meant for killing.[lr]::
15674::$$$message_0145_0005_0002$$$::Saber regards it in disgust, and Caster strikes, clearly seeing her opportunity for victory.::
15675::$$$message_0145_0006_0000$$$::Being grabbed from the ground must have surprised Saber...[lr]::
15676::$$$message_0145_0006_0001$$$::As Saber is unable to dodge or deflect the falling dagger, and simply takes the blow, looking astonished.[lr]::
15677::$$$message_0145_0006_0002$$$::"Why YOU...!"::
15678::$$$message_0145_0007_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
15679::$$$message_0145_0007_0001$$$::I hear Caster's voice from behind me somewhere.[lr]::
15680::$$$message_0145_0007_0002$$$::I can't see her expression.[lr]::
15681::$$$message_0145_0007_0003$$$::The only thing I can do is throw myself in front of Saber and take the blow in her place.::
15682::$$$message_0145_0008_0000$$$::"Gnh...owww...!!!"[lr]::
15683::$$$message_0145_0008_0001$$$::It wasn't graceful.[lr]::
15684::$$$message_0145_0008_0002$$$::I didn't have the confidence to just step in and take the dagger to the chest.[lr]::
15685::$$$message_0145_0008_0003$$$::So instead, I tried to shield Saber, hugging her to obscure Caster's target.[lr]::
15686::$$$message_0145_0008_0004$$$::And so Caster's dagger plunges into my back, tearing through my spine in a moment of unbelievable pain.::
15687::$$$message_0145_0009_0000$$$::"Ngh...gahhh!!!"[lr]::
15688::$$$message_0145_0009_0001$$$::I stop myself from crying out in pain, and muster my strength to support Saber.::
15689::$$$message_0145_0010_0000$$$::"Shi...rou...?"[lr]::
15690::$$$message_0145_0010_0001$$$::I can't hear what she's saying, even as close as she is to my ear.[lr]::
15691::$$$message_0145_0010_0002$$$::"Get...back... Saber, get behind...me..."[lr]::
15692::$$$message_0145_0010_0003$$$::Saber understands before I can gather my voice to tell her to jump.::
15693::$$$message_0145_0011_0000$$$::I go flying.[lr]::
15694::$$$message_0145_0011_0001$$$::Saber shakes off the bony hands gripping her legs and carries me with her.::
15695::$$$message_0145_0012_0000$$$::"Shirou, your wound...!"[lr]::
15696::$$$message_0145_0012_0001$$$::Saber's voice is urgent.[lr]::
15697::$$$message_0145_0012_0002$$$::She lays me gently on the ground, but the pain only grows worse.[lr]::
15698::$$$message_0145_0012_0003$$$::It feels like scissors tore open my back and someone poured lead down my spine.[lr]::
15699::$$$message_0145_0012_0004$$$::The pain is unreal...::
15700::$$$message_0145_0013_0000$$$::"Shirou. Stay calm! Shirou!!!"[lr]::
15701::$$$message_0145_0013_0001$$$::...But I'm not exactly losing my mind over it.[lr]::
15702::$$$message_0145_0013_0002$$$::Hearing Saber practically shouting actually makes me calmer.::
15703::$$$message_0145_0014_0000$$$::"Dummy. You don't have to shout. I can hear you.[lr]::
15704::$$$message_0145_0014_0001$$$::This is nothing... It just hurts. Forget about me. Take care of Caster."[lr]::
15705::$$$message_0145_0014_0002$$$::I point in Caster's direction, my head still down.::
15706::$$$message_0145_0015_0000$$$::"Yes. I will settle things right away. Please hold on a little longer."[lr]::
15707::$$$message_0145_0015_0001$$$::Saber turns towards Caster.::
15708::$$$message_0145_0016_0000$$$::"So that was your Noble Phantasm, was it not, Caster?"[lr]::
15709::$$$message_0145_0016_0001$$$::Saber's voice is harsh, angry.[lr]::
15710::$$$message_0145_0016_0002$$$::The black shadow clicks her tongue in irritation and raises the strange dagger in her hand.::
15711::$$$message_0145_0017_0000$$$::"Yes. As you can see it is unfit for killing anyone. But as you have sensed, it is my magical trump card, with limitless power for a single purpose.[lr]::
15712::$$$message_0145_0017_0001$$$::If you do not wish it to touch you, I advise against coming near me, Saber."::
15713::$$$message_0145_0018_0000$$$::Caster's talking bold, but she doesn't seem as composed as earlier.[lr]::
15714::$$$message_0145_0018_0001$$$::Even a powerful mage like Caster can't hurt Saber as long as she's only using magecraft.[lr]::
15715::$$$message_0145_0018_0002$$$::Whatever her Noble Phantasm might be, it can't hurt Saber, even if she surprises her with it.::
15716::$$$message_0145_0019_0000$$$::"You should be...beat her...no problem..."[lr]::
15717::$$$message_0145_0019_0001$$$::I give my orders through gritted teeth.::
15718::$$$message_0145_0020_0000$$$::"Oh, are you sure, Saber? You could certainly corner me. But who will protect him while you do?[lr]::
15719::$$$message_0145_0020_0001$$$::Shall I remind you that my magecraft is only ineffective against you? Can you imagine what I might do with my back up against a wall, and you not there to protect the boy?"::
15720::$$$message_0145_0021_0000$$$::"Why, you...!"[lr]::
15721::$$$message_0145_0021_0001$$$::Saber's voice rumbles up from deep in her chest.::
15722::$$$message_0145_0022_0000$$$::The rattling of bones grows louder.[lr]::
15723::$$$message_0145_0022_0001$$$::I'm kneeling on the ground, and Saber holds her sword, defending me as the bones surround us.::
15724::$$$message_0145_0023_0000$$$::"Damn...it."[lr]::
15725::$$$message_0145_0023_0001$$$::I messed up.[lr]::
15726::$$$message_0145_0023_0002$$$::Even if I managed to save Saber, there's no point with me being left so weak.[lr]::
15727::$$$message_0145_0023_0003$$$::I can't move properly, so I'm just slowing Saber down.[lr]::
15728::$$$message_0145_0023_0004$$$::Caster would be no threat to Saber alone, but with me to worry about...::
15729::$$$message_0145_0024_0000$$$::"You said you came to talk, Caster?"[lr]::
15730::$$$message_0145_0024_0001$$$::"What? Sa...ber...?"[lr]::
15731::$$$message_0145_0024_0002$$$::"Please be quiet, Master. This is the best choice right now."::
15732::$$$message_0145_0025_0000$$$::Saber lowers her sword.[lr]::
15733::$$$message_0145_0025_0001$$$::I think I hear Caster laugh amid the sound of the rattling bones all around us.::
15734::$$$message_0145_0026_0000$$$::"Let us hear what you have to say, Caster. Depending on what conditions you offer, we might let you go."[lr]::
15735::$$$message_0145_0026_0001$$$::"Are you quite mad? Do you not understand your lives are in my hands?[lr]::
15736::$$$message_0145_0026_0002$$$::Get too bold, and I just might crush you."::
15737::$$$message_0145_0027_0000$$$::"Do not misunderstand your position. You hold my Master's life in your hands, not mine.[lr]::
15738::$$$message_0145_0027_0001$$$::Should you snuff out that life, I will not hesitate to attack. I will use every ounce of power in my sword to burn you to cinders, even if I disappear as I do so."::
15739::$$$message_0145_0028_0000$$$::The air around us goes cold.[lr]::
15740::$$$message_0145_0028_0001$$$::Saber's words intimidate Caster. I can feel it.::
15741::$$$message_0145_0029_0000$$$::"Fine. I will not touch the boy. You are my target in any case. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to let just one Master off."[lr]::
15742::$$$message_0145_0029_0001$$$::"What? I was your target all this time?"::
15743::$$$message_0145_0030_0000$$$::"Indeed. I cannot simply ignore the Heroic Spirit who defeated Berserker. You and I, along with Lancer, are the only Servants who remain. With you as an ally, Lancer would be no threat at all."::
15744::$$$message_0145_0031_0000$$$::"Only three remain? Does that mean Assassin was defeated?"[lr]::
15745::$$$message_0145_0031_0001$$$::"Who knows? But he is gone now, so that must mean he was defeated. A Servant who can't even protect his own lord deserves no more than that."::
15746::$$$message_0145_0032_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
15747::$$$message_0145_0032_0001$$$::Assassin was defeated?[lr]::
15748::$$$message_0145_0032_0002$$$::Does that mean the Master in Ryudou Temple is gone?[lr]::
15749::$$$message_0145_0032_0003$$$::I didn't fight them, or even know who they were, but now there's one less Master.[lr]::
15750::$$$message_0145_0032_0004$$$::So the only remaining Servants are Saber, Caster, and Lancer, who hasn't shown up since that first night.::
15751::$$$message_0145_0033_0000$$$::"Hmph. This conversation is over.[lr]::
15752::$$$message_0145_0033_0001$$$::What I want is your Noble Phantasm. If you do not wish your Master to die, then kindly give me your sword."::
15753::$$$message_0145_0034_0000$$$::"There would be no point in doing so. Only I can wield this sword.[lr]::
15754::$$$message_0145_0034_0001$$$::If you are a Heroic Spirit, you should know very well that a Noble Phantasm can only be used by its owner."::
15755::$$$message_0145_0035_0000$$$::"Oh yes. I suppose I will just have to take you as well then, Saber.[lr]::
15756::$$$message_0145_0035_0001$$$::No matter how skilled the knight, they can be persuaded once captured. And you are my type too.[lr]::
15757::$$$message_0145_0035_0002$$$::I so look forward to teaching you manners."::
15758::$$$message_0145_0036_0000$$$::Her voice drips with amusement.[lr]::
15759::$$$message_0145_0036_0001$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
15760::$$$message_0145_0036_0002$$$::I feel myself on the verge of passing out, even as my anger boils over.[lr]::
15761::$$$message_0145_0036_0003$$$::I try to shove the pain aside and start to force myself to stand on numb legs.::
15762::$$$message_0145_0037_0000$$$::"You piece...of...!"[lr]::
15763::$$$message_0145_0037_0001$$$::I'm not going to let Saber get captured because of me.[lr]::
15764::$$$message_0145_0037_0002$$$::I decided I'm going to protect Saber, so I'm not letting a wound like this bring me down[line2]::
15765::$$$message_0145_0038_0000$$$::I grab my wooden sword and start slashing at the bones surrounding us.::
15766::$$$message_0145_0039_0000$$$::"No, Shirou!"[lr]::
15767::$$$message_0145_0039_0001$$$::Saber's voice is brittle, tense.[lr]::
15768::$$$message_0145_0039_0002$$$::"Oho. If you want to kill yourself, I won't stop you."[lr]::
15769::$$$message_0145_0039_0003$$$::Caster mocks me as I struggle.[lr]::
15770::$$$message_0145_0039_0004$$$::Bones crack and rattle.::
15771::$$$message_0145_0040_0000$$$::And as if to muffle all those sounds...[lr]::
15772::$$$message_0145_0040_0001$$$::...the bones are swept aside in the blink of an eye by a sudden volley of arrows.::
15773::$$$message_0145_0041_0000$$$::"What...!?"[lr]::
15774::$$$message_0145_0041_0001$$$::We all stand, dumbfounded.[lr]::
15775::$$$message_0145_0041_0002$$$::The arrows that rained down on us disappear as if they had been an illusion.[lr]::
15776::$$$message_0145_0041_0003$$$::But they weren't.[lr]::
15777::$$$message_0145_0041_0004$$$::The entire horde of bones is gone.::
15778::$$$message_0145_0042_0000$$$::"Kngh...!? Who's there!?"[lr]::
15779::$$$message_0145_0042_0001$$$::Caster looks up.[lr]::
15780::$$$message_0145_0042_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15781::$$$message_0145_0042_0003$$$::Saber must have noticed earlier.[lr]::
15782::$$$message_0145_0042_0004$$$::Well before Caster, she stares up towards the wall in disbelief.::
15783::$$$message_0145_0043_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15784::$$$message_0145_0043_0001$$$::I don't understand what I'm seeing.[lr]::
15785::$$$message_0145_0043_0002$$$::There is a golden figure standing, with the moon behind them.[lr]::
15786::$$$message_0145_0043_0003$$$::It's a man, clad in golden armor, looking down at the yard with a cruel smile.::
15787::$$$message_0145_0044_0000$$$::"Wh-who's there!?"[lr]::
15788::$$$message_0145_0044_0001$$$::Caster raises her voice, instinctively realizing that this is the one who annihilated her troops.::
15789::$$$message_0145_0045_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15790::$$$message_0145_0045_0001$$$::He gives no answer. He's not even looking at Caster.[lr]::
15791::$$$message_0145_0045_0002$$$::His eyes are fixed on one person alone: [lr]::
15792::$$$message_0145_0045_0003$$$::Saber.::
15793::$$$message_0145_0046_0000$$$::"Answer! I am asking who you are!"[lr]::
15794::$$$message_0145_0046_0001$$$::Caster's voice is heavy with emotion.[lr]::
15795::$$$message_0145_0046_0002$$$::The golden-armored man finally looks at her.::
15796::$$$message_0145_0047_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
15797::$$$message_0145_0047_0001$$$::Caster gasps as the man's red eyes bore into her.[lr]::
15798::$$$message_0145_0047_0002$$$::His gaze is impossibly cold.[lr]::
15799::$$$message_0145_0047_0003$$$::He doesn't even see Caster as human.[lr]::
15800::$$$message_0145_0047_0004$$$::I can tell, as far away as I am.[lr]::
15801::$$$message_0145_0047_0005$$$::I don't blame Caster for being intimidated, like some icy hand has a grip on her heart, since she looked straight into his eyes.::
15802::$$$message_0145_0048_0000$$$::"Wh-why are you getting in my way?"[lr]::
15803::$$$message_0145_0048_0001$$$::Caster's voice trembles as she speaks.[lr]::
15804::$$$message_0145_0048_0002$$$::She must know she's doomed if she doesn't do [font italic=true]something[font italic=false].[lr]::
15805::$$$message_0145_0048_0003$$$::But...::
15806::$$$message_0145_0049_0000$$$::"I have no reason to address myself to a mongrel. Begone, clown."[lr]::
15807::$$$message_0145_0049_0001$$$::His answer comes as a death sentence.::
15808::$$$message_0145_0050_0000$$$::I hear a loud snap.[lr]::
15809::$$$message_0145_0050_0001$$$::By the time I realize it's the sound of him clicking his fingers, the tragedy has begun.::
15810::$$$message_0145_0051_0000$$$::Myriad weapons appear in the air, shooting toward Caster like bullets from a machine gun.::
15811::$$$message_0145_0052_0000$$$::"[margos]"[lr]::
15812::$$$message_0145_0052_0001$$$::Caster raises her arm.[lr]::
15813::$$$message_0145_0052_0002$$$::A conceptual shield envelops her.[lr]::
15814::$$$message_0145_0052_0003$$$::It forms a glassy film in front of Caster.::
15815::$$$message_0145_0053_0000$$$::It is likely every bit as durable as Berserker himself.[lr]::
15816::$$$message_0145_0053_0001$$$::But her efforts are probably fruitless, as the barrier is merely glass.[lr]::
15817::$$$message_0145_0053_0002$$$::Her crystalline barrier shatters under the deadly rain of so many weapons.::
15818::$$$message_0145_0054_0000$$$::"Eh...?"[lr]::
15819::$$$message_0145_0054_0001$$$::She sounds utterly dumbfounded.[lr]::
15820::$$$message_0145_0054_0002$$$::With not a modicum of concern for Caster as she so pitifully tilts her head in wonder, the weapons tear through her dark robe.[lr]::
15821::$$$message_0145_0054_0003$$$::They are merciless.[lr]::
15822::$$$message_0145_0054_0004$$$::Spears tear into her, sending fabric flying, only for yet more of them to[se file=se284 nowait=true] plunge into her body.::
15823::$$$message_0145_0055_0000$$$::Swords cut down her falling form, while arrows sail toward an arm as it is about to hit the ground. An axe chops off a head about to complain of the pain... All of it brings Caster to untold peaks of agony.[lr]::
15824::$$$message_0145_0055_0001$$$::She can't possibly survive.[lr]::
15825::$$$message_0145_0055_0002$$$::Caster, succumbing to an endless hail of so many different weapons, is no longer even recognizably human.::
15826::$$$message_0145_0056_0000$$$::The wind flows.[lr]::
15827::$$$message_0145_0056_0001$$$::Her tattered, empty robe floats away.[lr]::
15828::$$$message_0145_0056_0002$$$::The shredded pieces of it fly skyward in the evening breeze.[lr]::
15829::$$$message_0145_0056_0003$$$::That torn robe tries valiantly to hold its form.[lr]::
15830::$$$message_0145_0056_0004$$$::Maybe because it's the only thing remaining to remind us of Caster.::
15831::$$$message_0145_0057_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15832::$$$message_0145_0057_0001$$$::I'm completely speechless.[lr]::
15833::$$$message_0145_0057_0002$$$::My frozen mind is fixed on the miserable remnants of that robe as they float away.::
15834::$$$message_0145_0058_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
15835::$$$message_0145_0058_0001$$$::"Insolent fool. I told her to begone from my sight. The sensible thing to do would have been to graciously commit suicide before me!"[lr]::
15836::$$$message_0145_0058_0002$$$::The man in gold grunts contemptuously.::
15837::$$$message_0145_0059_0000$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
15838::$$$message_0145_0059_0001$$$::I'm...not hallucinating.[lr]::
15839::$$$message_0145_0059_0002$$$::The dark robe twists like the coils of a snake, then sprouts wings to fly away.::
15840::$$$message_0145_0060_0000$$$::But it's too late.[lr]::
15841::$$$message_0145_0060_0001$$$::I don't know what the man did.[lr]::
15842::$$$message_0145_0060_0002$$$::I only see a crack in the night sky itself.[lr]::
15843::$$$message_0145_0060_0003$$$::Like a wave breaking out at sea, the fault line engulfs the fluttering robe.[lr]::
15844::$$$message_0145_0060_0004$$$::It's like...a person being run over by a steamroller.::
15845::$$$message_0145_0061_0000$$$::"Ah...ah...!!!"[lr]::
15846::$$$message_0145_0061_0001$$$::The robe falls.[lr]::
15847::$$$message_0145_0061_0002$$$::Caster is beneath it, unscathed.[lr]::
15848::$$$message_0145_0061_0003$$$::And then...[lr]::
15849::$$$message_0145_0061_0004$$$::A storm of magical swords rains down onto her.::
15850::$$$message_0145_0062_0000$$$::"Haaaa, ah...AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"[lr]::
15851::$$$message_0145_0062_0001$$$::Her scream splits the night.[lr]::
15852::$$$message_0145_0062_0002$$$::More swords fall upon her in response, and her scream grows louder.::
15853::$$$message_0145_0063_0000$$$::"Ah...ha..ggh...pull them out... It hurts... Pull them out... Ple...ase...!!!"[lr]::
15854::$$$message_0145_0063_0001$$$::Caster must be able to heal herself like Saber.[lr]::
15855::$$$message_0145_0063_0002$$$::Even all those swords impaling her is still not enough to kill her, but it's hard to watch.::
15856::$$$message_0145_0064_0000$$$::The torrent of swords do not stop.[lr]::
15857::$$$message_0145_0064_0001$$$::Each weapon is different; no two are alike.[lr]::
15858::$$$message_0145_0064_0002$$$::And, as much as I don't want to admit it, each of the weapons is a magical sword or spear, and is easily a match for a Servant's Noble Phantasm.::
15859::$$$message_0145_0065_0000$$$::"No way...that isn't possible... There can't be so many..."[lr]::
15860::$$$message_0145_0065_0001$$$::An inexhaustible supply of Noble Phantasms rains down onto Caster.[lr]::
15861::$$$message_0145_0065_0002$$$::Seeing the way she struggles under it is just...::
15862::$$$message_0145_0066_0000$$$::"Kugh...am I...going to die...? Am I going to[nolr]::
15863::$$$message_0145_0066_0001$$$::...die from...something so ridiculous...as...ha...[nolr]::
15864::$$$message_0145_0066_0002$$$::Ha. How...funny... This must be some...joke...aha...ha...[nolr]::
15865::$$$message_0145_0066_0003$$$::Haha...ahahahaha...AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA[nolr]::
15866::$$$message_0145_0066_0004$$$::AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHHAHAHA[nolr]::
15867::$$$message_0145_0066_0005$$$::HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHHHHHHH[nolr]::
15868::$$$message_0145_0066_0006$$$::AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!"::
15869::$$$message_0145_0067_0000$$$::And that is the end of Caster.[lr]::
15870::$$$message_0145_0067_0001$$$::She disappears, along with the black mist that was hiding her.::
15871::$$$message_0145_0068_0000$$$::The infinite cycle of torture that seemed to drag on forever lasted, in actuality, about ten seconds.[lr]::
15872::$$$message_0145_0068_0001$$$::During that time...[lr]::
15873::$$$message_0145_0068_0002$$$::Saber stood, scowling at the golden knight.::
15874::$$$message_0145_0069_0000$$$::"Hmph. A mere mage even mentioning capturing what belongs to the King of Knights is a great sin.[lr]::
15875::$$$message_0145_0069_0001$$$::I am king, and she is mine. Any fool who meddles with a king's treasure is fit for nothing else but such a death."::
15876::$$$message_0145_0070_0000$$$::"Now then...it has been a while, Saber. Do you remember the decision I made?"[lr]::
15877::$$$message_0145_0070_0001$$$::His tone turns amicable as he addresses Saber.[lr]::
15878::$$$message_0145_0070_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15879::$$$message_0145_0070_0003$$$::But Saber doesn't answer.[lr]::
15880::$$$message_0145_0070_0004$$$::She only glares all the more intensely at him.::
15881::$$$message_0145_0071_0000$$$::"Why do you look at me like that? Have you not made your choice yet?[lr]::
15882::$$$message_0145_0071_0001$$$::It's been ten years.[lr]::
15883::$$$message_0145_0071_0002$$$::That should have been time enough to decide... Ah, I suppose it has only been ten years for me. To you, it must seem like yesterday.[lr]::
15884::$$$message_0145_0071_0003$$$::What a foolish woman you are, making me wait so long.'::
15885::$$$message_0145_0072_0000$$$::He laughs heartily.[lr]::
15886::$$$message_0145_0072_0001$$$::My heart's pounding.[lr]::
15887::$$$message_0145_0072_0002$$$::Partly from the disaster I just witnessed.[lr]::
15888::$$$message_0145_0072_0003$$$::But beyond that, the way he's looking at Saber is making me nauseous.::
15889::$$$message_0145_0073_0000$$$::"Ah, some mongrels yet remain."[lr]::
15890::$$$message_0145_0073_0001$$$::He glances toward the house, annoyed.[lr]::
15891::$$$message_0145_0073_0002$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
15892::$$$message_0145_0073_0003$$$::I look...and see Tohsaka and Illya on the veranda in front of the living room.::
15893::$$$message_0145_0074_0000$$$::"What is that...?"[lr]::
15894::$$$message_0145_0074_0001$$$::Illya looks up at the man like she's just seen a ghost.[lr]::
15895::$$$message_0145_0074_0002$$$::She strains her eyes for a moment, then shakes her head in disbelief.::
15896::$$$message_0145_0075_0000$$$::"No way...who are you?"[lr]::
15897::$$$message_0145_0075_0001$$$::"Hm? Can't you tell, fool? I am one of the Heroic Spirits you know so well."[lr]::
15898::$$$message_0145_0075_0002$$$::"You can't be!!!"[lr]::
15899::$$$message_0145_0075_0003$$$::Illy jumps off the veranda and glares at the man as if in challenge.::
15900::$$$message_0145_0076_0000$$$::"I don't know...I don't know you! There shouldn't be a Servant I don't know about!!!"::
15901::$$$message_0145_0077_0000$$$::"Wha..!? Wait, Illya!"[lr]::
15902::$$$message_0145_0077_0001$$$::My words don't reach her.[lr]::
15903::$$$message_0145_0077_0002$$$::Illya releases a mass of magical energy straight at the man.::
15904::$$$message_0145_0078_0000$$$::I hear it rushing through the air.[lr]::
15905::$$$message_0145_0078_0001$$$::He does nothing.[lr]::
15906::$$$message_0145_0078_0002$$$::A mirrored shield appears in front of him and reflects Illya's attack back at her.::
15907::$$$message_0145_0079_0000$$$::"Eh...?"[lr]::
15908::$$$message_0145_0079_0001$$$::She'd been so blind and desperate in her attack that now she has no time to react to it.[lr]::
15909::$$$message_0145_0079_0002$$$::Illya can only stand there as her attack rebounds toward her.::
15910::$$$message_0145_0080_0000$$$::"Ungh...that hurt..."[lr]::
15911::$$$message_0145_0080_0001$$$::Tohsaka steps in and saves her, blocking the attack.::
15912::$$$message_0145_0081_0000$$$::"Hm. I see. So we have an odd one this time around.[lr]::
15913::$$$message_0145_0081_0001$$$::I see they've done a bit of creative thinking to avoid repeating their mistake last time."[lr]::
15914::$$$message_0145_0081_0002$$$::He looks down at Illya, scrutinizing her.[lr]::
15915::$$$message_0145_0081_0003$$$::He looks at Illya the same way he looks at Saber...coldly, as though appraising prized possessions.::
15916::$$$message_0145_0082_0000$$$::"No...no, no, no, no, NO! I hate you!"[lr]::
15917::$$$message_0145_0082_0001$$$::Illya glares at the man while Tohsaka tries to hold her back.::
15918::$$$message_0145_0083_0000$$$::"I could not possibly care less. Come now, open yourself up. Quickly now. You are the fifth one, after all."[lr]::
15919::$$$message_0145_0083_0001$$$::He says it so simply.[lr]::
15920::$$$message_0145_0083_0002$$$::I'm not sure why that had any effect on her.[lr]::
15921::$$$message_0145_0083_0003$$$::"Ah...n...no..."[lr]::
15922::$$$message_0145_0083_0004$$$::Illya trembles violently, then slumps to the ground.::
15923::$$$message_0145_0084_0000$$$::That's it.[lr]::
15924::$$$message_0145_0084_0001$$$::Nothing else can happen.[lr]::
15925::$$$message_0145_0084_0002$$$::Tohsaka and I can only look up at the man.[lr]::
15926::$$$message_0145_0084_0003$$$::We completely understand.[lr]::
15927::$$$message_0145_0084_0004$$$::He's not looking at us.[lr]::
15928::$$$message_0145_0084_0005$$$::If either of us so much as speaks up, we'll meet the same fate as Caster.::
15929::$$$message_0145_0085_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15930::$$$message_0145_0085_0001$$$::But not Saber.[lr]::
15931::$$$message_0145_0085_0002$$$::Her silence as she stares up at the golden knight is entirely different than ours.::
15932::$$$message_0145_0086_0000$$$::"How and why have you manifested, Archer?"[lr]::
15933::$$$message_0145_0086_0001$$$::Saber tries to keep her voice under control.[lr]::
15934::$$$message_0145_0086_0002$$$::Tohsaka and I can only gasp in surprise.::
15935::$$$message_0145_0087_0000$$$::"I require no reason. The Holy Grail is mine. What reason could I need to collect what is mine?"[lr]::
15936::$$$message_0145_0087_0001$$$::"Nonsense. You are not that kind of hero. Or rather..."::
15937::$$$message_0145_0088_0000$$$::"Stop. Another word and you will be forced to fight, King of Knights.[lr]::
15938::$$$message_0145_0088_0001$$$::I intended to do so, but I've lost interest. This place is too unsightly. It is not fit to celebrate our reunion."::
15939::$$$message_0145_0089_0000$$$::And with that, the man in gold turns away.[lr]::
15940::$$$message_0145_0089_0001$$$::He turns his back to us as if to demonstrate that we are no threat.[lr]::
15941::$$$message_0145_0089_0002$$$::"We shall meet again, Saber.[lr]::
15942::$$$message_0145_0089_0003$$$::My decision remains unchanged since our last meeting. Be prepared to make your choice by the time we next meet."::
15943::$$$message_0145_0090_0000$$$::He disappears.[lr]::
15944::$$$message_0145_0090_0001$$$::The tension fades, and the yard returns to the usual tranquility.[lr]::
15945::$$$message_0145_0090_0002$$$::But it's the only thing that returns to how it was.[lr]::
15946::$$$message_0145_0090_0003$$$::The Emiya house is in shambles, and Illya has fainted.[lr]::
15947::$$$message_0145_0090_0004$$$::And Saber, still with her back to us, remains silent.::!ã
