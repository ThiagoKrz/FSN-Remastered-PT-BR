33765::$$$message_0273_0000_0000$$$::    I'll protect Tohsaka.[lr]::
33766::$$$message_0273_0000_0001$$$::Saber isn't dead yet.[lr]::
33767::$$$message_0273_0000_0002$$$::Even if Kuzuki was an unexpected monster, Saber still hasn't lost yet.[lr]::
33768::$$$message_0273_0000_0003$$$::On top of that, Caster shouldn't be able to finish Saber off. ::
33769::$$$message_0273_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33770::$$$message_0273_0001_0001$$$::I tighten my grip on the bokutou in my hand.[lr]::
33771::$$$message_0273_0001_0002$$$::My eyes lock on Kuzuki to miss not even a blink.[lr]::
33772::$$$message_0273_0001_0003$$$::The moment he turns toward Tohsaka, I'll move between them.[lr]::
33773::$$$message_0273_0001_0004$$$::Knowing Tohsaka, I'm sure she's going to leap to the side and shoot Kuzuki[line2]::
33774::$$$message_0273_0002_0000$$$::"Ahh...!"[lr]::
33775::$$$message_0273_0002_0001$$$::There was no time to take action.[lr]::
33776::$$$message_0273_0002_0002$$$::It was in an instant.[lr]::
33777::$$$message_0273_0002_0003$$$::The moment I thought Kuzuki's body wavered, he was in front of Tohsaka.::
33778::$$$message_0273_0003_0000$$$::Tohsaka is astonished, but she immediately points her hand at Kuzuki.[lr]::
33779::$$$message_0273_0003_0001$$$::And the right hand of the enemy...[lr]::
33780::$$$message_0273_0003_0002$$$::The hand that wrecked Saber's neck strikes her in the chest.::
33781::$$$message_0273_0004_0000$$$::"Agh... Guh...!"[lr]::
33782::$$$message_0273_0004_0001$$$::Time seems to stop.[lr]::
33783::$$$message_0273_0004_0002$$$::All of the air in Tohsaka's lungs goes out from that blow.::
33784::$$$message_0273_0005_0000$$$::This is it.[lr]::
33785::$$$message_0273_0005_0001$$$::If a mage can't breathe, they can't cast a spell incantation or carry out most of their abilities.[lr]::
33786::$$$message_0273_0005_0002$$$::Though as she just barely managed to leap back, it seems she only had the wind knocked out of her.::
33787::$$$message_0273_0006_0000$$$::But the next attack...[lr]::
33788::$$$message_0273_0006_0001$$$::Even though she jumped back, it was only a meter or so.[lr]::
33789::$$$message_0273_0006_0002$$$::Such a distance...[lr]::
33790::$$$message_0273_0006_0003$$$::...is inconsequential to someone like Kuzuki!::
33791::$$$message_0273_0007_0000$$$::"Khh...!"[lr]::
33792::$$$message_0273_0007_0001$$$::I move in between them.[lr]::
33793::$$$message_0273_0007_0002$$$::Using my wooden sword as a shield, I plant myself between attacker and prey.[lr]::
33794::$$$message_0273_0007_0003$$$::He thrusts his fist.::
33795::$$$message_0273_0008_0000$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
33796::$$$message_0273_0008_0001$$$::I can't even see it...!?[lr]::
33797::$$$message_0273_0008_0002$$$::How did Saber dodge something like this[line2][lr]::
33798::$$$message_0273_0008_0003$$$::"Agh... Guh...!"[lr]::
33799::$$$message_0273_0008_0004$$$::I desperately protect my left side.::
33800::$$$message_0273_0009_0000$$$::A heavy striking sound follows, along with the sound of my sword snapping.[lr]::
33801::$$$message_0273_0009_0001$$$::I see Kuzuki coming with his next attack.::
33802::$$$message_0273_0010_0000$$$::    I'm going to die.[lr]::
33803::$$$message_0273_0010_0001$$$::Instinctively I know it's coming.[lr]::
33804::$$$message_0273_0010_0002$$$::The Strengthened wooden sword was the same as steel.[lr]::
33805::$$$message_0273_0010_0003$$$::If he can destroy that with one blow, then he can destroy my body no matter where he hits me.::
33806::$$$message_0273_0011_0000$$$::    I can't stop him.[lr]::
33807::$$$message_0273_0011_0001$$$::Tohsaka is coughing painfully behind me.[lr]::
33808::$$$message_0273_0011_0002$$$::I can't see his attacks, and my only weapon was destroyed.::
33809::$$$message_0273_0012_0000$$$::His fist aims precisely for my temple.[lr]::
33810::$$$message_0273_0012_0001$$$::Shirou Emiya will die from that hammer-like blow.::
33811::$$$message_0273_0013_0000$$$::    I'll die if I don't stop it.[lr]::
33812::$$$message_0273_0013_0001$$$::A weapon.[lr]::
33813::$$$message_0273_0013_0002$$$::I'm no match for him.[lr]::
33814::$$$message_0273_0013_0003$$$::I need a strong weapon to make up for the difference in our strength.::
33815::$$$message_0273_0014_0000$$$::It closes in on my brain.[lr]::
33816::$$$message_0273_0014_0001$$$::I imagine myself dying.[lr]::
33817::$$$message_0273_0014_0002$$$::No. If that happens...::
33818::$$$message_0273_0015_0000$$$::    I will end up dead if I can't stop it.[lr]::
33819::$$$message_0273_0015_0001$$$::A weapon. I need a weapon.[lr]::
33820::$$$message_0273_0015_0002$$$::A weapon that won't get destroyed by him. Not a wooden sword taken in haste, but a proven, strong weapon.[lr]::
33821::$$$message_0273_0015_0003$$$::An extraordinary weapon beyond my ken, yeah, like the ones he uses[line2]::
33822::$$$message_0273_0016_0000$$$::"...[font italic=true]Trace, on (Projection, start).[font italic=false]"[lr]::
33823::$$$message_0273_0016_0001$$$::Then I'll make them. I'll make them even if it's impossible. I'll make them at any cost.[lr]::
33824::$$$message_0273_0016_0002$$$::Strengthening and reproducing, something that does exist and something that doesn't...I'll force myself to believe that they're exactly the same.::
33825::$$$message_0273_0017_0000$$$::I don't have time. I can't overthink it. Fake it no matter what.[lr]::
33826::$$$message_0273_0017_0001$$$::I don't care if I break or lose something in the process, faster, I don't care if it's fake, hurry, forget it all, I'm not the only life at stake here, if I don't hurry, if I can't stop it, Tohsaka will...!!!::
33827::$$$message_0273_0018_0000$$$::"Huh? No way...!?"[lr]::
33828::$$$message_0273_0018_0001$$$::A sight beyond hope.[lr]::
33829::$$$message_0273_0018_0002$$$::Tohsaka speaks for me.::
33830::$$$message_0273_0019_0000$$$::"Nnng..."[lr]::
33831::$$$message_0273_0019_0001$$$::A muffled voice.[lr]::
33832::$$$message_0273_0019_0002$$$::Was that Kuzuki?[lr]::
33833::$$$message_0273_0019_0003$$$::Something might've happened to my ears; I can't hear properly.::
33834::$$$message_0273_0020_0000$$$::No, not just my ears, but the sensation in my limbs is numb.[lr]::
33835::$$$message_0273_0020_0001$$$::Only my right eye is functioning adequately.[lr]::
33836::$$$message_0273_0020_0002$$$::I see Kuzuki's approaching fist.[lr]::
33837::$$$message_0273_0020_0003$$$::It's like watching someone else block it.::
33838::$$$message_0273_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33839::$$$message_0273_0021_0001$$$::My arms feel hollow.[lr]::
33840::$$$message_0273_0021_0002$$$::I don't have any sensation in them, but I swear I can hear my nerves fraying.::
33841::$$$message_0273_0022_0000$$$::His twin swords are in my hands.[lr]::
33842::$$$message_0273_0022_0001$$$::The Yang Kanshou and Yin Bakuya.[lr]::
33843::$$$message_0273_0022_0002$$$::The name of the swords.[lr]::
33844::$$$message_0273_0022_0003$$$::Even though they were reproduced haphazardly, the swords still present themselves to their owner.::
33845::$$$message_0273_0023_0000$$$::    But, I'm sorry.[lr]::
33846::$$$message_0273_0023_0001$$$::I can't Project you perfectly with my skills.::
33847::$$$message_0273_0024_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
33848::$$$message_0273_0024_0001$$$::"..."::
33849::$$$message_0273_0025_0000$$$::We spring apart.[lr]::
33850::$$$message_0273_0025_0001$$$::The twin swords that parried thirty strikes shatter, as if to say they can't take anymore.[lr]::
33851::$$$message_0273_0025_0002$$$::It's not because they lost to Kuzuki's fists.[lr]::
33852::$$$message_0273_0025_0003$$$::The twin swords disappeared because I couldn't maintain my image of them.::
33853::$$$message_0273_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33854::$$$message_0273_0026_0001$$$::The twin swords must've been unexpected, as Kuzuki shows hesitation for the first time.[lr]::
33855::$$$message_0273_0026_0002$$$::Then...[lr]::
33856::$$$message_0273_0026_0003$$$::A strong wind stirs up in the intersection.::
33857::$$$message_0273_0027_0000$$$::"Saber...!"[lr]::
33858::$$$message_0273_0027_0001$$$::I look toward the wall.[lr]::
33859::$$$message_0273_0027_0002$$$::Saber must've recovered, as she stands.[lr]::
33860::$$$message_0273_0027_0003$$$::Caster, in front of her, rapidly steps back.::
33861::$$$message_0273_0028_0000$$$::...Yes, that's why it was a mistake.[lr]::
33862::$$$message_0273_0028_0001$$$::Just because she was defeated, it didn't mean that she lost her powers. So there's no way Saber, with strong Magic Resistance, could be cornered by Caster.[lr]::
33863::$$$message_0273_0028_0002$$$::It's Kuzuki's role to finish Saber off.[lr]::
33864::$$$message_0273_0028_0003$$$::Despite that, Caster made a mistake.[lr]::
33865::$$$message_0273_0028_0004$$$::She seemed to be planning something, but that excessiveness cost her the chance of victory.::
33866::$$$message_0273_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33867::$$$message_0273_0029_0001$$$::Kuzuki retreats.[lr]::
33868::$$$message_0273_0029_0002$$$::He stands protective of Caster and as a ward against Saber.[lr]::
33869::$$$message_0273_0029_0003$$$::"This is it. We'll retreat, Caster."[lr]::
33870::$$$message_0273_0029_0004$$$::He makes an apt decision.::
33871::$$$message_0273_0030_0000$$$::"Master...!? No, Saber is injured. You should be able to defeat her again like before!"[lr]::
33872::$$$message_0273_0030_0001$$$::"She is not someone who will fall for it twice. I am the one who underestimated her.[lr]::
33873::$$$message_0273_0030_0002$$$::I should have struck her once more."::
33874::$$$message_0273_0031_0000$$$::...Kuzuki is correct.[lr]::
33875::$$$message_0273_0031_0001$$$::Saber was cornered because Kuzuki's attacks were unnatural.[lr]::
33876::$$$message_0273_0031_0002$$$::But that was before.[lr]::
33877::$$$message_0273_0031_0003$$$::I wouldn't be able to deal with them no matter how many times I saw them, but Saber is already used to them.::
33878::$$$message_0273_0032_0000$$$::Tactics are supposed to be unknown to an opponent.[lr]::
33879::$$$message_0273_0032_0001$$$::Kuzuki's attacks are powerful, but since they are so unique, their exposure renders future attacks followable. [lr]::
33880::$$$message_0273_0032_0002$$$::The first strike must be fatal.[lr]::
33881::$$$message_0273_0032_0003$$$::The difference between skills that have been polished to an art form,[lr]::
33882::$$$message_0273_0032_0004$$$::and a single move that has been trained to the utmost limits.::
33883::$$$message_0273_0033_0000$$$::"...I understand, Souichirou.[lr]::
33884::$$$message_0273_0033_0001$$$::Yes, as long as I am a Servant, I must obey my Master's order."[lr]::
33885::$$$message_0273_0033_0002$$$::Who was that directed to?[lr]::
33886::$$$message_0273_0033_0003$$$::She spits in disgust and flutters her robe dramatically.::
33887::$$$message_0273_0034_0000$$$::...There is nothing after that.[lr]::
33888::$$$message_0273_0034_0001$$$::After the indigo robe wraps around Kuzuki's body, they vanish from the intersection like magic.::
