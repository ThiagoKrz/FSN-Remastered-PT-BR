68289::$$$message_0629_0000_0000$$$::Purification by holy word.[lr]::
68290::$$$message_0629_0000_0001$$$::The priest's exorcism dispersed Zouken Matou's spiritual body.[lr]::
68291::$$$message_0629_0000_0002$$$::Only two men are left in the clearing: [lr]::
68292::$$$message_0629_0000_0003$$$::Kirei Kotomine leans against a wall, bloody and battered, his robes stained red.[lr]::
68293::$$$message_0629_0000_0004$$$::Assassin is pinned to a tree by Black Keys.::
68294::$$$message_0629_0001_0000$$$::"You completely erased my Lord Mage, Executor. Did you know he was a swarm of insects?"[lr]::
68295::$$$message_0629_0001_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68296::$$$message_0629_0001_0002$$$::He turns to face the voice.[lr]::
68297::$$$message_0629_0001_0003$$$::Assassin is gone.[lr]::
68298::$$$message_0629_0001_0004$$$::Only a blood stain and the Black Keys remain embedded in the tree.::
68299::$$$message_0629_0002_0000$$$::"...He and I go back a ways. I knew that he was a spirit who uses insects to interact with the world. Physical injury is ineffective. The only way to kill him would be to crush every trace of his body."::
68300::$$$message_0629_0003_0000$$$::"So you attacked his spiritual body, instead.[lr]::
68301::$$$message_0629_0003_0001$$$::He was quite attached to his mortality, but it made him vulnerable to the words of Scripture.[lr]::
68302::$$$message_0629_0003_0002$$$::So that is why they call you an exorcist. You are Zouken Matou's natural enemy."::
68303::$$$message_0629_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68304::$$$message_0629_0004_0001$$$::The priest doesn't answer. He checks his injuries.[lr]::
68305::$$$message_0629_0004_0002$$$::His bleeding has stopped.[lr]::
68306::$$$message_0629_0004_0003$$$::He's lost his weapons, but he isn't critically wounded. A few minutes' rest should be enough to recover his strength.::
68307::$$$message_0629_0005_0000$$$::"What will you do now, Assassin? Your Master is gone. Even my prayers would prove effective against you, without his magical energy to support you."[lr]::
68308::$$$message_0629_0005_0001$$$::"...Indeed. My body will soon fade away. Unless I find a replacement Master, I am little different from the spirits wandering these woods. In less than a day, I will regress into a lesser spirit and disappear from this world."::
68309::$$$message_0629_0006_0000$$$::"That's right. Even an Executor such as myself can harm a Master-less Servant.[lr]::
68310::$$$message_0629_0006_0001$$$::So, what now? Will you avenge your fallen lord?"[lr]::
68311::$$$message_0629_0006_0002$$$::"I am not that impulsive. The Lord Mage was defeated by his own arrogance. It was no failure of mine.[lr]::
68312::$$$message_0629_0006_0003$$$::There are still some things which do not make sense to me. I must know more about them."::
68313::$$$message_0629_0007_0000$$$::"You mean how Zabaniya failed?[lr]::
68314::$$$message_0629_0007_0001$$$::Your arm appears to be from a shaytan, but since you graced it with the name of a fallen angel, it cannot affect me.[lr]::
68315::$$$message_0629_0007_0002$$$::As something that punishes humans, it cannot curse something of its own kind... I am no longer a man, and my heart is extraordinarily resistant to curses."::
68316::$$$message_0629_0008_0000$$$::"...I knew it. Your heart is just like that girl's.[lr]::
68317::$$$message_0629_0008_0001$$$::Have you already been tainted...?"[lr]::
68318::$$$message_0629_0008_0002$$$::The priest doesn't answer.[lr]::
68319::$$$message_0629_0008_0003$$$::His lips only curl into a sardonic smile.::
68320::$$$message_0629_0009_0000$$$::"But how did you know? You would only have acted the way you did if you knew my arm would not affect you.[lr]::
68321::$$$message_0629_0009_0001$$$::Did you intend to make me use my Noble Phantasm from the start?"[lr]::
68322::$$$message_0629_0009_0002$$$::"Yes. I knew about your arm already, Assassin.[lr]::
68323::$$$message_0629_0009_0003$$$::It is a cursed arm which creates an identical image of your target's heart and swaps it with the real heart by treating it as a mirror existence.[lr]::
68324::$$$message_0629_0009_0004$$$::It is what killed my Servant."::
68325::$$$message_0629_0010_0000$$$::"...! Then, you..."[lr]::
68326::$$$message_0629_0010_0001$$$::"Yes, I was watching until his final moments.[lr]::
68327::$$$message_0629_0010_0002$$$::So of course I knew. Your loss was decided the moment you killed Lancer."[lr]::
68328::$$$message_0629_0010_0003$$$::"...Tch. What a failure."[lr]::
68329::$$$message_0629_0010_0004$$$::Assassin clicks his tongue with loathing.[lr]::
68330::$$$message_0629_0010_0005$$$::He dismisses his bloodlust.[lr]::
68331::$$$message_0629_0010_0006$$$::Disappointed, he leaves. The priest's response seems to have satisfied his curiosity.::
68332::$$$message_0629_0011_0000$$$::"...Gone to look for a new contractor, I see.[lr]::
68333::$$$message_0629_0011_0001$$$::He will most likely serve Sakura Matou next..."[lr]::
68334::$$$message_0629_0011_0002$$$::The priest has no problem with that.[lr]::
68335::$$$message_0629_0011_0003$$$::As long as Zouken Matou doesn't kill Sakura Matou, he doesn't care.::
68336::$$$message_0629_0012_0000$$$::Zouken wishes for immortality.[lr]::
68337::$$$message_0629_0012_0001$$$::Obtaining Sakura's body will satisfy that desire.[lr]::
68338::$$$message_0629_0012_0002$$$::As long as the old man is alive, the curse gestating within the Holy Grail will never be born.[lr]::
68339::$$$message_0629_0012_0003$$$::It would be meaningless to have Sakura become an insect's vessel after she has grown this much.[lr]::
68340::$$$message_0629_0012_0004$$$::He needs her to keep being a Master.[lr]::
68341::$$$message_0629_0012_0005$$$::Because...::
68342::$$$message_0629_0013_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"Yes, there will be no eternity for you.[font italic=false][lr]::
68343::$$$message_0629_0013_0001$$$::[font italic=true]You were flawed from the moment you were born."[font italic=false]::
68344::$$$message_0629_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68345::$$$message_0629_0014_0001$$$::He feels slightly dizzy when he stands up.[lr]::
68346::$$$message_0629_0014_0002$$$::He must be exhausted.[lr]::
68347::$$$message_0629_0014_0003$$$::The priest leans against a wall, and sleepily closes his eyes for a time.::
68348::$$$message_0629_0015_0000$$$::It happened ten years ago.::
68349::$$$message_0629_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"Flawed from the moment you were born."[font italic=false][r]::
68350::$$$message_0629_0016_0001$$$::The man tried many things after he realized this truth.[lr]::
68351::$$$message_0629_0016_0002$$$::In his youth, he did not understand morals, but he did possess common sense. He attempted to overcome this flaw.[lr]::
68352::$$$message_0629_0016_0003$$$::But it was not to be.[lr]::
68353::$$$message_0629_0016_0004$$$::His pain and struggle ended in failure.[lr]::
68354::$$$message_0629_0016_0005$$$::His last effort was a woman.::
68355::$$$message_0629_0017_0000$$$::It was a simple tale.[lr]::
68356::$$$message_0629_0017_0001$$$::Any human dreams of loving someone of the opposite sex, having a family, and dying a peaceful death.[lr]::
68357::$$$message_0629_0017_0002$$$::No one spurns that peace or fails to dream of it.[lr]::
68358::$$$message_0629_0017_0003$$$::He was no exception.[lr]::
68359::$$$message_0629_0017_0004$$$::Even if it didn't appeal to him at all, he decided that it would be nice to have,[lr]::
68360::$$$message_0629_0017_0005$$$::and he loved a woman to obtain some measure of human-like happiness.::
68361::$$$message_0629_0018_0000$$$::He chose a woman with no future.[lr]::
68362::$$$message_0629_0018_0001$$$::She was ill, with only years left to live.[lr]::
68363::$$$message_0629_0018_0002$$$::Did he choose her because of that, or because he had no other choice?[lr]::
68364::$$$message_0629_0018_0003$$$::Even now, he's not sure why.::
68365::$$$message_0629_0019_0000$$$::They spent about two years together.[lr]::
68366::$$$message_0629_0019_0001$$$::The man tried to love the woman.[lr]::
68367::$$$message_0629_0019_0002$$$::The woman did her best to love him back, and she gave him a child.[lr]::
68368::$$$message_0629_0019_0003$$$::But the outcome did not change.[lr]::
68369::$$$message_0629_0019_0004$$$::The man found happiness in his woman's suffering and his child's despair.[lr]::
68370::$$$message_0629_0019_0005$$$::The more he tried to love her, the more she suffered. To him, it was the only saving grace of their bond.::
68371::$$$message_0629_0020_0000$$$::The contradiction did not bother him. He is not even sure if he suffered.[lr]::
68372::$$$message_0629_0020_0001$$$::But the more the woman tried to soothe him, the more he found himself wanting to see her grief.::
68373::$$$message_0629_0021_0000$$$::She was a saint. She was frail, but he would have called her a saint.[lr]::
68374::$$$message_0629_0021_0001$$$::It need not be said how profound her faith was, and how well she understood his rage.[lr]::
68375::$$$message_0629_0021_0002$$$::That is why he nearly despaired.[lr]::
68376::$$$message_0629_0021_0003$$$::He would never again meet someone who understood him so well and tried to heal him. But even this woman could not fill the void within him.::
68377::$$$message_0629_0022_0000$$$::So, there was no need to question his life any longer.[lr]::
68378::$$$message_0629_0022_0001$$$::He was born flawed.[lr]::
68379::$$$message_0629_0022_0002$$$::His birth was a mistake.[lr]::
68380::$$$message_0629_0022_0003$$$::He concluded that if he was a mistake, then he should disappear. He went to part ways with the woman before his death.[lr]::
68381::$$$message_0629_0022_0004$$$::He married her as an experiment, so he was obligated to let her know it was over.::
68382::$$$message_0629_0023_0000$$$::The woman loved Kotomine.[lr]::
68383::$$$message_0629_0023_0001$$$::Kotomine tried to love her, too.[lr]::
68384::$$$message_0629_0023_0002$$$::That's all there was to it.::
68385::$$$message_0629_0024_0000$$$::The end came all too quickly.[lr]::
68386::$$$message_0629_0024_0001$$$::"I could not love you."[lr]::
68387::$$$message_0629_0024_0002$$$::He told her, in a room surrounded by stone walls.[lr]::
68388::$$$message_0629_0024_0003$$$::The woman smiled on her deathbed. Her body, all skin and bones, could not even stand anymore.[lr]::
68389::$$$message_0629_0024_0004$$$::"...No. You do love me."[lr]::
68390::$$$message_0629_0024_0005$$$::Then she smiled, and ended her own life.::
68391::$$$message_0629_0025_0000$$$::He didn't try to stop her. There would have been no point in doing so.[lr]::
68392::$$$message_0629_0025_0001$$$::The woman had a terminal illness. She would have died sooner or later. He knew that when he chose her.::
68393::$$$message_0629_0026_0000$$$::As her consciousness faded, the blood-soaked woman looked up at the man and laughed.[lr]::
68394::$$$message_0629_0026_0001$$$::"See? You're crying, dear."[lr]::
68395::$$$message_0629_0026_0002$$$::Of course, he didn't shed a single tear.[lr]::
68396::$$$message_0629_0026_0003$$$::He only looked that way to her.[lr]::
68397::$$$message_0629_0026_0004$$$::With her death, the woman proved to him that he could love someone, and that his life was worth living.[lr]::
68398::$$$message_0629_0026_0005$$$::He left the room without saying another word, and abandoned the Lord's teachings.::
68399::$$$message_0629_0027_0000$$$::...Yes.[lr]::
68400::$$$message_0629_0027_0001$$$::He did think it was sad.[lr]::
68401::$$$message_0629_0027_0002$$$::But not because she died.[lr]::
68402::$$$message_0629_0027_0003$$$::In that moment, he thought...[lr]::
68403::$$$message_0629_0027_0004$$$::"What a shame. If she was going to die anyway, I wish I could have killed her myself."[r][wsay canskip=1]::
68404::$$$message_0629_0027_0005$$$::He did not mourn her death, but lamented the fact that he couldn't enjoy it.::
68405::$$$message_0629_0028_0000$$$::    It happened a long time ago.[lr]::
68406::$$$message_0629_0028_0001$$$::He can't remember her face anymore, never mind her voice.[lr]::
68407::$$$message_0629_0028_0002$$$::But sometimes, he thinks...[lr]::
68408::$$$message_0629_0028_0003$$$::"I wish I could have killed her myself."[lr]::
68409::$$$message_0629_0028_0004$$$::Would that have brought him joy?[lr]::
68410::$$$message_0629_0028_0005$$$::Or was it because he loved her that he was sorry he couldn't kill her?::
68411::$$$message_0629_0029_0000$$$::He would sever that train of thought whenever he found himself dwelling on it.[lr]::
68412::$$$message_0629_0029_0001$$$::That question should be left to eternity.[lr]::
68413::$$$message_0629_0029_0002$$$::The woman's death was meaningless,[lr]::
68414::$$$message_0629_0029_0003$$$::because her devotion failed to change him.[lr]::
68415::$$$message_0629_0029_0004$$$::But he did not want it to be worthless.[lr]::
68416::$$$message_0629_0029_0005$$$::   He would never try to answer that question.::
68417::$$$message_0629_0030_0000$$$::...It happened a long, long time ago.[lr]::
68418::$$$message_0629_0030_0001$$$::It was the memory of a man nourished by the misfortune of others, who found fulfillment in the world's corruption.[lr]::
68419::$$$message_0629_0030_0002$$$::After that, the man met his archnemesis.[lr]::
68420::$$$message_0629_0030_0003$$$::Kiritsugu Emiya.[lr]::
68421::$$$message_0629_0030_0004$$$::A mage who chose to invalidate everything the man might have wanted for himself...::
68422::$$$message_0629_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68423::$$$message_0629_0031_0001$$$::The priest opens his eyes.[lr]::
68424::$$$message_0629_0031_0002$$$::It seems he was asleep for a while.[lr]::
68425::$$$message_0629_0031_0003$$$::After confirming that his strength has returned, he begins walking to catch up to Shirou Emiya[line2]::
68426::$$$message_0629_0032_0000$$$::"You're not going anywhere.[lr]::
68427::$$$message_0629_0032_0001$$$::No, you're going to die right here."::
68428::$$$message_0629_0033_0000$$$::A girl blocks his path.::
68429::$$$message_0629_0034_0000$$$::She has completely changed.[lr]::
68430::$$$message_0629_0034_0001$$$::She is clothed in her own shadow.[lr]::
68431::$$$message_0629_0034_0002$$$::Her dark magical energy cloaks her like a part of her own body.[lr]::
68432::$$$message_0629_0034_0003$$$::  The sheer amount of her magical energy and her existence are no longer that of a human's.[lr]::
68433::$$$message_0629_0034_0004$$$::Her spiritual caliber has now reached the level of a pure Heroic Spirit, a Counter Guardian.::
68434::$$$message_0629_0035_0000$$$::"...You've been completely corrupted, Sakura Matou.[lr]::
68435::$$$message_0629_0035_0001$$$::Not just in body[line2]you could not have transformed this much without adapting your mind to the curse.[lr]::
68436::$$$message_0629_0035_0002$$$::   So you've accepted that you are a monster, now."[lr]::
68437::$$$message_0629_0035_0003$$$::The priest denounces her, even though he wished for it.[lr]::
68438::$$$message_0629_0035_0004$$$::He scolds her for becoming drunk on her own power.::
68439::$$$message_0629_0036_0000$$$::"...Heh. And what's wrong with that?[lr]::
68440::$$$message_0629_0036_0001$$$::But I didn't have any other choice, you know.[lr]::
68441::$$$message_0629_0036_0002$$$::Maybe I could have held out a little longer if people had been nicer to me."[lr]::
68442::$$$message_0629_0036_0003$$$::"Oh? Held out against what?"::
68443::$$$message_0629_0037_0000$$$::"Myself, Father.[lr]::
68444::$$$message_0629_0037_0001$$$::I've finally accepted that I hate the world.[lr]::
68445::$$$message_0629_0037_0002$$$::The Tohsaka family who abandoned me. My sister who's different from me in every way, living a free life. My scary grandfather and my pitiful brother. This whole town that doesn't know my suffering."::
68446::$$$message_0629_0038_0000$$$::"I can't forgive any of them.[lr]::
68447::$$$message_0629_0038_0001$$$::...I know I'm just taking my anger out on them. But I can't help but imagine this, even though I know it's wrong...[lr]::
68448::$$$message_0629_0038_0002$$$::...Yes.[lr]::
68449::$$$message_0629_0038_0003$$$::I wonder what faces they'll make when I teach everyone who's never helped me what it's like to be me."::
68450::$$$message_0629_0039_0000$$$::The girl smiles in grim delight.[lr]::
68451::$$$message_0629_0039_0001$$$::The priest is unaffected.[lr]::
68452::$$$message_0629_0039_0002$$$::He looks at the girl like something dirty.::
68453::$$$message_0629_0040_0000$$$::"You've changed, Sakura Matou... I see. Your nature was suited to the darkness."[lr]::
68454::$$$message_0629_0040_0001$$$::"Yes, I've changed. I'm not the old Sakura Matou anymore. That weak girl is gone.[lr]::
68455::$$$message_0629_0040_0002$$$::Everyone's always made me suffer. I'm just making them feel the same way. The girl who used to just put up with everything is gone."::
68456::$$$message_0629_0041_0000$$$::She giggles.[lr]::
68457::$$$message_0629_0041_0001$$$::Multiple personalities.[lr]::
68458::$$$message_0629_0041_0002$$$::Sakura Matou is gone, replaced by a separate personality that was sleeping within.[lr]::
68459::$$$message_0629_0041_0003$$$::It's the only explanation for her wildly different, charming attitude.[lr]::
68460::$$$message_0629_0041_0004$$$::But...[lr]::
68461::$$$message_0629_0041_0005$$$::"...What do you mean? There's no need to hide it, Sakura Matou."[lr]::
68462::$$$message_0629_0041_0006$$$::The priest denies her with a blunt sentence.::
68463::$$$message_0629_0042_0000$$$::"Huh? What do you..."[lr]::
68464::$$$message_0629_0042_0001$$$::"I said you don't need to hide it.[lr]::
68465::$$$message_0629_0042_0002$$$::You do not have a separate personality. You've become drunk on violence since the mud swallowed you, but you are still the same Sakura Matou. There's no need to invent a second personality as an excuse to show that you did nothing wrong."[lr]::
68466::$$$message_0629_0042_0003$$$::The girl's face stiffens.[lr]::
68467::$$$message_0629_0042_0004$$$::Is it true?[lr]::
68468::$$$message_0629_0042_0005$$$::The blackened girl grits her teeth and glares back at the priest.::
68469::$$$message_0629_0043_0000$$$::"What are you... You're the one who did this to me...!"[lr]::
68470::$$$message_0629_0043_0001$$$::Her shadows writhe in concert with her loathing.[lr]::
68471::$$$message_0629_0043_0002$$$::   They erode everything around her like a blaze.[lr]::
68472::$$$message_0629_0043_0003$$$::The speed with which her shadows covered the ground is nothing like before.::
68473::$$$message_0629_0044_0000$$$::"I won't deny it. I allowed you to live so that you could become its Master. You've splendidly lived up to my expectations, and now you're trying to give birth to Avenger.[lr]::
68474::$$$message_0629_0044_0001$$$::You've easily achieved something that I could not."::
68475::$$$message_0629_0045_0000$$$::"It wasn't easy! You have no idea how much I've suffered! How much it hurts even now!"[lr]::
68476::$$$message_0629_0045_0001$$$::"I don't know, nor do I need to know. I'm not eccentric enough to listen to a little girl's whining."::
68477::$$$message_0629_0046_0000$$$::"Rrgh... All right.[lr]::
68478::$$$message_0629_0046_0001$$$::That's fine. I don't want you to know, either.[lr]::
68479::$$$message_0629_0046_0002$$$::I won't let you have pity for me that easily, because from now on, I'm the one who's going to be showing everyone else."[lr]::
68480::$$$message_0629_0046_0003$$$::A cruel smile plays across her lips.::
68481::$$$message_0629_0047_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68482::$$$message_0629_0047_0001$$$::The priest doesn't hesitate to retreat.[lr]::
68483::$$$message_0629_0047_0002$$$::He moves with the same swiftness that caught Zouken Matou in midair.::
68484::$$$message_0629_0048_0000$$$::   He only takes one bound away.[lr]::
68485::$$$message_0629_0048_0001$$$::The girl is an amateur, despite her enormous magical power.[lr]::
68486::$$$message_0629_0048_0002$$$::He can easily get away from someone who lacks experience in both combat and magecraft.::
68487::$$$message_0629_0049_0000$$$::"...Foolish man. Did you really think you could run from me?"::
68488::$$$message_0629_0050_0000$$$::She snickers.[lr]::
68489::$$$message_0629_0050_0001$$$::Instantly, the priest goes limp and tumbles to the ground.::
68490::$$$message_0629_0051_0000$$$::"Guh...guoh...!"[lr]::
68491::$$$message_0629_0051_0001$$$::He tumbles down.[lr]::
68492::$$$message_0629_0051_0002$$$::Kirei Kotomine crumples, spewing something red from his mouth.[lr]::
68493::$$$message_0629_0051_0003$$$::"Hargh...nnrgh, guh...!"[lr]::
68494::$$$message_0629_0051_0004$$$::It doesn't stop.[lr]::
68495::$$$message_0629_0051_0005$$$::He keeps vomiting blood, and each time he tries to fill his lungs with air, he coughs more blood.::
68496::$$$message_0629_0052_0000$$$::"How does it feel to have someone grab your heart? Your life's in the palm of my hand no matter where you go, you know."[lr]::
68497::$$$message_0629_0052_0001$$$::"Nngh...guh...!"[lr]::
68498::$$$message_0629_0052_0002$$$::"Father, you died ten years ago. You died when Kiritsugu Emiya shot you through the heart. There's only one reason you've stuck around this long."::
68499::$$$message_0629_0053_0000$$$::"You're his... Um, who was he again? Some Servant I ate earlier. Well, his name doesn't matter.[lr]::
68500::$$$message_0629_0053_0001$$$::That golden man bathed in the contents of the Holy Grail and connected to that thing. But he couldn't be corrupted, so it flowed into his Master instead.[lr]::
68501::$$$message_0629_0053_0002$$$::That's how you came back to life.[lr]::
68502::$$$message_0629_0053_0003$$$::You escaped death because Avenger...because AÅ‹ra Mainiiu gave you some of its power." ::
68503::$$$message_0629_0054_0000$$$::"Heh. I see. And that was..."[lr]::
68504::$$$message_0629_0054_0001$$$::"Yes. You're connected to AÅ‹ra Mainiiu. But [font italic=true]I'm[font italic=false] AÅ‹ra Mainiiu now.[lr]::
68505::$$$message_0629_0054_0002$$$::So I crushed it for you. I destroyed the black heart that's been keeping you alive.[lr]::
68506::$$$message_0629_0054_0003$$$::If you want, I'll crush all your organs, too.[lr]::
68507::$$$message_0629_0054_0004$$$::My hands can rip out your insides, no matter where you go."::
68508::$$$message_0629_0055_0000$$$::The girl raises a hand.[lr]::
68509::$$$message_0629_0055_0001$$$::Her gracious offer isn't sincere at all.[lr]::
68510::$$$message_0629_0055_0002$$$::She has no intention of letting the priest leave alive.[lr]::
68511::$$$message_0629_0055_0003$$$::She'll just laugh and kill him if he begs for his life.[lr]::
68512::$$$message_0629_0055_0004$$$::She'll take back the temporary life that's sustained him.[lr]::
68513::$$$message_0629_0055_0005$$$::After all, it belongs to her.[lr]::
68514::$$$message_0629_0055_0006$$$::Even if the amount of magical energy he has is equivalent to a speck of dust in the corner of her bedroom, she doesn't need to let him have it.::
68515::$$$message_0629_0056_0000$$$::"Goodbye. I suppose I should thank you for saving my life before, Father."[lr]::
68516::$$$message_0629_0056_0001$$$::The girl's lovely fingers curl around an invisible doll.[lr]::
68517::$$$message_0629_0056_0002$$$::   There's a squeezing noise.[lr]::
68518::$$$message_0629_0056_0003$$$::The priest on the ground is wrung out like a rag.[lr]::
68519::$$$message_0629_0056_0004$$$::Just one more twist.[lr]::
68520::$$$message_0629_0056_0005$$$::In less than a second, the priest will die completely.[lr]::
68521::$$$message_0629_0056_0006$$$::But just before that...::
68522::$$$message_0629_0057_0000$$$::"Nngh...! Argh, urgh, ahh!?"[lr]::
68523::$$$message_0629_0057_0001$$$::The girl crumples to her knees.[lr]::
68524::$$$message_0629_0057_0002$$$::...She's savaged by nausea and discomfort.[lr]::
68525::$$$message_0629_0057_0003$$$::She claws at the blackened ground, as if pleading for help.::
68526::$$$message_0629_0058_0000$$$::"Kuh...It hurts, no, don't...come in...!"[lr]::
68527::$$$message_0629_0058_0001$$$::The shadows expand.[lr]::
68528::$$$message_0629_0058_0002$$$::Something must have happened. The black robe covering her body suddenly blooms, before returning to its original size.::
68529::$$$message_0629_0059_0000$$$::"No way...Berserker actually...lost..."[lr]::
68530::$$$message_0629_0059_0001$$$::There can't be any other reason.[lr]::
68531::$$$message_0629_0059_0002$$$::Berserker was defeated.[lr]::
68532::$$$message_0629_0059_0003$$$::With his death, the pure magical energy of his soul flowed into the girl, the Holy Grail.::
68533::$$$message_0629_0060_0000$$$::"...argh...Argh..."[lr]::
68534::$$$message_0629_0060_0001$$$::Her mind twists.[lr]::
68535::$$$message_0629_0060_0002$$$::Sakura Matou's personality is pushed further to the edge.[lr]::
68536::$$$message_0629_0060_0003$$$::...There shouldn't be any more room, but a massive soul has her pressed against a wall.::
68537::$$$message_0629_0061_0000$$$::"...Ah."[lr]::
68538::$$$message_0629_0061_0001$$$::...She'll disappear.[lr]::
68539::$$$message_0629_0061_0002$$$::She'll be gone for good.[lr]::
68540::$$$message_0629_0061_0003$$$::At this rate, Sakura Matou will disappear."[lr]::
68541::$$$message_0629_0061_0004$$$::"...Before...that..."[lr]::
68542::$$$message_0629_0061_0005$$$::She remembers she meant to kill the priest and looks up. She curses herself for being too slow to follow through.::
68543::$$$message_0629_0062_0000$$$::"Ngh... It's...fine. He'll die...even if I leave him..."[lr]::
68544::$$$message_0629_0062_0001$$$::The ruins are empty now.[lr]::
68545::$$$message_0629_0062_0002$$$::All that remains on the spot where Kirei Kotomine had been lying is his bloodied vestment.:(×ñ
