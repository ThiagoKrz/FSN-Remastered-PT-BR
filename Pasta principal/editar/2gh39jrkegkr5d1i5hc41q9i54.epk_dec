66065::$$$message_0611_0005_0000$$$::"You were just talking about how my seasoning style was fresh and novel. Do you actually not like spicy food, Shirou?"::

66091::$$$message_0611_0011_0001$$$::I search my memory.[lr]::
66092::$$$message_0611_0011_0002$$$::I frown for a bit before remembering that I did say I'd go shopping with Illya.::
66093::$$$message_0611_0012_0000$$$::"Yeah. Let's go, Illya."[lr]::
66094::$$$message_0611_0012_0001$$$::I shake my head and start walking.[lr]::

66097::$$$message_0611_0014_0000$$$::It's nothing compared to the pain I felt last night, and I'm in good physical condition.[lr]::
66098::$$$message_0611_0014_0001$$$::I got a little dizzy for a second there, but it doesn't pose a problem at all.::
