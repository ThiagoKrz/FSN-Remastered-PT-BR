66100::$$$message_0612_0000_0001$$$::I can't afford to go out shopping frequently anymore, so we'll have to stock up for about three days at a time.::
66101::$$$message_0612_0001_0000$$$::"Guess I'll buy a lot. Is there anything you want, Illya? I'm thinking about the lunch menu."::
66102::$$$message_0612_0002_0000$$$::"Weren't we going to have stew for lunch? You just said so earlier."[lr]::
66103::$$$message_0612_0002_0001$$$::"Oh... Right, I did. I just wanted to double check. Sakura likes white stews, so we'll look at some chicken."::
66104::$$$message_0612_0003_0000$$$::We head to the butcher's shop I usually visit.[lr]::
66105::$$$message_0612_0003_0001$$$::We're going to stock up for three days, in any case.[lr]::
66106::$$$message_0612_0003_0002$$$::I can't waste money, so I need to maximize value and quality.::
66107::$$$message_0612_0004_0000$$$::   We spend a brisk thirty minutes shopping.::
66108::$$$message_0612_0005_0000$$$::"Aha, you bought so much![lr]::
66109::$$$message_0612_0005_0001$$$::Illya looked bored while we were shopping, but she seemed to enjoy herself once I gave her some bags to hold.::
66110::$$$message_0612_0006_0000$$$::"...Sorry. I bought too much. Are the bags heavy for you?[lr]::
66111::$$$message_0612_0006_0001$$$::I can trade you for some lighter ones."[lr]::
66112::$$$message_0612_0006_0002$$$::I hand her the lightest grocery bag out of the seven I'm holding.::
66113::$$$message_0612_0007_0000$$$::"No, I'm okay. It isn't heavy.[lr]::
66114::$$$message_0612_0007_0001$$$::I can take one more, actually. You're holding so many in one hand, it looks like a bunch of grapes."::
66115::$$$message_0612_0008_0000$$$::"I'm okay too. That's a funny example, though."[lr]::
66116::$$$message_0612_0008_0001$$$::"Yeah. I was actually thinking you're like a clown holding a bunch of balloons, but grapes are cuter!"::
66117::$$$message_0612_0009_0000$$$::Illya runs through the street, talking happily.[lr]::
66118::$$$message_0612_0009_0001$$$::"Wait up, Illya. They aren't that heavy, but I can't really run right now."::
66119::$$$message_0612_0010_0000$$$::Rather than the weight, I'm afraid that the eggs and tofu in the bags might get crushed.[lr]::
66120::$$$message_0612_0010_0001$$$::I sigh and fast-walk after Illya.[lr]::
66121::$$$message_0612_0010_0002$$$::This is the greatest concession I can give as the designated grocery shopper.::
66122::$$$message_0612_0011_0000$$$::...And so I follow Illya, making a lot of noise as I hold my groceries carefully.[lr]::
66123::$$$message_0612_0011_0001$$$::That seems to tickle Illya, and she[lr]::
66124::$$$message_0612_0011_0002$$$::looks like she's having a lot of fun.::
66125::$$$message_0612_0012_0000$$$::Once we leave the shopping district and arrive at the intersection, Illya stops and turns to me.::

66130::$$$message_0612_0014_0000$$$::Illya starts singing, supermarket grocery bags in hand.[lr]::
66131::$$$message_0612_0014_0001$$$::The melody sounds familiar, like I might have[lr]::
66132::$$$message_0612_0014_0002$$$::heard it in school when I was a child.::

66145::$$$message_0612_0018_0000$$$::It's a nostalgic melody.[lr]::
66146::$$$message_0612_0018_0001$$$::The tune is simple and gentle, yet lonely.[lr]::
66147::$$$message_0612_0018_0002$$$::    I'm sure that Illya is happy.[lr]::
66148::$$$message_0612_0018_0003$$$::Otherwise, she wouldn't be singing on the way home.::
66149::$$$message_0612_0019_0000$$$::On the other hand, I can't help but think...[lr]::
66150::$$$message_0612_0019_0001$$$::Maybe Illya sings to herself a lot.[lr]::
66151::$$$message_0612_0019_0002$$$::With no one to talk to and no father waiting to greet her at home, perhaps this is the only way she can express herself when no one else is around.::

66168::$$$message_0612_0024_0000$$$::She innocently turns around.[lr]::
66169::$$$message_0612_0024_0001$$$::...She must be hiding how she really feels.::
66170::$$$message_0612_0025_0000$$$::Illya's shutting off her own feelings.[lr]::
66171::$$$message_0612_0025_0001$$$::Ever since Archer disappeared, she's become sullen at times.[lr]::
66172::$$$message_0612_0025_0002$$$::That's how we can have moments like this.[lr]::
66173::$$$message_0612_0025_0003$$$::Because if she doesn't hide how she really feels, then she can't smile.::

66175::$$$message_0612_0026_0001$$$::That goes for me, too.[lr]::

66177::$$$message_0612_0026_0003$$$::Turning away from what needs to be said.[lr]::
66178::$$$message_0612_0026_0004$$$::Illya let things be this way, so I joined in on the lie.::
66179::$$$message_0612_0027_0000$$$::"...Shirou?"[lr]::
66180::$$$message_0612_0027_0001$$$::...Illya must have given up.[lr]::
66181::$$$message_0612_0027_0002$$$::She stopped pursuing it, and decided to keep us company at our end.[lr]::
66182::$$$message_0612_0027_0003$$$::That's okay.[lr]::
66183::$$$message_0612_0027_0004$$$::If Illya's happy with our current relationship and willing to ignore it all, then it'll end without her losing anyone else.[lr]::

66193::$$$message_0612_0031_0000$$$::...She stops.[lr]::
66194::$$$message_0612_0031_0001$$$::With a flat voice, Illya asks,[lr]::
66195::$$$message_0612_0031_0002$$$::"Do you mean that as Kiritsugu's son?"[lr]::
66196::$$$message_0612_0031_0003$$$::She watches me quietly.::

66200::$$$message_0612_0032_0003$$$::I must carry on that responsibility as his son, even if we aren't related by blood.[lr]::
66201::$$$message_0612_0032_0004$$$::I have to settle things with this girl, not because Shirou Emiya wants it, but because Kiritsugu's son owes it to her.::
66202::$$$message_0612_0033_0000$$$::That's what Illya is asking me.[lr]::
66203::$$$message_0612_0033_0001$$$::Yeah, and my answer is, of course...::
66204::$$$message_0612_0034_0000$$$::"Yeah. I'm my father's son, and I like you. That's the only reason I want you to live with me."[lr]::
66205::$$$message_0612_0034_0001$$$::"...Are you serious? You think you can be his replacement?"[lr]::
66206::$$$message_0612_0034_0002$$$::"No. I can't be Kiritsugu, nor can I replace him. We're two different people. I can't give you back what he owes you."::
66207::$$$message_0612_0035_0000$$$::"But I love my old man. I want to finish what he couldn't.[lr]::

66210::$$$message_0612_0036_0001$$$::"Then I want to live with you, Illya.[lr]::
66211::$$$message_0612_0036_0002$$$::Is it wrong to try and take back the things you couldn't do until now? Is it wrong for us to live together, even if we're only starting now?"::
66212::$$$message_0612_0037_0000$$$::...She doesn't answer.[lr]::
66213::$$$message_0612_0037_0001$$$::Illya looks down for a while, and then slightly shakes her head.::
66214::$$$message_0612_0038_0000$$$::"It's impossible. I don't have long to live and neither do you. So we can't live together."[lr]::
66215::$$$message_0612_0038_0001$$$::She rejects me with a smile like a pretty flower.::

66218::$$$message_0612_0040_0001$$$::...Yes, if one of us makes a sacrifice, the other might be able to live a little longer. But I don't think we can both do that. If I live once this war is over, you won't be around anymore."::
66219::$$$message_0612_0041_0000$$$::"See? That's why it can't happen. Because there's no place for me in the Emiya house, if you aren't there too."::

66226::$$$message_0612_0044_0001$$$::I don't understand what she's saying.[lr]::
66227::$$$message_0612_0044_0002$$$::Not her declaration that one of us has to die, or how she can say it all with a smile.::
66228::$$$message_0612_0045_0000$$$::"...You're talking crazy. That won't happen.[lr]::
66229::$$$message_0612_0045_0001$$$::Zouken might come after you, but we'll defeat him first. That's why you're working together with Tohsaka, isn't it?"::
66230::$$$message_0612_0046_0000$$$::"...Yes. But that's also the problem.[lr]::

66238::$$$message_0612_0048_0001$$$::How does she know that Archer's magecraft is a manifestation of his mind's shape?::
66239::$$$message_0612_0049_0000$$$::"...That's why it won't work. The only way to make what Rin needs is for you to use Archer's arm. But I'm sure you know what that entails.[lr]::
66240::$$$message_0612_0049_0001$$$::...It'll take more than a fleeting fragment of his memories. You'll stop being Shirou once you use it."::
66241::$$$message_0612_0050_0000$$$::"Right now, you're a little confused because you keep thinking lots and lots of things about yourself, Sakura, and me.[lr]::
66242::$$$message_0612_0050_0001$$$::So, I'll forget that you asked me this.[lr]::
66243::$$$message_0612_0050_0002$$$::You know as well as I do that you can only choose to save one person, not everyone."::
