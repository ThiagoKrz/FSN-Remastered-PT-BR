70198::$$$message_0642_0000_0000$$$::It's 10:00 PM.[lr]::
70199::$$$message_0642_0000_0001$$$::Tohsaka said that she was going to prep until midnight, and then head to Ryudou Temple.::
70200::$$$message_0642_0001_0000$$$::"Now, I'm going to have you Project the Jeweled Sword. How are you feeling? Can you Project it while keeping Archer's arm under control?"[lr]::
70201::$$$message_0642_0001_0001$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
70202::$$$message_0642_0001_0002$$$::...Oh, right.[lr]::
70203::$$$message_0642_0001_0003$$$::Illya hasn't told Tohsaka that I took off the holy shroud.[lr]::
70204::$$$message_0642_0001_0004$$$::"Um... I think I'll manage."::
70205::$$$message_0642_0002_0000$$$::"Ooh, that's reassuring. The rest is up to you and Illya.[lr]::
70206::$$$message_0642_0002_0001$$$::I did my best to find you an Azoth Blade similar to the Jeweled Sword, and Illya will be supporting your Projection. If this goes well, we won't be able to replicate the original, but we should get something with about half of its power."[lr]::
70207::$$$message_0642_0002_0002$$$::Tohsaka hands me a dagger.::
70208::$$$message_0642_0003_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
70209::$$$message_0642_0003_0001$$$::This is a knife for use in rituals.[lr]::
70210::$$$message_0642_0003_0002$$$::It looks well-used. I wonder if Tohsaka favors it.[lr]::
70211::$$$message_0642_0003_0003$$$::But not just that[line2]even I can tell that it's charged with a massive amount of magical energy.::
70212::$$$message_0642_0004_0000$$$::...It might just be a small handful compared to the Shadow cloaking Sakura, but it's hundreds of times my own capacity.::
70213::$$$message_0642_0005_0000$$$::"...This thing is amazing. Were you hiding a secret weapon like this the whole time?"[lr]::
70214::$$$message_0642_0005_0001$$$::"Of course it's amazing. I transferred all the jewels I have left into it, so it has ten years' worth of my magical energy."::
70215::$$$message_0642_0006_0000$$$::Tohsaka pouts, like she can't bear to let it go.[lr]::
70216::$$$message_0642_0006_0001$$$::...Knowing Tohsaka's personality, she might be someone who's really strict with money.[lr]::
70217::$$$message_0642_0006_0002$$$::Setting that aside...::
70218::$$$message_0642_0007_0000$$$::"Huh. Are you sure, Tohsaka? That means you won't have any reserves left. I know you aren't in top condition, so can you still fight?"::
70219::$$$message_0642_0008_0000$$$::"I can still jump and run around, so I'll manage. I still haven't recovered enough power to use magecraft, though."[lr]::
70220::$$$message_0642_0008_0001$$$::"Wait... Then, you shouldn't[line2]"::
70221::$$$message_0642_0009_0000$$$::"Don't worry about me. It won't be a problem if you can pull this Projection off. That sword has extraordinary power. It even stopped the Moonfall."::
70222::$$$message_0642_0010_0000$$$::"???"[lr]::
70223::$$$message_0642_0010_0001$$$::I'm not sure what she's talking about, but Tohsaka seems confident.[lr]::
70224::$$$message_0642_0010_0002$$$::...I guess I don't need to worry, then.::
70225::$$$message_0642_0011_0000$$$::"Let's get started, Shirou. It'll take time to Project that sword, even for you. It'll be midnight if we don't start soon."::
70226::$$$message_0642_0012_0000$$$::"Yeah. Let's go back to my room, then. You need a quiet place for the best chance of success."[lr]::
70227::$$$message_0642_0012_0001$$$::Tohsaka beckons us to follow her to the living room.::
70228::$$$message_0642_0013_0000$$$::"Oh, hold on. I'll Project it in the shed.[lr]::
70229::$$$message_0642_0013_0001$$$::I want to be alone with Illya while I do the Projection, so go wait in your room, Tohsaka."[lr]::
70230::$$$message_0642_0013_0002$$$::"Why? If something goes wrong, shouldn't I be there to back you up?"::
70231::$$$message_0642_0014_0000$$$::"That won't be necessary. You'll actually just get in the way, Rin.[lr]::
70232::$$$message_0642_0014_0001$$$::Shirou's easily distracted, and the biggest distraction would be if you tripped in front of him."::
70233::$$$message_0642_0015_0000$$$::"...Mrgh. That's rude, Illya."[lr]::
70234::$$$message_0642_0015_0001$$$::Tohsaka groans grumpily.[lr]::
70235::$$$message_0642_0015_0002$$$::But she doesn't deny that she's the person most likely to make careless mistakes.::
70236::$$$message_0642_0016_0000$$$::"...All right. I'll wait outside the shed. That's fine, right?"[lr]::
70237::$$$message_0642_0016_0001$$$::"...I guess it has to be, if that's the most you can compromise."::
70238::$$$message_0642_0017_0000$$$::"Rin, if you want the replicate the Jeweled Sword, then don't come in until I tell you to. I'll call you if it seems like an accident's about to happen, but unless that happens, stay outside, no matter what."::
70239::$$$message_0642_0018_0000$$$::"Persistent, aren't you? I said I get it. I won't go in even if Shirou screams."[lr]::
70240::$$$message_0642_0018_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
70241::$$$message_0642_0018_0002$$$::The two of them casually bring up some very concerning examples.::
70242::$$$message_0642_0019_0000$$$::"Come on, Shirou."[lr]::
70243::$$$message_0642_0019_0001$$$::Illya enters the shed.[lr]::
70244::$$$message_0642_0019_0002$$$::I follow her, when something hits me.::
70245::$$$message_0642_0020_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, can I have this sword?"[lr]::
70246::$$$message_0642_0020_0001$$$::"Huh? I mean, you're about to use it for the Projection. The Azoth Blade will be gone once you make the Jeweled Sword."::
70247::$$$message_0642_0021_0000$$$::"Oh, right. The Jeweled Sword belongs to you, so can I have this instead?[lr]::
70248::$$$message_0642_0021_0001$$$::It might break if I fail, and I can't concentrate when I think of you getting mad at me for breaking something you own."::
70249::$$$message_0642_0022_0000$$$::"...Haah. Fine. If it makes you feel better, then you can keep the Azoth Blade."[lr]::
70250::$$$message_0642_0022_0001$$$::"Thanks. It'll pep me up."::
70251::$$$message_0642_0023_0000$$$::...I close the door.[lr]::
70252::$$$message_0642_0023_0001$$$::I can't let Tohsaka see what's next.[lr]::
70253::$$$message_0642_0023_0002$$$::She probably wouldn't stop me, but she would definitely feel responsible.[lr]::
70254::$$$message_0642_0023_0003$$$::The only way to alleviate that is to get her ex post facto approval with a "sorry, I actually used it," once the Holy Grail War is over.::
70255::$$$message_0642_0024_0000$$$::"...Ready, Shirou? I shouldn't need to explain the process to you, since you've released Archer's arm."[lr]::
70256::$$$message_0642_0024_0001$$$::I gulp and nod.[lr]::
70257::$$$message_0642_0024_0002$$$::Illya tells me to sit on the floor, and I follow her instructions.::
70258::$$$message_0642_0025_0000$$$::"But Illya, from what I've seen, Archer only Projects specific weapons. I don't have any information about the Jeweled Sword. Even if I have blueprints and a similar example, I can't replicate it."::
70259::$$$message_0642_0026_0000$$$::"I know. I'm going to have you search the records inside me. I haven't personally seen it, but there's a record of the Jeweled Sword inside my mind.[lr]::
70260::$$$message_0642_0026_0001$$$::We met the Tohsakas' grandmaster when we created the Greater grail.[lr]::
70261::$$$message_0642_0026_0002$$$::I'm sure she saw the Wizard Marshall's sword back then."::
70262::$$$message_0642_0027_0000$$$::"Wait, you mean..."[lr]::
70263::$$$message_0642_0027_0001$$$::"Just close your eyes. Stay still. I'm going to send your consciousness somewhere else. I did it before, remember? I'll send your sight inside me, where you can analyze the Jeweled Sword.[lr]::
70264::$$$message_0642_0027_0002$$$::...Once you're inside, I'll unbind your left arm. Your arm is going to invade you at the same time while you travel two hundred years into history. Keep a firm grip on yourself and try to finish the Projection as quickly as you can."::
70265::$$$message_0642_0028_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
70266::$$$message_0642_0028_0001$$$::Illya's voice is shaking.[lr]::
70267::$$$message_0642_0028_0002$$$::...I can feel her arms trembling as she hugs me from the front, too.::
70268::$$$message_0642_0029_0000$$$::"...I'll take you until we find the Jeweled Sword so you just need to still your breathing. Don't get distracted. Don't look at anything you don't have to. You just need to draw out the Zelretch."::
70269::$$$message_0642_0030_0000$$$::    Space shatters.[lr]::
70270::$$$message_0642_0030_0001$$$::Is it because all five of my senses plunge into Illya's internal records,[lr]::
70271::$$$message_0642_0030_0002$$$::or because she undid the binding on my left arm?::
70272::$$$message_0642_0031_0000$$$::There's no pain. My pain perception plunges into layers of spinning pain, but it's eroded by damage to my body which doesn't correspond to the pain.::
70273::$$$message_0642_0032_0000$$$::I don't know where I am.::
70274::$$$message_0642_0033_0000$$$::                                            I don't know who I am.::
70275::$$$message_0642_0034_0000$$$::                                                                     I don't know what this means.::
70276::$$$message_0642_0035_0000$$$::It's a giant circuit.[lr]::
70277::$$$message_0642_0035_0001$$$::Dozens of layers of crests adorn a stone mortar over fifty meters in radius.[lr]::
70278::$$$message_0642_0035_0002$$$::It's like I'm looking out across the landscape of Arizona through a huge telescope.::
70279::$$$message_0642_0036_0000$$$::The circuits stretch out in multiple layers.[lr]::
70280::$$$message_0642_0036_0001$$$::They circle around in geometric patterns.[lr]::
70281::$$$message_0642_0036_0002$$$::A pale girl stands in the middle of that beautiful spiderweb.::
70282::$$$message_0642_0037_0000$$$::Her name is Justeaze.[lr]::
70283::$$$message_0642_0037_0001$$$::Justeaze Lizrich von Einzbern.[lr]::
70284::$$$message_0642_0037_0002$$$::She is the mage who established the Holy Grail War on this land,[lr]::
70285::$$$message_0642_0037_0003$$$::the archmage revered as the Winter Saint, accompanied by Zouken Makiri and Nagato Tohsaka.::
70286::$$$message_0642_0038_0000$$$::The Greater Grail is active.[lr]::
70287::$$$message_0642_0038_0001$$$::Justeaze acts as the key, attempting to recreate an ancient Magic.[lr]::
70288::$$$message_0642_0038_0002$$$::Without her, the Holy Grail would only be a Holy Grail.[lr]::
70289::$$$message_0642_0038_0003$$$::Heaven's Feel requires her will.[lr]::
70290::$$$message_0642_0038_0004$$$::The old man is well aware that in Makiri's or Tohsaka's hands, it would be nothing but a wish-granter.::
70291::$$$message_0642_0039_0000$$$::    My field of vision shrinks.[lr]::
70292::$$$message_0642_0039_0001$$$::The world zooms in.[lr]::
70293::$$$message_0642_0039_0002$$$::I cut my consciousness off from the excess. Because I cut my mind, my body becomes half its size.::
70294::$$$message_0642_0040_0000$$$::From the lower perspective of my shrunken body, the world is far too big.[lr]::
70295::$$$message_0642_0040_0001$$$::Eventually, I won't be able to see anything.[lr]::
70296::$$$message_0642_0040_0002$$$::How the two hundred-year-old ritual was created doesn't matter to me.[lr]::
70297::$$$message_0642_0040_0003$$$::I'm only here to see one thing.[lr]::
70298::$$$message_0642_0040_0004$$$::I contract my awareness again, focusing on the sword an old man is holding as he watches over the Greater Grail and its affairs.::
70299::$$$message_0642_0041_0000$$$::...That's the original.[lr]::
70300::$$$message_0642_0041_0001$$$::A ritual dagger with a jewel for a blade.[lr]::
70301::$$$message_0642_0041_0002$$$::It glitters like a kaleidoscope, searing my brain and my eyeballs.::

70305::$$$message_0642_0043_0002$$$::All I can do is imitate the shape.[lr]::
70306::$$$message_0642_0043_0003$$$::I can only analyze its structure and Project it.::
70307::$$$message_0642_0044_0000$$$::What magical theories are woven into it?[lr]::
70308::$$$message_0642_0044_0001$$$::I use Archer's arm and mobilize the entirety of the Heroic Spirit Emiya's knowledge, but the old man's dagger is an unexplored law of the world.[lr]::
70309::$$$message_0642_0044_0002$$$::It is from an alien planet[line2]no, an alien solar system.[lr]::
70310::$$$message_0642_0044_0003$$$::The old man embodies common wisdom from the far future, which our young species has yet to reach...::

70357::$$$message_0642_0060_0002$$$::I realize what she's talking about, and look down at the hard sensation in my left hand.::

70359::$$$message_0642_0061_0001$$$::I...Projected it.[lr]::
70360::$$$message_0642_0061_0002$$$::I pulled it off, but it looks somewhat different than what I saw in the record.[lr]::
70361::$$$message_0642_0061_0003$$$::In fact, I can't feel a speck of magical energy from this sword.[lr]::
70362::$$$message_0642_0061_0004$$$::Tohsaka's Azoth Blade would have been dozens of times better than this. The blade doesn't even look capable of cutting anything.::

70365::$$$message_0642_0063_0000$$$::"It's good enough. Only the Schweinorg lineage can use that sword. It's a magical sword unlike any other.[lr]::
70366::$$$message_0642_0063_0001$$$::I guess you could call it fate. Sakura is blessed by the Third, while Rin's going to operate the Second at a young age.

70368::$$$message_0642_0064_0000$$$::"Huh. This dagger's that amazing, huh?"[lr]::
70369::$$$message_0642_0064_0001$$$::"Yeah. To be exact, it's the Multi-Dimensional Phenomenon: Jeweled Sword Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg.[lr]::
70370::$$$message_0642_0064_0002$$$::It was the favorite weapon of the Wizard Marshall, called the Jeweled Sword Zelretch. It's been passed down to the Tohsakas as an heirloom.::
70371::$$$message_0642_0065_0000$$$::"Still, the Tohsakas only inherited the blueprints, not the Jeweled Sword itself.[lr]::
70372::$$$message_0642_0065_0001$$$::And it's a homework assignment from a Magician that the Tohsaka mages still haven't managed to finish after generations."::
70373::$$$message_0642_0066_0000$$$::"Homework from a Magician... Wait, that grandmaster Tohsaka mentioned is a Magician!?"::
70374::$$$message_0642_0067_0000$$$::"Yeah. But Zelretch is an eccentric who interacts with the everyday world especially often for a Magician, so he has other disciples.[lr]::
70375::$$$message_0642_0067_0001$$$::I think Zelretch isn't in this world at the moment, but he might pop in for a visit once he hears that Rin managed to make the Jeweled Sword herself."::
70376::$$$message_0642_0068_0000$$$::"Hm? Huh?"[lr]::
70377::$$$message_0642_0068_0001$$$::Not in this world? Pop in for a visit? She makes him sound like some kind of wanderer who travels around for fun.::

70379::$$$message_0642_0069_0001$$$::...But...[lr]::
70380::$$$message_0642_0069_0002$$$::I got...careless.[lr]::
70381::$$$message_0642_0069_0003$$$::My vision gets hazy when I relax.[lr]::
70382::$$$message_0642_0069_0004$$$::I clench my right hand and let the pendant dig into my torn skin. It keeps me awake.::
70383::$$$message_0642_0070_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
70384::$$$message_0642_0070_0001$$$::I try to steady my breathing without letting Illya notice.[lr]::
70385::$$$message_0642_0070_0002$$$::My limbs... I can still feel my limbs.::
70386::$$$message_0642_0071_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
70387::$$$message_0642_0071_0001$$$::...Thank goodness.[lr]::
70388::$$$message_0642_0071_0002$$$::I was afraid I'd lose something after even one Projection, but I'm not missing any part of my body.[lr]::
70389::$$$message_0642_0071_0003$$$::My brain still works.[lr]::
70390::$$$message_0642_0071_0004$$$::The fact I still know who I am is the strongest evidence of that.[lr]::
70391::$$$message_0642_0071_0005$$$::I should be able to manage one more Projection.::
70392::$$$message_0642_0072_0000$$$::   Not that I should try.[lr]::
70393::$$$message_0642_0072_0001$$$::I'm going to save Sakura using a different way than Tohsaka.[lr]::
70394::$$$message_0642_0072_0002$$$::Now that I have Archer's arm, for the first time I can::
70395::$$$message_0642_0073_0000$$$::"[line5]like[line6]that. Basically, the Grandmaster's Magic[line6]the[line4]parallel worlds. So people gave him nicknames like[line3]or Jewel Grandpa, or Kaleidoscope, or[r]::

70401::$$$message_0642_0074_0002$$$::It's not that I can't hear her, but Tohsaka's saying words I don't understand.[lr]::
70402::$$$message_0642_0074_0003$$$::She's using strange words, and holding something scary in her left hand.::
70403::$$$message_0642_0075_0000$$$::...Tohsaka's holding a sword I've never seen.[lr]::
70404::$$$message_0642_0075_0001$$$::Never seen?[lr]::
70405::$$$message_0642_0075_0002$$$::That can't be right.[lr]::
70406::$$$message_0642_0075_0003$$$::I just Projected that (I think), and my left hand is empty, which means I must've given it to her.::

70408::$$$message_0642_0076_0001$$$::Are you sure[line2]the Projection[line5]?"[lr]::

70410::$$$message_0642_0077_0000$$$::I feel a terrible chill.[lr]::
70411::$$$message_0642_0077_0001$$$::My memory is going away.[lr]::
70412::$$$message_0642_0077_0002$$$::I can't remember.[lr]::
70413::$$$message_0642_0077_0003$$$::My understanding doesn't match the details.::

70415::$$$message_0642_0078_0001$$$::I clench my right hand, hard.[lr]::
70416::$$$message_0642_0078_0002$$$::Blood drips, but I finally manage to focus my eyes.::
70417::$$$message_0642_0079_0000$$$::"...Um, Tohsaka..."[lr]::
70418::$$$message_0642_0079_0001$$$::I stand up.[lr]::
70419::$$$message_0642_0079_0002$$$::My limbs feel light compared to my disconnected head.[lr]::
70420::$$$message_0642_0079_0003$$$::They're so light that I suspect my insides are empty.::
70421::$$$message_0642_0080_0000$$$::"Don't give me that. Illya and I are going to try something, so settle down and[line2]hey, what's happened to your hand!?"::
70422::$$$message_0642_0081_0000$$$::Tohsaka rushes over to me.[lr]::
70423::$$$message_0642_0081_0001$$$::She moves shockingly slowly.[lr]::
70424::$$$message_0642_0081_0002$$$::"Huh...? Why are you holding this?"[lr]::
70425::$$$message_0642_0081_0003$$$::I disconnect my mind and realize that she's holding my bloody right hand.::
70426::$$$message_0642_0082_0000$$$::Tohsaka looks astonished. She's looking at the pendant in my hand.[lr]::
70427::$$$message_0642_0082_0001$$$::I don't know why she's so surprised.[lr]::
70428::$$$message_0642_0082_0002$$$::I'm holding this...because...::
70429::$$$message_0642_0083_0000$$$::"Shirou. Why do you have this? And why are you gripping it so hard? Are you crazy?"[lr]::
70430::$$$message_0642_0083_0001$$$::"Why? It's just a lucky charm. This is, um..."::
70431::$$$message_0642_0084_0000$$$::I found it.[lr]::
70432::$$$message_0642_0084_0001$$$::Where?[lr]::
70433::$$$message_0642_0084_0002$$$::It's something so easy and hard to forget, but I can't recall it no matter how hard I try.[lr]::
70434::$$$message_0642_0084_0003$$$::Yet, someone who isn't me, my left arm, it knows it, better than I do.::
70435::$$$message_0642_0085_0000$$$::"It's...precious...to me. I need to...keep it close...until the very end..."::
70436::$$$message_0642_0086_0000$$$::Words that aren't mine spill from my lips.[lr]::
70437::$$$message_0642_0086_0001$$$::"...[lr]::
70438::$$$message_0642_0086_0002$$$::Shirou. I have that pendant, too."::
70439::$$$message_0642_0087_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
70440::$$$message_0642_0087_0001$$$::Tohsaka takes a pendant out of her pocket.[lr]::
70441::$$$message_0642_0087_0002$$$::It's exactly the same.[lr]::
70442::$$$message_0642_0087_0003$$$::To a jewel-user like Tohsaka, this is probably an everyday sight. But she's so pretty, I bet an accessory like this would really liven her up.::
70443::$$$message_0642_0088_0000$$$::"Huh. They're exactly alike."[lr]::
70444::$$$message_0642_0088_0001$$$::I nod.::
70445::$$$message_0642_0089_0000$$$::"No, they're not. Mine's empty, but yours still has a little left in it. It isn't enough to use for anything, but... It has meaning because it was used."[lr]::
70446::$$$message_0642_0089_0001$$$::"Hm?"::
70447::$$$message_0642_0090_0000$$$::"Keep it. It might come in handy."[lr]::
70448::$$$message_0642_0090_0001$$$::Tohsaka puts her pendant away, then takes Illya's hand and starts walking.::
70449::$$$message_0642_0091_0000$$$::"Hey, Tohsaka. Where are you going?"[lr]::
70450::$$$message_0642_0091_0001$$$::"I need to speak with Illya. I'll give you an hour to rest, so go stay in your room.[lr]::
70451::$$$message_0642_0091_0002$$$::Also, get some first aid on that right hand, or I'll get really mad."::
70452::$$$message_0642_0092_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
70453::$$$message_0642_0092_0001$$$::Her bad temper is very nearly murderous.[lr]::
70454::$$$message_0642_0092_0002$$$::She goes off with Illya, who also doesn't say a word.::
