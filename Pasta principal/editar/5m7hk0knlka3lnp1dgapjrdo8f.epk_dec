50236::$$$message_0434_0000_0000$$$::The lights go out.[lr]::
50237::$$$message_0434_0000_0001$$$::Right before midnight, I look up at the frozen moon as I get lost in my training.::
50238::$$$message_0434_0001_0000$$$::"[font italic=true]Trace, on (Resonance, start).[font italic=false]"[lr]::
50239::$$$message_0434_0001_0001$$$::I fill my spine with a new nerve.[lr]::
50240::$$$message_0434_0001_0002$$$::I make a Magic Circuit within my body, create magical energy like I'm breathing, and comprehend the structure of the bokutou in my hand.::
50241::$$$message_0434_0002_0000$$$::"...[font italic=true]Basic framework, analyzed[font italic=false]."[lr]::
50242::$$$message_0434_0002_0001$$$::I run magical energy through the sword and Strengthen it.[lr]::
50243::$$$message_0434_0002_0002$$$::I analyze the structure, alter it, and reinforce it.::
50244::$$$message_0434_0003_0000$$$::"...[font italic=true]Component materials, reinforced.[font italic=false]"[lr]::
50245::$$$message_0434_0003_0001$$$::The usual process is going too smoothly.[lr]::
50246::$$$message_0434_0003_0002$$$::...I don't know if it's because I became a Master, but Strengthening got a lot easier. I used to only have a success rate in the single digits. I'm also able to make a Magic Circuit in a flash.::
50247::$$$message_0434_0004_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
50248::$$$message_0434_0004_0001$$$::...No, it's not because I became a Master.[lr]::
50249::$$$message_0434_0004_0002$$$::I'm just copying.::
50250::$$$message_0434_0005_0000$$$::His swords.[lr]::
50251::$$$message_0434_0005_0001$$$::I'm just imitating the red knight that I saw at Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
50252::$$$message_0434_0005_0002$$$::Copying his twin swords, his sword technique, and now even his breathing.::
50253::$$$message_0434_0006_0000$$$::"...This is a fake. This isn't mine."[lr]::
50254::$$$message_0434_0006_0001$$$::I can't help but feel self-hatred.[lr]::
50255::$$$message_0434_0006_0002$$$::My skills improve just by copying him.[lr]::
50256::$$$message_0434_0006_0003$$$::Even though I know this isn't my power, I have to rely on it.::
50257::$$$message_0434_0007_0000$$$::It was because of his sword technique that I was able to fight those bone puppets at school,[lr]::
50258::$$$message_0434_0007_0001$$$::and it was because of the Projection of his twin swords that I was able to fend off Kuzuki's ferocious attacks.[lr]::
50259::$$$message_0434_0007_0002$$$::...Even now...[lr]::
50260::$$$message_0434_0007_0003$$$::I'm certain that I can reproduce those swords again if I repeat the process and put in everything I have.::
50261::$$$message_0434_0008_0000$$$::"...Like Strengthening but different. I just have to put in the start and the finish and separate it into exactly eight sections..."[lr]::
50262::$$$message_0434_0008_0001$$$::I have to swap out resonating with Projecting.[lr]::
50263::$$$message_0434_0008_0002$$$::...The words are still the same.[lr]::
50264::$$$message_0434_0008_0003$$$::There's no need to change the chant if what it does to me stays the same.[lr]::
50265::$$$message_0434_0008_0004$$$::First of all, I only know and can use one spell to restructure myself.::
50266::$$$message_0434_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50267::$$$message_0434_0009_0001$$$::I set down the sword that I finished Strengthening.[lr]::
50268::$$$message_0434_0009_0002$$$::...The left half of my body is still numb.[lr]::
50269::$$$message_0434_0009_0003$$$::I had hoped this would be okay after a day, but it doesn't look like I'm that lucky.[lr]::
50270::$$$message_0434_0009_0004$$$::If this is the trade-off for magecraft beyond my level, for imitating Archer's blades, I may just destroy myself if I use Projection one more time.::
50271::$$$message_0434_0010_0000$$$::"...Phew."[lr]::
50272::$$$message_0434_0010_0001$$$::I remove the nerve I gouged into my spine.[lr]::
50273::$$$message_0434_0010_0002$$$::My body is released from the toxin called the Magic Circuit, and tension escapes my body.[lr]::
50274::$$$message_0434_0010_0003$$$::Then...[lr]::
50275::$$$message_0434_0010_0004$$$::"Shirou? Are you not able to sleep?"[lr]::
50276::$$$message_0434_0010_0005$$$::Saber quietly comes inside.::
50277::$$$message_0434_0011_0000$$$::"No, I'm fine. This is my daily routine, so don't worry."[lr]::
50278::$$$message_0434_0011_0001$$$::I must be relieved to have finished today's daily routine.[lr]::
50279::$$$message_0434_0011_0002$$$::My voice that responds is surprisingly gentle.::
50280::$$$message_0434_0012_0000$$$::"It was lively today."[lr]::
50281::$$$message_0434_0012_0001$$$::"Yeah. Even though they're different, it was like having double Fuji-nee."[lr]::
50282::$$$message_0434_0012_0002$$$::I answer her smile with a smile.[lr]::
50283::$$$message_0434_0012_0003$$$::Saber actually seems to ruefully mutter something under her breath as she sits down next to me.::
50284::$$$message_0434_0013_0000$$$::"But you're training tonight as well? You do not seem to change your routine no matter what happens, Shirou."[lr]::
50285::$$$message_0434_0013_0001$$$::"Huh...? Yeah, my old man taught me to do it without a day of rest. Well, that's the only thing he taught me, though."::
50286::$$$message_0434_0014_0000$$$::"That is it...? Then he did not teach you any knowledge or how to live as a mage?"::
50287::$$$message_0434_0015_0000$$$::"No. First of all, he wasn't even like a mage himself.[lr]::
50288::$$$message_0434_0015_0001$$$::He was a pain in the ass, if I'm honest. He was often spacey and a klutz. He would say you need to enjoy life to its fullest and horse around a lot like a kid.[lr]::
50289::$$$message_0434_0015_0002$$$::You wouldn't be able to believe him if he said he was a mage."::
50290::$$$message_0434_0016_0000$$$::I can tell that I'm smiling as I talk about him.[lr]::
50291::$$$message_0434_0016_0001$$$::About the past.[lr]::
50292::$$$message_0434_0016_0002$$$::The five years from after the fire to his death.[lr]::
50293::$$$message_0434_0016_0003$$$::Thinking back now, that might've genuinely been the most fun time in my life.::
50294::$$$message_0434_0017_0000$$$::"I see. So you liked him for who he was."::
50295::$$$message_0434_0018_0000$$$::"...Yeah. Tohsaka might get mad if she heard this, but I admired him. Even though he was a free spirit and not like a mage at all, he was a Magician to me.[lr]::
50296::$$$message_0434_0018_0001$$$::And really, I had to look after him. He was way more immature than I was."::
50297::$$$message_0434_0019_0000$$$::"Yes, I know how you feel. I had a court magus of my own, but that clown was immature as well."[lr]::
50298::$$$message_0434_0019_0001$$$::"That clown...? I don't think I've ever heard you refer to someone so badly."::
50299::$$$message_0434_0020_0000$$$::"No, he is an exception. He was a horrible old man. I respected him and loved him, but at the same time, he was the source of every problem. It would have been a better age had he not been so impish."::
50300::$$$message_0434_0021_0000$$$::"...Wow. That's something else. He sounds like trouble, for sure."::
50301::$$$message_0434_0022_0000$$$::"He was. To make matters worse, he had many love affairs, or perhaps you could say he was too full of love. In the end, it backfired on him and caused him to be imprisoned. But knowing that dirty old man, I am sure he is still somewhere speaking on the topic."[lr]::
50302::$$$message_0434_0022_0001$$$::I can't tell if she's fed up or ready to laugh.[lr]::
50303::$$$message_0434_0022_0002$$$::Saber both openly speaks of her past and seems to swallow back on saying more.::
50304::$$$message_0434_0023_0000$$$::And after a brief silence.[lr]::
50305::$$$message_0434_0023_0001$$$::"Shirou. What's going on with the left half of your body?"[lr]::
50306::$$$message_0434_0023_0002$$$::With an earnest, concerned gaze, she pushes me about something I don't want her to know about.::
50307::$$$message_0434_0024_0000$$$::"...What? You knew, Saber?"[lr]::
50308::$$$message_0434_0024_0001$$$::"Anyone would notice after you broke so many plates.[lr]::
50309::$$$message_0434_0024_0002$$$::So, how is it? From what I can tell, it seems like it is only half of your body that has something wrong with it."::
50310::$$$message_0434_0025_0000$$$::"No, it's not like there's something wrong with it. It's just numb."[lr]::
50311::$$$message_0434_0025_0001$$$::I explain to her about how my body felt weird since this morning, how it doesn't affect my physical abilities at all, and how the cause must be the feedback from last night's Projection magecraft.::
50312::$$$message_0434_0026_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
50313::$$$message_0434_0026_0001$$$::Saber looks at me with uneasy eyes.[lr]::
50314::$$$message_0434_0026_0002$$$::When I try to smile back at her to tell her everything is fine...::
50315::$$$message_0434_0027_0000$$$::"...Most of your body is still numb, huh? Well, that's to be expected."[lr]::
50316::$$$message_0434_0027_0001$$$::The red knight appears, standing in the doorway.::
50317::$$$message_0434_0028_0000$$$::"Archer...!"[lr]::
50318::$$$message_0434_0028_0001$$$::Saber turns quickly, protectively placing herself between us.[lr]::
50319::$$$message_0434_0028_0002$$$::...To her, he is an enemy who attacked me.::
50320::$$$message_0434_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50321::$$$message_0434_0029_0001$$$::...And he is also an enemy to me.[lr]::
50322::$$$message_0434_0029_0002$$$::[font italic=true]"...Drown in your ideals."[font italic=false][r][wsay canskip=1]::
50323::$$$message_0434_0029_0003$$$::Those words that he said before he slashed me would not get out of my head...::
50324::$$$message_0434_0030_0000$$$::"What do you want, Archer? We should have a pact not to attack one another. Leave at this instant if you want to protect your Master's life."[lr]::
50325::$$$message_0434_0030_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50326::$$$message_0434_0030_0002$$$::Archer doesn't answer and steps in closer.::
50327::$$$message_0434_0031_0000$$$::"...Stop right there! If you come any closer, prepare yourself."[lr]::
50328::$$$message_0434_0031_0001$$$::Saber's hostility turns outright violent.::
50329::$$$message_0434_0032_0000$$$::"...No, hold on, Saber. He's not trying to fight.[lr]::
50330::$$$message_0434_0032_0001$$$::And we can't fight here."[lr]::
50331::$$$message_0434_0032_0002$$$::"...That is true, but Shirou..."::
50332::$$$message_0434_0033_0000$$$::"It's fine. What do you want, Archer?[lr]::
50333::$$$message_0434_0033_0001$$$::You didn't come here just to say hello, right?"[lr]::
50334::$$$message_0434_0033_0002$$$::I move Saber aside and confront Archer.::
50335::$$$message_0434_0034_0000$$$::...Ugh.[lr]::
50336::$$$message_0434_0034_0001$$$::I still don't like this guy.[lr]::
50337::$$$message_0434_0034_0002$$$::Our perspectives are different, but there's also no doubt that I just can't instinctively stand him. A chill runs up my spine the moment I see his face.[lr]::
50338::$$$message_0434_0034_0003$$$::It just seems like we're born to hate each other or to always be enemies.::
50339::$$$message_0434_0035_0000$$$::"Hey. If you don't have any business, get out."[lr]::
50340::$$$message_0434_0035_0001$$$::"...Heh. I heard from Rin that you used Projection, but it really is true, huh? Half of your body is numb and your movements are seven centimeters off from your center, right?"::
50341::$$$message_0434_0036_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50342::$$$message_0434_0036_0001$$$::I clamp down on a gasp.[lr]::
50343::$$$message_0434_0036_0002$$$::Archer's observation is so accurate that it's scary.::
50344::$$$message_0434_0037_0000$$$::"Let me see your body. I may be able to help."[lr]::
50345::$$$message_0434_0037_0001$$$::Archer reaches out.::
50346::$$$message_0434_0038_0000$$$::"Nnn...!"[lr]::
50347::$$$message_0434_0038_0001$$$::"No, stop, Saber... I just have to show you my body, right?"[lr]::
50348::$$$message_0434_0038_0002$$$::I take my shirt off and show Archer my back.::
50349::$$$message_0434_0039_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50350::$$$message_0434_0039_0001$$$::Archer silently places his hand on my back.[lr]::
50351::$$$message_0434_0039_0002$$$::"Hrrk..."[lr]::
50352::$$$message_0434_0039_0003$$$::A slight pain.[lr]::
50353::$$$message_0434_0039_0004$$$::The left half of my body which was numb to any sensation[line2]or pain[line2]feels hot, as if I got stabbed by a needle.::
50354::$$$message_0434_0040_0000$$$::"...You're in luck. I thought it was necrosis, but you only opened up what was closed. This should heal within a few days."[lr]::
50355::$$$message_0434_0040_0001$$$::"...I opened up what was closed?"::
50356::$$$message_0434_0041_0000$$$::"Yes. You seem to be misunderstanding, but Magic Circuits are not something you make each time, but something you reveal. Once you make it, it is only something that you bring to the surface.[lr]::
50357::$$$message_0434_0041_0001$$$::...Since you don't know what you're doing, the circuit that is supposed to be used has been neglected and is dormant.[lr]::
50358::$$$message_0434_0041_0002$$$::It must be a blind spot that neither your mentor nor Rin could think of. A proper mage would never imagine a heretic whose nerves themselves become the circuit."::
50359::$$$message_0434_0042_0000$$$::"Your numbness is temporary. It is the result of running full magical energy through a circuit that was there but never used, so it is only 'surprised' right now.[lr]::
50360::$$$message_0434_0042_0001$$$::However, a wind has gone through a section that was neglected after all. The nerves will eventually recall its normal function, and the dormant circuit is now activated."::
50361::$$$message_0434_0043_0000$$$::"Hrrk..."[lr]::
50362::$$$message_0434_0043_0001$$$::The needle stabs my back again.[lr]::
50363::$$$message_0434_0043_0002$$$::I hear a definite thumping from the half of my body that was numb all day.::
50364::$$$message_0434_0044_0000$$$::"...That should do. You should be a better mage by the time your body can move. At any rate, you got too greedy trying to make my swords for the first time."[lr]::
50365::$$$message_0434_0044_0001$$$::Archer lets go.::
50366::$$$message_0434_0045_0000$$$::"...Then, there is nothing abnormal with Shirou's body?"[lr]::
50367::$$$message_0434_0045_0001$$$::"It was abnormal until now... No, it is normal for humans to keep such abnormalities dormant. In that regard, Shirou Emiya was already abnormal, but... Oh, well.[lr]::
50368::$$$message_0434_0045_0002$$$:: Anyhow, don't even think about using any magecraft tomorrow. If your nerves that are still healing burn out, it won't just be numb."::
50369::$$$message_0434_0046_0000$$$::"You seem to be knowledgeable, Archer."[lr]::
50370::$$$message_0434_0046_0001$$$::"I had a similar experience. I also had one of my arms taken away when I did it for the first time. That is what it means to learn new magecraft."::
50371::$$$message_0434_0047_0000$$$::He turns and tries to leave.[lr]::
50372::$$$message_0434_0047_0001$$$::"Hold on."[lr]::
50373::$$$message_0434_0047_0002$$$::I stop him.[lr]::
50374::$$$message_0434_0047_0003$$$::I want to know his true intention of helping me now, after trying to kill me before.::
50375::$$$message_0434_0048_0000$$$::"What? Are you going to ask Saber to continue that fight from before?"[lr]::
50376::$$$message_0434_0048_0001$$$::"I wouldn't do such a thing. I just want to ask you the meaning of what you said before."::
50377::$$$message_0434_0049_0000$$$::   Drown in your ideals.[lr]::
50378::$$$message_0434_0049_0001$$$::The meaning of that.[lr]::
50379::$$$message_0434_0049_0002$$$::The uneasiness that settled in the back of my mind won't go away unless I hear it from his mouth.::
50380::$$$message_0434_0050_0000$$$::"It is just as it sounds. There is nothing to add."[lr]::
50381::$$$message_0434_0050_0001$$$::There is no hesitation in his declaration.[lr]::
50382::$$$message_0434_0050_0002$$$::Archer seriously replies, without an ounce of hesitation.[lr]::
50383::$$$message_0434_0050_0003$$$::"Ugh...!"[lr]::
50384::$$$message_0434_0050_0004$$$::That...[lr]::
50385::$$$message_0434_0050_0005$$$::...Pisses me off so much that my vision goes white.::
50386::$$$message_0434_0051_0000$$$::"Then what about you, Archer...!?[lr]::
50387::$$$message_0434_0051_0001$$$::You say not to hold onto any ideals, but what are you fighting for?[lr]::
50388::$$$message_0434_0051_0002$$$::Every Servant has their own objective, right? Then, what's the reason you fight? If you don't have any ideals, what do you fight for?"::
50389::$$$message_0434_0052_0000$$$::"...It is nothing worth mentioning. The reason I fight is simply for myself.[lr]::
50390::$$$message_0434_0052_0001$$$::Pointless ways of the world, righteousness, ideals...[lr]::
50391::$$$message_0434_0052_0002$$$::Those uncertain reasons are fake. I hold my sword simply to fulfill my own desires. There is no other reason."::
50392::$$$message_0434_0053_0000$$$::"For... For yourself only, you said?"[lr]::
50393::$$$message_0434_0053_0001$$$::"Yes. If you desire the ideal of 'not hurting anyone,' then so be it. If you want to save others so much, then go ahead.[lr]::
50394::$$$message_0434_0053_0002$$$::However... Only if that is truly your own desire."::
50395::$$$message_0434_0054_0000$$$::"...Wha[line2]"[lr]::
50396::$$$message_0434_0054_0001$$$::My mind freezes.[lr]::
50397::$$$message_0434_0054_0002$$$::[font italic=true]What did he... just... say?[font italic=false]::
50398::$$$message_0434_0055_0000$$$::"If you are fighting out of your own will, the resulting crimes and punishments are all yours. Bearing that burden is within your ideal.[lr]::
50399::$$$message_0434_0055_0001$$$::But if that is a borrowed will, the ideal that you preach is only a fantasy."::
50400::$$$message_0434_0056_0000$$$::                                         In other words, it is a fake.::
50401::$$$message_0434_0057_0000$$$::"You need a reason to fight. But it cannot be an ideal. If you are to fight for an ideal, then you can only save ideals.[lr]::
50402::$$$message_0434_0057_0001$$$::There is no way to save people."::
50403::$$$message_0434_0058_0000$$$::I can't talk.[lr]::
50404::$$$message_0434_0058_0001$$$::I can't think of any rebuttal.[lr]::
50405::$$$message_0434_0058_0002$$$::Archer's words pierce through my chest like an arrow.[lr]::
50406::$$$message_0434_0058_0003$$$::Not just for me, but that applies to Saber who is beside me as well.::
