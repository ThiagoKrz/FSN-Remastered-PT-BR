43308::$$$message_0384_0000_0000$$$::"Guh..."[lr]::
43309::$$$message_0384_0000_0001$$$::...My wound hurts.[lr]::
43310::$$$message_0384_0000_0002$$$::The sweat that formed on my forehead drips down into my eyes, and my vision becomes cloudy.::
43311::$$$message_0384_0001_0000$$$::"Haah... Guh."[lr]::
43312::$$$message_0384_0001_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Even just walking hurts my wound too?[font italic=false][lr]::
43313::$$$message_0384_0001_0002$$$::My shoulder hurts every time I take a step, and my strides are getting shorter before I realize it.::
43314::$$$message_0384_0002_0000$$$::"...Emiya?"[lr]::
43315::$$$message_0384_0002_0001$$$::She looks back at me, as I am falling behind.[lr]::
43316::$$$message_0384_0002_0002$$$::...Then...[lr]::
43317::$$$message_0384_0002_0003$$$::Tohsaka suddenly looks at me with a straight face.::
43318::$$$message_0384_0003_0000$$$::"Let's rest a bit. It should be hard for you to even walk, Shirou."[lr]::
43319::$$$message_0384_0003_0001$$$::"Huh...? No, I'm fine. I can bear this much. But more importantly, we should get home as soon as we can."::
43320::$$$message_0384_0004_0000$$$::Either my place or her place.[lr]::
43321::$$$message_0384_0004_0001$$$::It doesn't matter which one, but for now, I should get Tohsaka back to her home ground as soon as possible.::
43322::$$$message_0384_0005_0000$$$::"Don't worry about my wound. It's not like it has poison in it."[lr]::
43323::$$$message_0384_0005_0001$$$::I ignore Tohsaka's stare and start walking.[lr]::
43324::$$$message_0384_0005_0002$$$::"Ungh..."[lr]::
43325::$$$message_0384_0005_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...Ugh.[font italic=false] How pitiful. My knee's about to snap just as I say that.::
43326::$$$message_0384_0006_0000$$$::"See! Ugh, you push yourself too much. It's suicidal to fight Kuzuki with that wound of yours. Take a rest. They won't come after us."::
43327::$$$message_0384_0007_0000$$$::"...I'd think so. But, we should get back as fast as we can. It's not that painful."[lr]::
43328::$$$message_0384_0007_0001$$$::"Hey now...! Don't say that it's not painful when you're bleeding that much! I don't know why you want to go home so much, but you should rest first!"::
43329::$$$message_0384_0008_0000$$$::She yells at me.[lr]::
43330::$$$message_0384_0008_0001$$$::...Yeah, she's not quite back to her normal self yet.[lr]::
43331::$$$message_0384_0008_0002$$$::She's lacking her usual calmness.[lr]::
43332::$$$message_0384_0008_0003$$$::She's an emotional person to start with, so I'm sure her anger will be unstoppable if her brakes give way.::
43333::$$$message_0384_0009_0000$$$::"Are you listening!? You're not Kirei, so it's a nuisance to have you leaving a trail of blood![lr]::
43334::$$$message_0384_0009_0001$$$::First of all, how did it even end up like this!? I did tell you to go to the church, but couldn't you tell that it was dangerous right away!?"::
43335::$$$message_0384_0010_0000$$$::"...Hey, don't make fun of me. I could understand that at least. I could tell that it was a helpless situation since I first saw the church."::
43336::$$$message_0384_0011_0000$$$::"Ugh! Then go home right away, idiot! Not only that, you burst in with that unhealed wound of yours, and on top of that, Projection!? Of course your wound would get worse! And you're saying it's not painful? Ugh, what's wrong with you!? Why do you push yourself that much...!!!???"::
43337::$$$message_0384_0012_0000$$$::Tohsaka goes off intensely.[lr]::
43338::$$$message_0384_0012_0001$$$::...No, but...[lr]::
43339::$$$message_0384_0012_0002$$$::It really isn't that painful; besides...::
43340::$$$message_0384_0013_0000$$$::"...It's more painful for you, right?"[lr]::
43341::$$$message_0384_0013_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
43342::$$$message_0384_0013_0002$$$::"So let's go home. You can complain once we get home."::
43343::$$$message_0384_0014_0000$$$::...Yeah, that's why I wanted to get home as soon as possible.[lr]::
43344::$$$message_0384_0014_0001$$$::There's no need to act that strong.[lr]::
43345::$$$message_0384_0014_0002$$$::Tohsaka can complain without constraint once she's back in her room at home.::
43346::$$$message_0384_0015_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
43347::$$$message_0384_0015_0001$$$::"Ungh!"[lr]::
43348::$$$message_0384_0015_0002$$$::She wipes her face as if she messed up and turns away.::
43349::$$$message_0384_0016_0000$$$::"Ah... Huh... Um."[lr]::
43350::$$$message_0384_0016_0001$$$::I-I can't think of what to say.[lr]::
43351::$$$message_0384_0016_0002$$$::That was...::
43352::$$$message_0384_0017_0000$$$::"...I can't believe it. A guy... made me cry."[lr]::
43353::$$$message_0384_0017_0001$$$::She murmurs while looking down.[lr]::
43354::$$$message_0384_0017_0002$$$::    Then...::
43355::$$$message_0384_0018_0000$$$::"Guh...! T-Tohsaka, your hand...! You're holding my hand...!"[lr]::
43356::$$$message_0384_0018_0001$$$::"...Shut up. Take responsibility, idiot."[lr]::
43357::$$$message_0384_0018_0002$$$::"Huh... Hey, m-my wound hurts...! Don't pull on my [font italic=true]left[font italic=false] hand...!"::
43358::$$$message_0384_0019_0000$$$::This place was a foreigners' cemetery from sometime ago.[lr]::
43359::$$$message_0384_0019_0001$$$::Once Tohsaka walks down to the grassy area, she finally lets go of my hand.::
43360::$$$message_0384_0020_0000$$$::"...Hey, Tohsaka.[lr]::
43361::$$$message_0384_0020_0001$$$::Now's not the time to be taking a detour[line2]"[lr]::
43362::$$$message_0384_0020_0002$$$::"Sit down. Just sit."[lr]::
43363::$$$message_0384_0020_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
43364::$$$message_0384_0020_0004$$$::Her intensity doesn't let me object, so I sit down for now.::
43365::$$$message_0384_0021_0000$$$::"Turn your back to me, and don't turn around no matter what. I'm gonna get pissed off if you look at my face."[lr]::
43366::$$$message_0384_0021_0001$$$::I hear a sound behind me.::
43367::$$$message_0384_0022_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
43368::$$$message_0384_0022_0001$$$::We sit down back to back on the grass.[lr]::
43369::$$$message_0384_0022_0002$$$::...I can't grasp what meaning there is to this.[lr]::
43370::$$$message_0384_0022_0003$$$::Tohsaka is silent now, and she told me not to turn around.[lr]::
43371::$$$message_0384_0022_0004$$$::There's nothing to do, so I look up at the night sky for now.::
43372::$$$message_0384_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43373::$$$message_0384_0023_0001$$$::I gasp at how vast it is.[lr]::
43374::$$$message_0384_0023_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Is it because we were underground for a long time, or is it just because the starry sky is clear tonight?[font italic=false][lr]::
43375::$$$message_0384_0023_0003$$$::Either way, the winter night sky is so beautiful that it makes me forget my pain.[lr]::
43376::$$$message_0384_0023_0004$$$::I don't mind Tohsaka's body heat that I feel through my back either.[lr]::
43377::$$$message_0384_0023_0005$$$::I gaze blankly at the dark sky, forgetting everything for now.::
43378::$$$message_0384_0024_0000$$$::   [font italic=true]How long have we been sitting like this?[font italic=false][lr]::
43379::$$$message_0384_0024_0001$$$::The person next to me talks to me in a calm voice.::
43380::$$$message_0384_0025_0000$$$::"...I'm just talking to myself."[lr]::
43381::$$$message_0384_0025_0001$$$::...I see. I can't reply if she's just talking to herself. I'll keep watching the stars in silence.::
43382::$$$message_0384_0026_0000$$$::"I might've made a bit of a mistake.[lr]::
43383::$$$message_0384_0026_0001$$$:: I should've done what Archer said and defeated Caster in the beginning without caring how I did it. [lr]::
43384::$$$message_0384_0026_0002$$$::I was trying to find an opening since I was worried about making small sacrifices, but in the end, I might be sacrificing the whole town the way things are now, right?"::
43385::$$$message_0384_0027_0000$$$::She keeps talking.[lr]::
43386::$$$message_0384_0027_0001$$$::This must be her whining.[lr]::
43387::$$$message_0384_0027_0002$$$::She's not confessing because of what I said earlier.[lr]::
43388::$$$message_0384_0027_0003$$$::In short, Tohsaka didn't want to reflect on her actions by herself, but wanted someone else to do it.::
43389::$$$message_0384_0028_0000$$$::"...I don't mean to complain. I always screw up when it counts most. I can handle the second or third most important thing with ease, but I have problems with the most important thing."::
43390::$$$message_0384_0029_0000$$$::The winter sky is clear.[lr]::
43391::$$$message_0384_0029_0001$$$::But, on the other hand, the temperature is freezing cold.[lr]::
43392::$$$message_0384_0029_0002$$$::[font italic=true]I don't care about myself, but isn't Tohsaka cold without a jacket?[font italic=false][lr]::
43393::$$$message_0384_0029_0003$$$::...I'm a little worried about that.::
43394::$$$message_0384_0030_0000$$$::"It's not only Archer's responsibility that he went over to that side either. In the end, I'm the one who let Caster be.[lr]::
43395::$$$message_0384_0030_0001$$$::But, yeah... Man, I said that earlier, but I got cornered all of a sudden."::
43396::$$$message_0384_0031_0000$$$::She sighs deeply.[lr]::
43397::$$$message_0384_0031_0001$$$::I can't see it, but her breath must be white.::
43398::$$$message_0384_0032_0000$$$::"...Hey. I think you're supposed to ask why here."[lr]::
43399::$$$message_0384_0032_0001$$$::"Oh. So what were you cornered by, Tohsaka?"::
43400::$$$message_0384_0033_0000$$$::"Yeah, I'm saying I don't want to regret anything.[lr]::
43401::$$$message_0384_0033_0001$$$::He said I'm not the type to regret my actions, but it seems like it's a crucial moment right now. Since you said such a thing, I feel depressed that I made a mistake even more."::
43402::$$$message_0384_0034_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43403::$$$message_0384_0034_0001$$$::...I see.[lr]::
43404::$$$message_0384_0034_0002$$$::I don't really get what she's talking about, but what Archer said is correct.[lr]::
43405::$$$message_0384_0034_0003$$$::Tohsaka is not the type to regret anything.::
43406::$$$message_0384_0035_0000$$$::"That's only now. It's irritating, but I agree with Archer's opinion. There's nothing for you to regret."[lr]::
43407::$$$message_0384_0035_0001$$$::"Why? Caster is doing what she wants, and even Archer became fed up with me. This is because I didn't go about this the right way, right?"::
43408::$$$message_0384_0036_0000$$$::"You weren't wrong, just unsuccessful. As long as you're not in the wrong, it's OK to be proud, even if things don't go your way."::
43409::$$$message_0384_0037_0000$$$::   In the process...[lr]::
43410::$$$message_0384_0037_0001$$$::If you walk down the path that you believe is right, you cannot be wrong.[lr]::
43411::$$$message_0384_0037_0002$$$::...Most people would realize that the path they chose itself was wrong, but she's different.[lr]::
43412::$$$message_0384_0037_0003$$$::Any path that she chooses should be something she is proud of.::
43413::$$$message_0384_0038_0000$$$::"...Yeah. To be honest, you've always shined.[lr]::
43414::$$$message_0384_0038_0001$$$::...I won't regret anything either. I believe what I've been doing is correct. But, it's full of patches."::
43415::$$$message_0384_0038_0002$$$::   I won't regret anything.[lr]::
43416::$$$message_0384_0038_0003$$$::I want to make the tragedies that happened into meaningful things by believing that the path I took is correct.::
43417::$$$message_0384_0038_0004$$$::"But you're different, right?[lr]::
43418::$$$message_0384_0038_0005$$$::Whenever you regret something, I bet you're the type to deliver twice as much payback. I conceal my regrets with patches, but you go and destroy yours to pieces with a straight face.[lr]::
43419::$$$message_0384_0038_0006$$$::You come out on top. I bet you only get depressed once in a while, but what comes after is scary in your case. I think you would make whoever made you depressed several times more depressed."::
43420::$$$message_0384_0038_0007$$$::"...Oof. What is that, are you trying to finish me off?"[lr]::
43421::$$$message_0384_0038_0008$$$::"Yeah. I figured I'd say it while you're down.[lr]::
43422::$$$message_0384_0038_0009$$$::But well, isn't it true? You don't intend to give up now, right?"::
43423::$$$message_0384_0039_0000$$$::I also say as if I'm talking to myself, while looking up at the sky.[lr]::
43424::$$$message_0384_0039_0001$$$::Tohsaka doesn't answer.[lr]::
43425::$$$message_0384_0039_0002$$$::But, somehow...[lr]::
43426::$$$message_0384_0039_0003$$$::I feel like she smiled, as though she pulled herself together.::
43427::$$$message_0384_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43428::$$$message_0384_0040_0001$$$::And silence follows.[lr]::
43429::$$$message_0384_0040_0002$$$::Tohsaka must've said everything she wanted to say, as she goes silent again.::
43430::$$$message_0384_0041_0000$$$::I aimlessly look up at the night sky.[lr]::
43431::$$$message_0384_0041_0001$$$::...We should be going home, but neither of us can stand up, so we just keep our backs together.::
43432::$$$message_0384_0042_0000$$$::"...Oh yeah. Why did you come help me, Shirou?"[lr]::
43433::$$$message_0384_0042_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
43434::$$$message_0384_0042_0002$$$::I can't explain.[lr]::
43435::$$$message_0384_0042_0003$$$::There are many reasons.[lr]::
43436::$$$message_0384_0042_0004$$$::I feel like it's silly to explain each one.[lr]::
43437::$$$message_0384_0042_0005$$$::That's how I feel, so I decide to tell her what I need to tell her most.::
43438::$$$message_0384_0043_0000$$$::"This pendant is familiar to you, right?"[lr]::
43439::$$$message_0384_0043_0001$$$::I show her the pendant.::
43440::$$$message_0384_0044_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43441::$$$message_0384_0044_0001$$$::...That's what I thought. I bet she tried to hide it, but she made a mistake again.::
43442::$$$message_0384_0045_0000$$$::"Hey... Why do you have that?"[lr]::
43443::$$$message_0384_0045_0001$$$::"I found it in your room. Oh... You might be surprised when you get home, sorry. I knocked down your dressing table."[lr]::
43444::$$$message_0384_0045_0002$$$::I return the pendant to Tohsaka from behind her.::
43445::$$$message_0384_0046_0000$$$::"...Hm. So, what about it?"[lr]::
43446::$$$message_0384_0046_0001$$$::"Well, I have the same pendant at home.[lr]::
43447::$$$message_0384_0046_0002$$$::I picked it up when I almost got killed by Lancer at school."::
43448::$$$message_0384_0047_0000$$$::I innocuously hint about that night.[lr]::
43449::$$$message_0384_0047_0001$$$::Then...[lr]::
43450::$$$message_0384_0047_0002$$$::"...You have the same thing...?"[lr]::
43451::$$$message_0384_0047_0003$$$::Tohsaka gasps, as if she saw something she shouldn't have seen.::
43452::$$$message_0384_0048_0000$$$::"Huh? Did I say something strange?"[lr]::
43453::$$$message_0384_0048_0001$$$::"Oh... No, not really...More importantly, why would that be the reason you helped me? Who cares about that pendant?"::
43454::$$$message_0384_0049_0000$$$::"You're right... Yeah, that was just an afterthought.[lr]::
43455::$$$message_0384_0049_0001$$$::To confess, I've admired Rin Tohsaka for a long time.[lr]::
43456::$$$message_0384_0049_0002$$$::And this is a problem, but I got to like you even more after talking to you. So I didn't want you to die, and I just jumped down without thinking before I realized it."::
43457::$$$message_0384_0050_0000$$$::"Hnng... H-Hey you, don't say it so directly! Y-You'll give me the wrong idea if you talk without thinking!"::
43458::$$$message_0384_0051_0000$$$::"Mrgh. Why would I? I really like you."[lr]::
43459::$$$message_0384_0051_0001$$$::I become obstinate and immediately reply.[lr]::
43460::$$$message_0384_0051_0002$$$::It's not a lie, so there's no misunderstanding to be had.::
43461::$$$message_0384_0052_0000$$$::"I-Idiot...! That's why you jumped in suicidally, you big idiot!"::
43462::$$$message_0384_0053_0000$$$::Tohsaka repeatedly calls me an idiot.[lr]::
43463::$$$message_0384_0053_0001$$$::She's criticizing me mercilessly, but it doesn't make me feel bad at all.[lr]::
43464::$$$message_0384_0053_0002$$$::The night sky is beautiful, and I feel calm.[lr]::
43465::$$$message_0384_0053_0003$$$::Most of all, I'm really happy that Tohsaka is back to her usual self.::
43466::$$$message_0384_0054_0000$$$::"All right. Let's go home like you said."::
43467::$$$message_0384_0055_0000$$$::"Here, give me your hand. It should be hard to even stand with that wound of yours."[lr]::
43468::$$$message_0384_0055_0001$$$::I grab her hand with my right hand.[lr]::
43469::$$$message_0384_0055_0002$$$::Tohsaka lets out an energetic sound and pulls me up.::
43470::$$$message_0384_0056_0000$$$::"So we don't owe each other anything anymore now. Let's not count today's incident."::
43471::$$$message_0384_0057_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
43472::$$$message_0384_0057_0001$$$::Yeah, that helps.[lr]::
43473::$$$message_0384_0057_0002$$$::I don't know what that pendant meant to Tohsaka.[lr]::
43474::$$$message_0384_0057_0003$$$::I bet I would feel more indebted to Tohsaka if I found out.[lr]::
43475::$$$message_0384_0057_0004$$$::Tohsaka didn't want that and said the incidents offset each other.[lr]::
43476::$$$message_0384_0057_0005$$$::That's why Tohsaka shouldn't feel indebted about being helped earlier either.::
43477::$$$message_0384_0058_0000$$$::And we leave the foreigners' cemetery.[lr]::
43478::$$$message_0384_0058_0001$$$::On the way back, quietly...[lr]::
43479::$$$message_0384_0058_0002$$$::"...Thanks for saving me, Shirou. Um, it really did help me out."[lr]::
43480::$$$message_0384_0058_0003$$$::Tohsaka adds with embarrassment.::
