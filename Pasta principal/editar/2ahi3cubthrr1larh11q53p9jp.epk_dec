73383::$$$message_0673_0000_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
73384::$$$message_0673_0000_0001$$$::When I get back to the house, the first thing I feel is a terrible chill.[lr]::
73385::$$$message_0673_0000_0002$$$::Nothing seems particularly out of place, nor do I sense any danger.[lr]::
73386::$$$message_0673_0000_0003$$$::I just have a vaguely cold sense of foreboding.::
73387::$$$message_0673_0001_0000$$$::The living room is empty.[lr]::
73388::$$$message_0673_0001_0001$$$::Illya is sleeping in the tatami room.[lr]::
73389::$$$message_0673_0001_0002$$$::Tohsaka's getting ready for the Projection in her guestroom.[lr]::
73390::$$$message_0673_0001_0003$$$::As for Sakura...::
73391::$$$message_0673_0002_0000$$$::"Sakura, I'm coming in."[lr]::
73392::$$$message_0673_0002_0001$$$::I announce myself and reach for the doorknob.[lr]::
73393::$$$message_0673_0002_0002$$$::   The chill runs down my back again.[lr]::
73394::$$$message_0673_0002_0003$$$::Something feels wrong, something missing, but I shake off the hunch and open the door.::
73395::$$$message_0673_0003_0000$$$::"Sakura[line2]"[lr]::
73396::$$$message_0673_0003_0001$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
73397::$$$message_0673_0003_0002$$$::I catch sight of Rider for an instant, before she vanishes like a ghost.[lr]::
73398::$$$message_0673_0003_0003$$$::Behind her...[lr]::
73399::$$$message_0673_0003_0004$$$::The bed that Sakura is supposed to be sleeping in is unoccupied.::
73400::$$$message_0673_0004_0000$$$::"Ngh."[lr]::
73401::$$$message_0673_0004_0001$$$::The lights turn on.[lr]::
73402::$$$message_0673_0004_0002$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
73403::$$$message_0673_0004_0003$$$::I blink at the sudden illumination.[lr]::
73404::$$$message_0673_0004_0004$$$::"Welcome back. I won't ask where you've been, but you sure took a while."::
73405::$$$message_0673_0005_0000$$$::"Tohsaka...? What's going on..."[lr]::
73406::$$$message_0673_0005_0001$$$::"I'm sure you can tell. Sakura left the house on her own, and I've been stuck here in a staring match with Rider.[lr]::
73407::$$$message_0673_0005_0002$$$::...She probably got told not to lay a hand on you. The second you came in, she went into spirit form and ran outside."::
73408::$$$message_0673_0006_0000$$$::"What..."[lr]::
73409::$$$message_0673_0006_0001$$$::Tohsaka's voice is calm.[lr]::
73410::$$$message_0673_0006_0002$$$::...No, it isn't.[lr]::
73411::$$$message_0673_0006_0003$$$::This isn't the voice of someone composed.[lr]::
73412::$$$message_0673_0006_0004$$$::Her cold, flat tone sounds like she's given up.::
73413::$$$message_0673_0007_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, you said Sakura went outside."[lr]::
73414::$$$message_0673_0007_0001$$$::"She really did. It looks like she left before you did, so it's already been two hours.[lr]::
73415::$$$message_0673_0007_0002$$$::I don't know what she thinks she's going to do in her state, but she probably won't listen to us now. Rider stopped me when I was about to go look for her, so I bet she feels ashamed of what she's doing."::
73416::$$$message_0673_0008_0000$$$::"Th-that's crazy talk! Sakura wouldn't keep secrets from..."[lr]::
73417::$$$message_0673_0008_0001$$$::I can't say for sure that isn't true.[lr]::
73418::$$$message_0673_0008_0002$$$::...Sakura's nightmares.[lr]::
73419::$$$message_0673_0008_0003$$$::I could never understand how Sakura feels about her steadily deteriorating health.::
73420::$$$message_0673_0009_0000$$$::"A-anyway, we need to bring her back! If we let her go out alone in her condition..."[lr]::
73421::$$$message_0673_0009_0001$$$::"More people will die. She'll suck up the magical energy from anyone around her, just like when she attacked me at school.[lr]::
73422::$$$message_0673_0009_0002$$$::Plus, remember how the Shadow didn't leave a single victim behind last night? She must've been really hungry."::
73423::$$$message_0673_0010_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka."[lr]::
73424::$$$message_0673_0010_0001$$$::She looks slightly away and goes quiet.[lr]::
73425::$$$message_0673_0010_0002$$$::Her eyes seem to say,[lr]::
73426::$$$message_0673_0010_0003$$$::"It's over, Shirou."::
73427::$$$message_0673_0011_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, you..."[lr]::
73428::$$$message_0673_0011_0001$$$::"I agree that we should look for Sakura.[lr]::
73429::$$$message_0673_0011_0002$$$::But if we find her and she isn't Sakura anymore, you know what we have to do."::
73430::$$$message_0673_0012_0000$$$::"That won't happen. Sakura, Sakura's still..."[lr]::
73431::$$$message_0673_0012_0001$$$::"Sane? Can't you tell she was at her limit? Give it a rest already, Shirou. If you keep covering for her, you'll be the one to die first[line2]"::
73432::$$$message_0673_0013_0000$$$::"Save the speculation. I'm going to bring her home, that's all. I'll argue with you after that's done, so shut up for now!"[lr]::
73433::$$$message_0673_0013_0001$$$::"Hey wait, Shirou!"::
73434::$$$message_0673_0014_0000$$$::I run down the hall.[lr]::
73435::$$$message_0673_0014_0001$$$::I don't even have time to wonder where Sakura is.[lr]::
73436::$$$message_0673_0014_0002$$$::"It's over, Shirou."[r][wsay canskip=1]::
73437::$$$message_0673_0014_0003$$$::I run with all my might, as if to deny what Tohsaka was saying.::
73438::$$$message_0673_0015_0000$$$::"Shirou. Are you going to look for Sakura?"[lr]::
73439::$$$message_0673_0015_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
73440::$$$message_0673_0015_0002$$$::But then,[lr]::
73441::$$$message_0673_0015_0003$$$::I hear an unexpected voice just as I reach for the door.::
73442::$$$message_0673_0016_0000$$$::...When did she show up?[lr]::
73443::$$$message_0673_0016_0001$$$::Illya's watching me from afar, as if there's a wall between us.::
73444::$$$message_0673_0017_0000$$$::"...Illya."[lr]::
73445::$$$message_0673_0017_0001$$$::"Answer me. Are you going to look for her?"[lr]::
73446::$$$message_0673_0017_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
73447::$$$message_0673_0017_0003$$$::I nod.[lr]::
73448::$$$message_0673_0017_0004$$$::Illya's voice is strained.[lr]::
73449::$$$message_0673_0017_0005$$$::Her resignation is different than Tohsaka's. Maybe she can feel exactly what Sakura's going through, as a fellow Holy Grail.::
73450::$$$message_0673_0018_0000$$$::"Okay. But Shirou, Sakura left on her own because she didn't want you to see her. She did it to protect you. She's scared and she doesn't want to die, but she wants to settle things on her own, as a Holy Grail.[lr]::
73451::$$$message_0673_0018_0001$$$::The Sakura you love is gone. She went out alone to erase herself."::
73452::$$$message_0673_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
73453::$$$message_0673_0019_0001$$$::Illya's eyes bore straight into mine.[lr]::
73454::$$$message_0673_0019_0002$$$::I return the gaze and shake my head firmly.[lr]::
73455::$$$message_0673_0019_0003$$$::I won't let it happen.[lr]::
73456::$$$message_0673_0019_0004$$$::Even if Sakura isn't herself anymore, there's only one thing for me to do.::
73457::$$$message_0673_0020_0000$$$::"...I see. Shirou, Sakura and I each have another self inside us. It's a version of me that you don't know, and a version of Sakura that isn't what you think.[lr]::
73458::$$$message_0673_0020_0001$$$::Sakura won't come back. Now that she's changed, she's a different person.[lr]::
73459::$$$message_0673_0020_0002$$$::Are you still afraid to kill her, Shirou?"::
73460::$$$message_0673_0021_0000$$$::Illya asks me a question,[lr]::
73461::$$$message_0673_0021_0001$$$::very quietly.[lr]::
73462::$$$message_0673_0021_0002$$$::The Holy Grail is something people created.[lr]::
73463::$$$message_0673_0021_0003$$$::She's telling me that it was made to be broken, so I shouldn't hesitate to destroy it.[lr]::
73464::$$$message_0673_0021_0004$$$::When Illya talks about herself like that, all I can hear is Sakura's name instead.::
73465::$$$message_0673_0022_0000$$$::"Shirou, I'll ask you one more time.[lr]::
73466::$$$message_0673_0022_0001$$$::Are you still going to look for Sakura?"[lr]::
73467::$$$message_0673_0022_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
73468::$$$message_0673_0022_0003$$$::I don't know what feelings are behind that question.[lr]::
73469::$$$message_0673_0022_0004$$$::So I answer as honestly as I can.::
73470::$$$message_0673_0023_0000$$$::"Yeah. I'm going to find her. Sakura is still Sakura to me. That goes for you too, Illya. You're still you even if you turn into something I don't understand."::
73471::$$$message_0673_0024_0000$$$::"No matter how this ends...[lr]::
73472::$$$message_0673_0024_0001$$$::If you're still somewhere in there, then you're the Illya I know."::
73473::$$$message_0673_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
73474::$$$message_0673_0025_0001$$$::"To be honest, it's hard for me to understand. But that's how I feel."::
73475::$$$message_0673_0026_0000$$$::I reach for the door.[lr]::
73476::$$$message_0673_0026_0001$$$::"...She went to find Zouken. That's the only place she would go."[lr]::
73477::$$$message_0673_0026_0002$$$::Her voice guides me from behind.[lr]::
73478::$$$message_0673_0026_0003$$$::"All right. Wait here at home, Illya. I'll bring Sakura back."::
73479::$$$message_0673_0027_0000$$$::I leave the house entrance.[lr]::
73480::$$$message_0673_0027_0001$$$::Illya keeps watching me go from afar.::
73481::$$$message_0673_0028_0000$$$::I arrive at the Matou mansion.[lr]::
73482::$$$message_0673_0028_0001$$$::I'm not winded at all.[lr]::
73483::$$$message_0673_0028_0002$$$::I should be tired after running this morning, but my body feels completely fine.::
73484::$$$message_0673_0029_0000$$$::"It's...open."[lr]::
73485::$$$message_0673_0029_0001$$$::My finger stops before ringing the doorbell.[lr]::
73486::$$$message_0673_0029_0002$$$::...Did someone enter or leave?[lr]::
73487::$$$message_0673_0029_0003$$$::The front door lies partly ajar, and the inside is terribly quiet.::
73488::$$$message_0673_0030_0000$$$::There's no sign of anyone here.[lr]::
73489::$$$message_0673_0030_0001$$$::The house is even more dreary than it was yesterday.::
73490::$$$message_0673_0031_0000$$$::I don't find anyone on the first floor.[lr]::
73491::$$$message_0673_0031_0001$$$::The only sound I hear is my echoing footsteps.[lr]::
73492::$$$message_0673_0031_0002$$$::I make my way upstairs, the floorboards creaking beneath me.::
73493::$$$message_0673_0032_0000$$$::The second floor is also empty.[lr]::
73494::$$$message_0673_0032_0001$$$::I gaze up at the sky through the skylight.[lr]::
73495::$$$message_0673_0032_0002$$$::I could sense that there was no one living here as soon as I went up the stairs.::
73496::$$$message_0673_0033_0000$$$::I stop myself before I go back downstairs.[lr]::
73497::$$$message_0673_0033_0001$$$::No one living.[lr]::
73498::$$$message_0673_0033_0002$$$::A sense of dread directs my attention to an open door.::
73499::$$$message_0673_0034_0000$$$::    It's Sakura's room.[lr]::
73500::$$$message_0673_0034_0001$$$::I've seen it once before.[lr]::
73501::$$$message_0673_0034_0002$$$::I've never been inside.[lr]::
73502::$$$message_0673_0034_0003$$$::When Shinji showed me around before, Sakura pushed us outside, blushing furiously.::
73503::$$$message_0673_0035_0000$$$::I think that was two years ago.[lr]::
73504::$$$message_0673_0035_0001$$$::Nothing's changed.[lr]::
73505::$$$message_0673_0035_0002$$$::It's a girly room, barely decorated at all, which is like Sakura.[lr]::
73506::$$$message_0673_0035_0003$$$::There...[lr]::
73507::$$$message_0673_0035_0004$$$::"...Shinji."[lr]::
73508::$$$message_0673_0035_0005$$$::Shinji's dead body is sprawled on the bed.::
