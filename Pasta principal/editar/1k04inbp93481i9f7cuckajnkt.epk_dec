71319::$$$message_0655_0000_0000$$$::Sakura is released.[lr]::
71320::$$$message_0655_0000_0001$$$::The black Command Spells wrapping her body crumble away.::
71321::$$$message_0655_0001_0000$$$::I used a dagger of contract-breaking.[lr]::
71322::$$$message_0655_0001_0001$$$::A Noble Phantasm that resets all magical effects and breaks Servants' contracts.[lr]::
71323::$$$message_0655_0001_0002$$$::It doesn't endanger Sakura's life. It only breaks the contract she was bound to.::
71324::$$$message_0655_0002_0000$$$::   The image doesn't continue.[lr]::
71325::$$$message_0655_0002_0001$$$::Sakura is alive.[lr]::
71326::$$$message_0655_0002_0002$$$::She goes limp. It must be the feedback from being released from the shadow.::
71327::$$$message_0655_0003_0000$$$::Tohsaka...Tohsaka will still make it.[lr]::
71328::$$$message_0655_0003_0001$$$::Her bleeding stopped. She has a proper Magic Crest.[lr]::
71329::$$$message_0655_0003_0002$$$::The Crest is a crystallization of the Tohsakas' inherited magecraft. Even if she loses consciousness, it won't allow its heir to die so easily.::
71330::$$$message_0655_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
71331::$$$message_0655_0004_0001$$$::The cavern is shaking.[lr]::
71332::$$$message_0655_0004_0002$$$::Aŋra Mainiiu.[lr]::
71333::$$$message_0655_0004_0003$$$::"All the Evil in the World," [font italic=true]please[font italic=false]. The ridiculous curse is writhing.::
71334::$$$message_0655_0005_0000$$$::...Damn it.[lr]::
71335::$$$message_0655_0005_0001$$$::The Shadow isn't disappearing, even though Sakura isn't its host anymore.[lr]::
71336::$$$message_0655_0005_0002$$$::It's grown too much.[lr]::
71337::$$$message_0655_0005_0003$$$::It's going to come out, even if Sakura is gone.[lr]::
71338::$$$message_0655_0005_0004$$$::As long as the Greater Grail exists, it'll come crawling out someday.::
71339::$$$message_0655_0006_0000$$$::    I'll destroy it.[lr]::
71340::$$$message_0655_0006_0001$$$::I'll break down this giant magic circle along with the Shadow.[lr]::
71341::$$$message_0655_0006_0002$$$::Aŋra Mainiiu's undulations are gradually collapsing the cavern.[lr]::
71342::$$$message_0655_0006_0003$$$::...But I don't think it'll disappear even if the cave comes down.[lr]::
71343::$$$message_0655_0006_0004$$$::I need to get rid of it once and for all, in here.::
71344::$$$message_0655_0007_0000$$$::Is that even possible?[lr]::
71345::$$$message_0655_0007_0001$$$::...Yeah. Nothing's impossible.[lr]::
71346::$$$message_0655_0007_0002$$$::I'll get as close as possible to its feet and blow it up with maximum firepower.::
71347::$$$message_0655_0008_0000$$$::Aŋra Mainiiu won't move as long as it's inside those black flames.[lr]::
71348::$$$message_0655_0008_0001$$$::While I still can, I need to cut it in half and return it to something that doesn't exist before it comes out.[lr]::
71349::$$$message_0655_0008_0002$$$::If there's a way to do it, it would be...[lr]::
71350::$$$message_0655_0008_0003$$$::To blow it away with the most powerful Noble Phantasm I know of.::
71351::$$$message_0655_0009_0000$$$::"...Cough."[lr]::
71352::$$$message_0655_0009_0001$$$::I'm not breathing.[lr]::
71353::$$$message_0655_0009_0002$$$::It's about a hundred meters to Aŋra Mainiiu's feet.[lr]::
71354::$$$message_0655_0009_0003$$$::...I'll be okay. It isn't an impossible distance to cover.[lr]::
71355::$$$message_0655_0009_0004$$$::One more time.[lr]::
71356::$$$message_0655_0009_0005$$$::I just need to do one more Projection, and everything will be settled.[lr]::
71357::$$$message_0655_0009_0006$$$::It's okay. I can do it.[lr]::
71358::$$$message_0655_0009_0007$$$::I'll clean this all up, and take them back[line2]::
71359::$$$message_0655_0010_0000$$$::"Can you hear me, Shirou?"[lr]::
71360::$$$message_0655_0010_0001$$$::A stranger taps me on the shoulder.::
71361::$$$message_0655_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
71362::$$$message_0655_0011_0001$$$::...Who was she again?[lr]::
71363::$$$message_0655_0011_0002$$$::She isn't a stranger.[lr]::
71364::$$$message_0655_0011_0003$$$::I know her well. She looks kinda scary, but I remember that this woman can be trusted.::
71365::$$$message_0655_0012_0000$$$::"Thanks. Can you take Tohsaka and Sakura back outside?"[lr]::
71366::$$$message_0655_0012_0001$$$::"...Shirou?"[lr]::
71367::$$$message_0655_0012_0002$$$::The long-haired woman looks at me for a few seconds, as if taking my measure.::
71368::$$$message_0655_0013_0000$$$::"What about you?"[lr]::
71369::$$$message_0655_0013_0001$$$::"I'm going to shut that thing off. I think it'll be quick, but Tohsaka's wound needs help soon. It's going to affect Sakura if she stays here. Aŋra Mainiiu might not have learned its lesson and still try to make her its Master."::
71370::$$$message_0655_0014_0000$$$::"...I understand. I will take Sakura and Rin.[lr]::
71371::$$$message_0655_0014_0001$$$::Be assured, I took the time to recover enough for that very purpose."[lr]::
71372::$$$message_0655_0014_0002$$$::"Thanks. Do what you can to get them out of here. The cave's gonna come down soon, right? Ri[line2]R-R[line2]damn it, anyway, I know you're fast enough to avoid any cave-ins."::
71373::$$$message_0655_0015_0000$$$::"..................[lr]::
71374::$$$message_0655_0015_0001$$$::...Then I will come get you once I move them to a safe place."::
71375::$$$message_0655_0016_0000$$$::"Ahh... I'd appreciate that, but you should prioritize their first aid. You're the only one I can count on. I'll be out real soon, so just heal Tohsaka. Sakura won't be happy unless she's around too."::
71376::$$$message_0655_0017_0000$$$::...Oh, I think this woman said she doesn't have any healing skills.[lr]::
71377::$$$message_0655_0017_0001$$$::Still, I have to trust that she'll take care of Tohsaka.::
71378::$$$message_0655_0018_0000$$$::"I promise. But that applies to you as well, Shirou.[lr]::
71379::$$$message_0655_0018_0001$$$::Sakura needs both you and Rin. Please try to remember that... I also do not approve of anyone other than you supporting Sakura."::
71380::$$$message_0655_0019_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
71381::$$$message_0655_0019_0001$$$::"I will hurry. I wish you luck."::
71382::$$$message_0655_0020_0000$$$::The black-clad woman easily picks up the two girls and runs down the slope.[lr]::
71383::$$$message_0655_0020_0001$$$::   She evades the crumbling ceiling, dashing for the exit.::
71384::$$$message_0655_0021_0000$$$::"...Phew."[lr]::
71385::$$$message_0655_0021_0001$$$::...I can rest easy.[lr]::
71386::$$$message_0655_0021_0002$$$::I know I can count on her to keep them safe.[lr]::
71387::$$$message_0655_0021_0003$$$::Next is...[lr]::
71388::$$$message_0655_0021_0004$$$::My final task.::
