14634::$$$message_0137_0000_0000$$$::Saber can take care of Caster.[lr]::
14635::$$$message_0137_0000_0001$$$::There's no Servant left that Saber can't defeat, and Saber should be good against Caster.[lr]::
14636::$$$message_0137_0000_0002$$$::Her strong Magic Resistance should make her a good choice against Caster, who is a mage.::
14637::$$$message_0137_0001_0000$$$::"Saber. Can you go?"[lr]::
14638::$$$message_0137_0001_0001$$$::"Yes. I should go alone if we only face Caster.[lr]::
14639::$$$message_0137_0001_0002$$$::You have made the right choice."[lr]::
14640::$$$message_0137_0001_0003$$$::"Okay. We'll try to hold down the fort. You just need to focus on defeating Caster."::
14641::$$$message_0137_0002_0000$$$::A strange sound reaches me just as I finish speaking.[lr]::
14642::$$$message_0137_0002_0001$$$::Is it...the sound of Saber tearing through Caster's familiars now that she's jumped out into the hall?::
14643::$$$message_0137_0003_0000$$$::"I'm hearing more of them now. Twenty...thirty...forty... They may be weak, but there's too many of them."::
14644::$$$message_0137_0004_0000$$$::"Shouldn't be a problem. Dragon Tooth Warriors are imitations. They don't stand a chance against Saber. She's the incarnation of a dragon. Even a hundred of them wouldn't be a match for her."::
14645::$$$message_0137_0005_0000$$$::The sounds retreat into the distance.[lr]::
14646::$$$message_0137_0005_0001$$$::The horde I felt surrounding the house is gone. I assume Saber defeated them all.::
14647::$$$message_0137_0006_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
14648::$$$message_0137_0006_0001$$$::Like Illya said, Caster's familiars can't stop Saber.[lr]::
14649::$$$message_0137_0006_0002$$$::They must not have made it in here because they couldn't get past Saber.::
14650::$$$message_0137_0007_0000$$$::"As expected...Saber found Caster.[lr]::
14651::$$$message_0137_0007_0001$$$::Caster's trying to recall all her familiars, but this looks like the end for her."::
14652::$$$message_0137_0008_0000$$$::If Illya's right, the battle should be over soon.[lr]::
14653::$$$message_0137_0008_0001$$$::Saber won't lose in single combat.[lr]::
14654::$$$message_0137_0008_0002$$$::She shouldn't have any trouble cutting Caster down since she doesn't have to worry about protecting us.::
14655::$$$message_0137_0009_0000$$$::"Why so glum? You look troubled, even though we're saying the fight's just about over."[lr]::
14656::$$$message_0137_0009_0001$$$::"I could say the same, Tohsaka. Why does it look like something's bothering you?"::
14657::$$$message_0137_0010_0000$$$::"Yeah...it just seems like things are going TOO well.[lr]::
14658::$$$message_0137_0010_0001$$$::Caster knows Saber is way more powerful, so...why just launch herself at us like this?"::
14659::$$$message_0137_0011_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
14660::$$$message_0137_0011_0001$$$::She's right.[lr]::
14661::$$$message_0137_0011_0002$$$::Caster came here willingly.[lr]::
14662::$$$message_0137_0011_0003$$$::If she knows that there's a Master here, she should already know which Servant is here too.[lr]::
14663::$$$message_0137_0011_0004$$$::So she knows that Saber is here, and that Saber is a bad matchup for her.[lr]::
14664::$$$message_0137_0011_0005$$$::...If she knew that and still attacked, that means[line2]::
14665::$$$message_0137_0012_0000$$$::"I don't hear anything. Illya, do you sense Caster's presence?"[lr]::
14666::$$$message_0137_0012_0001$$$::"It's gone. The familiars are still around, but the only Servant left is Saber."[lr]::
14667::$$$message_0137_0012_0002$$$::"There are still familiars left...?[lr]::
14668::$$$message_0137_0012_0003$$$::Look...! Shirou, your arm!"::
14669::$$$message_0137_0013_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
14670::$$$message_0137_0013_0001$$$::I look down at my left arm.[lr]::
14671::$$$message_0137_0013_0002$$$::I...don't understand what happened.[lr]::
14672::$$$message_0137_0013_0003$$$::My Command Spells, proof of my contract with Saber, are gone.::
14673::$$$message_0137_0014_0000$$$::"Shirou, did you use a Command Spell!?"[lr]::
14674::$$$message_0137_0014_0001$$$::"No. I didn't."[lr]::
14675::$$$message_0137_0014_0002$$$::"..."::
14676::$$$message_0137_0015_0000$$$::What's going on?[lr]::
14677::$$$message_0137_0015_0001$$$::Saber should've defeated Caster easily.[lr]::
14678::$$$message_0137_0015_0002$$$::So then why did my Command Spell disappear?[lr]::
14679::$$$message_0137_0015_0003$$$::No, my Command Spell disappearing doesn't mean my contract is severed. I shouldn't be panicking.::
14680::$$$message_0137_0016_0000$$$::Command Spells are there to control Servants who may act against their Master's orders.[lr]::
14681::$$$message_0137_0016_0001$$$::I haven't needed to use them for Saber.[lr]::
14682::$$$message_0137_0016_0002$$$::So even if I lose the Command Spells, Saber and I should be able to get along fine.::
14683::$$$message_0137_0017_0000$$$::"Saber's back. She'll be here soon."[lr]::
14684::$$$message_0137_0017_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
14685::$$$message_0137_0017_0002$$$::What are those two doing?[lr]::
14686::$$$message_0137_0017_0003$$$::Saber's just coming back, so why do they seem so worried?::
14687::$$$message_0137_0018_0000$$$::The door opens.[lr]::
14688::$$$message_0137_0018_0001$$$::Saber comes in.[lr]::
14689::$$$message_0137_0018_0002$$$::"Hngh...guh...!"[lr]::
14690::$$$message_0137_0018_0003$$$::Saber's gripping her chest. She seems to be in pain.::
14691::$$$message_0137_0019_0000$$$::"Saber!!!"[lr]::
14692::$$$message_0137_0019_0001$$$::I rush to her.[lr]::
14693::$$$message_0137_0019_0002$$$::"No! Wait, Shirou!"[lr]::
14694::$$$message_0137_0019_0003$$$::I don't hear Tohsaka's warning.[lr]::
14695::$$$message_0137_0019_0004$$$::All I see is that Saber is injured.[lr]::
14696::$$$message_0137_0019_0005$$$::"Are you okay, Saber? Where did you[line2]"::
14697::$$$message_0137_0020_0000$$$::"What...!? No, run, Shirou...![lr]::
14698::$$$message_0137_0020_0001$$$::Saber...stop[line2]"[lr]::
14699::$$$message_0137_0020_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
14700::$$$message_0137_0021_0000$$$::In a single stroke, my body is cut in half, from the shoulder to the waist.[lr]::
14701::$$$message_0137_0021_0001$$$::So quick is the slash that for a moment, I don't even feel pain. My mysterious healing abilities don't seem to work against the attack from Saber's sword.::
14702::$$$message_0137_0022_0000$$$::"...Sa...ber..."[lr]::
14703::$$$message_0137_0022_0001$$$::The world starts to go dark.[lr]::
14704::$$$message_0137_0022_0002$$$::As I die...[lr]::
14705::$$$message_0137_0022_0003$$$::...more than my fear of death, I find myself wondering why Saber attacked me.::
