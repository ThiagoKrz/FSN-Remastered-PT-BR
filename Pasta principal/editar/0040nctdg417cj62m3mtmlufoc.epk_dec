78326::$$$message_0727_0000_0000$$$::"All right, then..."[lr]::
78327::$$$message_0727_0000_0001$$$::I take a breath and consider our situation.[lr]::
78328::$$$message_0727_0000_0002$$$::Ever since last night, when I witnessed Lancer and Archer fighting at the school, I haven't had time to collect my thoughts.::
78329::$$$message_0727_0001_0000$$$::"...Oh, right. That means I saw Tohsaka back there."[lr]::
78330::$$$message_0727_0001_0001$$$::The realization comes way too late.::
78331::$$$message_0727_0002_0000$$$::After that, Lancer stabbed me through the chest, something or someone saved me and I went home, only to get attacked by Lancer again...[lr]::
78332::$$$message_0727_0002_0001$$$::"And that's when Saber saved me, and I became a Master."[lr]::
78333::$$$message_0727_0002_0002$$$::Everything I heard at the church...[lr]::
78334::$$$message_0727_0002_0003$$$::About the deathmatch they call the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
78335::$$$message_0727_0002_0004$$$::About a Holy Grail said to grant the victor any wish.::
78336::$$$message_0727_0003_0000$$$::It all sounds fantastical and still not quite real, but I've already been attacked three times.[lr]::
78337::$$$message_0727_0003_0001$$$::I can't stay bewildered forever.[lr]::
78338::$$$message_0727_0003_0002$$$::My entire purpose here was that I can't allow this battle to run amok.[lr]::
78339::$$$message_0727_0003_0003$$$::I won't let innocent people get hurt.::
78340::$$$message_0727_0004_0000$$$::Ever since that day ten years ago, I've been training in magecraft so that I can be a champion of justice.[lr]::
78341::$$$message_0727_0004_0001$$$::I never expected that I'd be tested in this way, but there's no going back.::
78342::$$$message_0727_0005_0000$$$::It's time to cast aside my doubts.[lr]::
78343::$$$message_0727_0005_0001$$$::This could also be an opportunity for me, as well.[lr]::
78344::$$$message_0727_0005_0002$$$::It's a chance for me to fight for someone else's sake, just like I've always wanted. Just like Kiritsugu Emiya did.[lr]::
78345::$$$message_0727_0005_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
78346::$$$message_0727_0005_0004$$$::But if there's one thing still bothering me...::
78347::$$$message_0727_0006_0000$$$::                                              [font italic=true]Rejoice, Shirou Emiya.[font italic=false]::
78348::$$$message_0727_0007_0000$$$::Your absurd, forbidden desire::
78349::$$$message_0727_0008_0000$$$::                                              [font italic=true]will finally be granted.[font italic=false]::
78350::$$$message_0727_0009_0000$$$::It made me wonder if always doing the right thing is actually a twisted way to live.::
78351::$$$message_0727_0010_0000$$$::"That can't be true. I never wanted this Holy Grail War to happen."[lr]::
78352::$$$message_0727_0010_0001$$$::...There's no room for doubt.[lr]::
78353::$$$message_0727_0010_0002$$$::The oath I swore ten years ago, that I trained every day to uphold, can't be wrong.[lr]::
78354::$$$message_0727_0010_0003$$$::Shirou Emiya always does the right thing.[lr]::
78355::$$$message_0727_0010_0004$$$::He trained in magecraft to prevent other people from dying needless deaths.::
78356::$$$message_0727_0011_0000$$$::"All right. I should talk to Saber first."[lr]::
78357::$$$message_0727_0011_0001$$$::I push aside the priest's words lingering in the back of my mind, and head into the hallway.::
78358::$$$message_0727_0012_0000$$$::I walk around the house.[lr]::
78359::$$$message_0727_0012_0001$$$::I checked all the guest rooms where people are likely to be, but Saber's nowhere to be found.::
78360::$$$message_0727_0013_0000$$$::"That's weird...the way she's dressed, I was sure I'd spot her right away."[lr]::
78361::$$$message_0727_0013_0001$$$::But sure enough, Saber's armored form is nowhere to be seen.[lr]::
78362::$$$message_0727_0013_0002$$$::Apparently, Servants can turn into invisible ghosts, but alas, I never learned how do to that trick.[lr]::
78363::$$$message_0727_0013_0003$$$::To begin with...::
78364::$$$message_0727_0014_0000$$$::"I call myself a Master, but I still don't know anything about her."::
78365::$$$message_0727_0015_0000$$$::I don't know anything about Saber. Not who she is or how Servants can even exist.[lr]::
78366::$$$message_0727_0015_0001$$$::All I know is...[lr]::
78367::$$$message_0727_0015_0002$$$::No matter how incredible she is, she can get hurt in a fight and bleed if you cut her.::
78368::$$$message_0727_0016_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
78369::$$$message_0727_0016_0001$$$::Saber is in the still, silent dojo.[lr]::
78370::$$$message_0727_0016_0002$$$::She looks different than she did yesterday.[lr]::
78371::$$$message_0727_0016_0003$$$::Sitting on her knees atop the wooden floor, she is not wearing her armor.[lr]::
78372::$$$message_0727_0016_0004$$$::She changed into rather elegant clothes that really suit her. Now she sits in wait.::
78373::$$$message_0727_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
78374::$$$message_0727_0017_0001$$$::...Words fail me at the sight.[lr]::
78375::$$$message_0727_0017_0002$$$::Saber looks beautiful. She strikes a refined, dignified figure as she sits there, eyes closed.[lr]::
78376::$$$message_0727_0017_0003$$$::Matching the stillness of the dojo, she reminds me of clear, pure water.::
78377::$$$message_0727_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
78378::$$$message_0727_0018_0001$$$::And that rids me of any further doubt in my mind.[lr]::
78379::$$$message_0727_0018_0002$$$::Servant or whatever it is, she seems sacrosanct.[lr]::
78380::$$$message_0727_0018_0003$$$::So... From now on, I'm sure I won't go down the wrong path.::
78381::$$$message_0727_0019_0000$$$::"Saber."[lr]::
78382::$$$message_0727_0019_0001$$$::I call to her.[lr]::
78383::$$$message_0727_0019_0002$$$::Saber calmly opens her eyes and slowly meets my gaze.::
78384::$$$message_0727_0020_0000$$$::"You're awake, Shirou."[lr]::
78385::$$$message_0727_0020_0001$$$::Her voice is serene.[lr]::
78386::$$$message_0727_0020_0002$$$::Something rich and calm about her voice hangs in the air.::
78387::$$$message_0727_0021_0000$$$::"Yeah. I just woke up. What are you doing here?"[lr]::
78388::$$$message_0727_0021_0001$$$::"I was resting. Since I cannot treat you, I figured that I would at least ensure that my body is in as perfect a condition as I can make it."::
78389::$$$message_0727_0022_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
78390::$$$message_0727_0022_0001$$$::Saber gives a straightforward response as she scrutinizes me.[lr]::
78391::$$$message_0727_0022_0002$$$::...This is, um...[lr]::
78392::$$$message_0727_0022_0003$$$::Making me nervous in a different way than Tohsaka did.::
78393::$$$message_0727_0023_0000$$$::"Shirou? What is it? Is your body still...?"[lr]::
78394::$$$message_0727_0023_0001$$$::"N-no, I'm totally fine...! It's something else, really, it's nothing...!"[lr]::
78395::$$$message_0727_0023_0002$$$::I quickly take a step back and shake my head.::
78396::$$$message_0727_0024_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
78397::$$$message_0727_0024_0001$$$::Looking away from Saber[line2]who tilts her head at me quizzically[line2]I try to calm my rapid heartbeat.::
78398::$$$message_0727_0025_0000$$$::"Get a hold of yourself! Why are you getting worked up like this...!"[lr]::
78399::$$$message_0727_0025_0001$$$::I take a deep breath.[lr]::
78400::$$$message_0727_0025_0002$$$::...But I don't think this feeling is going away anytime soon.[lr]::
78401::$$$message_0727_0025_0003$$$::"...Man, why did she have to change...?"::
78402::$$$message_0727_0026_0000$$$::I can't help myself.[lr]::
78403::$$$message_0727_0026_0001$$$::With Saber in that outfit, I can't help but actually think she's real now. ::
78404::$$$message_0727_0027_0000$$$::...Seriously, she's drop-dead gorgeous.[lr]::
78405::$$$message_0727_0027_0001$$$::I mean I saw that yesterday, but it's actually setting in now.::
78406::$$$message_0727_0028_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
78407::$$$message_0727_0028_0001$$$::As soon as we make eye contact I can feel my nervousness grow.[lr]::
78408::$$$message_0727_0028_0002$$$::Then again, I wasn't looking everywhere for her just to stay silent. It's uncomfortable, but I can't let it be awkward forever.::
78409::$$$message_0727_0029_0000$$$::"All right.[lr]::
78410::$$$message_0727_0029_0001$$$::May I, Saber? This is the first time for us to sit down and actually figure things out, but..."[lr]::
78411::$$$message_0727_0029_0002$$$::I bite the bullet.[lr]::
78412::$$$message_0727_0029_0003$$$::But then...::
78413::$$$message_0727_0030_0000$$$::"Shirou. Before that, there is something that I would address regarding last night."[lr]::
78414::$$$message_0727_0030_0001$$$::Saber interrupts me, her serenity replaced by irritation.::
78415::$$$message_0727_0031_0000$$$::"Mm? That's fine, but what is it?"::
78416::$$$message_0727_0032_0000$$$::"As I said, about last night.[lr]::
78417::$$$message_0727_0032_0001$$$::You are my Master. It is troubling if you take such actions. Combat is my area of expertise, while your role is to fall back when the fighting breaks out. I cannot protect you if you throw yourself to your death."::
78418::$$$message_0727_0033_0000$$$::Saber doesn't mince words.[lr]::
78419::$$$message_0727_0033_0001$$$::Her clipped tone is enough to make me forget my anxiety.::
78420::$$$message_0727_0034_0000$$$::"Wh-what the hell! If I hadn't intervened, you'd have been cut in half!"::
78421::$$$message_0727_0035_0000$$$::"Perhaps I would have died. But you would not have been hurt.[lr]::
78422::$$$message_0727_0035_0001$$$::Let me repeat myself. Do not do that again.[lr]::
78423::$$$message_0727_0035_0002$$$::My Master need not defend me, nor is there any reason to do so."[lr]::
78424::$$$message_0727_0035_0003$$$::She says it dispassionately.[lr]::
78425::$$$message_0727_0035_0004$$$::Like it's just business.::
78426::$$$message_0727_0036_0000$$$::"Wha... Don't be stupid! I don't need a reason to protect a girl!"[lr]::
78427::$$$message_0727_0036_0001$$$::I snap back out of reflex.::
78428::$$$message_0727_0037_0000$$$::Saber stiffens, as if surprised to see me upset at her.[lr]::
78429::$$$message_0727_0037_0001$$$::Then her look becomes one of indescribable dignity.::
78430::$$$message_0727_0038_0000$$$::"Uh..."[lr]::
78431::$$$message_0727_0038_0001$$$::I find myself taking a step back under her severe expression.[lr]::
78432::$$$message_0727_0038_0002$$$::Now I just feel embarrassed, like I've said something incredibly tone-deaf.::
78433::$$$message_0727_0039_0000$$$::"A-anyway, thanks for taking me home. I appreciate that."::
78434::$$$message_0727_0040_0000$$$::I turn around and thank her.[lr]::
78435::$$$message_0727_0040_0001$$$::...It's embarrassing enough to thank her like this, but in this situation it feels even more awkward.[lr]::
78436::$$$message_0727_0040_0002$$$::Even so, it's only right to thank the person who saved my life.::
78437::$$$message_0727_0041_0000$$$::"You are most welcome. It is a Servant's duty to protect their Master, but it is still nice to be acknowledged. You are very courteous, Shirou."[lr]::
78438::$$$message_0727_0041_0001$$$::"I don't think I'm particularly polite, actually."::
78439::$$$message_0727_0042_0000$$$::There's something more pressing that I need to bring up.[lr]::
78440::$$$message_0727_0042_0001$$$::Something I should have asked as soon as I got home yesterday.[lr]::
78441::$$$message_0727_0042_0002$$$::Is she willing to be my Servant, and is she really all right with[lr]::
78442::$$$message_0727_0042_0003$$$::fighting with me in this war?::
78443::$$$message_0727_0043_0000$$$::"Let's get back on topic, Saber.[lr]::
78444::$$$message_0727_0043_0001$$$::Oh, um, I [font italic=true]can[font italic=false] call you Saber, right?"::
78445::$$$message_0727_0044_0000$$$::"Yes. As a Servant who has formed a contract with you, I am your sword. I shall follow your orders, attack your enemies, and protect you."[lr]::
78446::$$$message_0727_0044_0001$$$::Saber does not hesitate in the slightest to give her answer.[lr]::
78447::$$$message_0727_0044_0002$$$::Her tone leaves no room for doubt.::
78448::$$$message_0727_0045_0000$$$::"You are my sword, huh? To win the Holy Grail thing?"[lr]::
78449::$$$message_0727_0045_0001$$$::"Is that not why you summoned me?"::
78450::$$$message_0727_0046_0000$$$::"No, actually. It was just a coincidence.[lr]::
78451::$$$message_0727_0046_0001$$$::You may have figured this out, but I'm not a full-fledged mage. I'm sorry, but I have no real knowledge or power as a Master.[lr]::
78452::$$$message_0727_0046_0002$$$::But, now that I've decided to, I'll fight. I'm inexperienced as a Master, but are you okay with that?"::
78453::$$$message_0727_0047_0000$$$::"Of course I am. You are my Master, Shirou.[lr]::
78454::$$$message_0727_0047_0001$$$::That is an immutable fact. Servants do not have the freedom to choose their Masters."[lr]::
78455::$$$message_0727_0047_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
78456::$$$message_0727_0047_0003$$$::I didn't know that.[lr]::
78457::$$$message_0727_0047_0004$$$::If it's true, I'll need to respect Saber's needs and actions as best I can.::
78458::$$$message_0727_0048_0000$$$::"...Got it. So you're fine with me being your Master, Saber?"::
78459::$$$message_0727_0049_0000$$$::"Yes. However, Shirou, I will not allow defeat.[lr]::
78460::$$$message_0727_0049_0001$$$::If you do not have any chance, it is my duty to carve out a path to victory. I will use any means possible to have you win the Holy Grail.[lr]::
78461::$$$message_0727_0049_0002$$$::We Servants do not serve our Masters out of charity. We serve you because we also desire the Holy Grail."::
78462::$$$message_0727_0050_0000$$$::"...Huh? Hold on, you mean you want the Holy Grail too...!?"::
78463::$$$message_0727_0051_0000$$$::"Of course. Originally, the only ones who can touch the Holy Grail's spiritual form are Servants, who are also spirits.[lr]::
78464::$$$message_0727_0051_0001$$$::The Master who is victorious in the Holy Grail War will obtain the Holy Grail through their Servant. Afterwards, the Servant's wish will be granted in repayment.[lr]::
78465::$$$message_0727_0051_0002$$$::That is the nature of the relationship between Servant and Master."::
78466::$$$message_0727_0052_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
78467::$$$message_0727_0052_0001$$$::...Oh.[lr]::
78468::$$$message_0727_0052_0002$$$::Come to think of it, there's no reason these absurdly strong Heroic Spirits would listen to humans, normally.[lr]::
78469::$$$message_0727_0052_0003$$$::They have their own reasons for serving Masters.::
78470::$$$message_0727_0053_0000$$$::Which means Saber has a wish she wants granted.[lr]::
78471::$$$message_0727_0053_0001$$$::That's why she does not hesitate.[lr]::
78472::$$$message_0727_0053_0002$$$::But, that is...::
78473::$$$message_0727_0054_0000$$$::"...Hold on, Saber.[lr]::
78474::$$$message_0727_0054_0001$$$::You said any means possible, right? Does that mean you..."::
78475::$$$message_0727_0055_0000$$$::I'm reminded of what the priest said.[lr]::
78476::$$$message_0727_0055_0001$$$::He said that people who have nothing to do with Masters would be drawn into the conflict, and the tragedy of ten years ago would be repeated...::
78477::$$$message_0727_0056_0000$$$::"Shirou, that is not what I mean by any means possible.[lr]::
78478::$$$message_0727_0056_0001$$$::I can only do things I allow myself to. It is impossible for me to betray my own beliefs. Harming unarmed innocents goes against a knight's oath."::
78479::$$$message_0727_0057_0000$$$::"However, I must obey if you order so. In that case, you will have to use one of your Command Spells in compensation."[lr]::
78480::$$$message_0727_0057_0001$$$::I get overwhelmed by the edge in her voice.::
78481::$$$message_0727_0058_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
78482::$$$message_0727_0058_0001$$$::At the same time, I feel relief flooding through me.[lr]::
78483::$$$message_0727_0058_0002$$$::Saber seemed like a robot because of her extraordinary power and lack of hesitation, but I know now she's not some cold-blooded killer.::
78484::$$$message_0727_0059_0000$$$::"...Yeah, I wouldn't make you do anything like that.[lr]::
78485::$$$message_0727_0059_0001$$$::Just as you say, we have to do our best with what we can do... I'm really sorry. What I said must've been insulting."::
78486::$$$message_0727_0060_0000$$$::"Ah... No, I also failed to grasp your intentions and jumped to conclusions. You are not at fault, so may you please raise your head...?"[lr]::
78487::$$$message_0727_0060_0001$$$::"Huh? Oh, I bowed without realizing it."[lr]::
78488::$$$message_0727_0060_0002$$$::I raise my head.::
78489::$$$message_0727_0061_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
78490::$$$message_0727_0061_0001$$$::I don't know what's so funny, but Saber has a small smile on her face.::
78491::$$$message_0727_0062_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
78492::$$$message_0727_0062_0001$$$::I'm glad she seems happy, so I don't press her.::
78493::$$$message_0727_0063_0000$$$::"Okay then, can I ask one more thing?[lr]::
78494::$$$message_0727_0063_0001$$$::You said Masters are mages who summon Servants, right?[lr]::
78495::$$$message_0727_0063_0002$$$::I get that, but I still don't quite understand your side of things. I do know that like Saber and Lancer aren't your real names, though."::
78496::$$$message_0727_0064_0000$$$::"Yes, those are only names that are given based on each of our roles... All right, I shall use this as an opportunity to give a rough explanation."::
78497::$$$message_0727_0065_0000$$$::"We Servants are Heroic Spirits.[lr]::
78498::$$$message_0727_0065_0001$$$::Each of us made a name for ourselves in our respective time periods; we accomplished some great deed beyond human capabilities.[lr]::
78499::$$$message_0727_0065_0002$$$::Whatever the means, we are beings who have sublimated to deity-esque status."::
78500::$$$message_0727_0066_0000$$$::That much is obvious.[lr]::
78501::$$$message_0727_0066_0001$$$::Heroic Spirits had supernatural abilities while they were alive, were celebrated after their deaths, and promoted to a higher spiritual rank than a ghost or such.::
78502::$$$message_0727_0067_0000$$$::"But at the same time, that is also our weakness. Because Heroic Spirits each left a mark upon history, our weaknesses were also recorded.[lr]::
78503::$$$message_0727_0067_0001$$$::By revealing our names and identities, we would be revealing our weaknesses.[lr]::
78504::$$$message_0727_0067_0002$$$::It is no problem if the enemy is spiritually inferior, but we are all Heroic Spirits that have the power to kill each other. If our weaknesses are revealed, the enemy would take advantage of that to defeat us." ::
78505::$$$message_0727_0068_0000$$$::"...I see. Heroes usually do have some opponent that they are weak against. So that's why you're using a name like Saber and concealing your real name."::
78506::$$$message_0727_0069_0000$$$::"Yes. However, that is not the only reason I am called Saber.[lr]::
78507::$$$message_0727_0069_0001$$$::There are seven Servants who were called forth by the Holy Grail, and each of them are all selected according to their class."::
78508::$$$message_0727_0070_0000$$$::"Class...? So that's where Saber and Archer come from?"::
78509::$$$message_0727_0071_0000$$$::"That is correct. First of all, summoning a Heroic Spirit is itself close to a miracle. To summon seven of them is too much even for the Holy Grail.[lr]::
78510::$$$message_0727_0071_0001$$$::In order to solve that, the Holy Grail prepares seven vessels beforehand and only calls forth Heroic Spirits who are compatible with those vessels. Such vessels are like objects that keep us temporarily bound to this world.[lr]::
78511::$$$message_0727_0071_0002$$$::Those are the seven classes: ::
78512::$$$message_0727_0072_0000$$$::Saber,[lr]::
78513::$$$message_0727_0072_0001$$$::Lancer,[lr]::
78514::$$$message_0727_0072_0002$$$::Archer,[lr]::
78515::$$$message_0727_0072_0003$$$::Rider,[lr]::
78516::$$$message_0727_0072_0004$$$::Caster,[lr]::
78517::$$$message_0727_0072_0005$$$::Assassin,[lr]::
78518::$$$message_0727_0072_0006$$$::and Berserker.::
78519::$$$message_0727_0073_0000$$$::"The Holy Grail calls forth Heroic Spirits with abilities that correspond to each role from any time period. [lr]::
78520::$$$message_0727_0073_0001$$$::And those who are assigned to these classes are called Servants."::
78521::$$$message_0727_0074_0000$$$::"...I get it. So you're a Saber because you're a Heroic Spirit who was good with a sword."[lr]::
78522::$$$message_0727_0074_0001$$$::"Correct. There may be some Heroic Spirits who possess multiple attributes, but I would say in all humility that there are none better than I with the sword."::
78523::$$$message_0727_0075_0000$$$::"However, that is also my disadvantage.[lr]::
78524::$$$message_0727_0075_0001$$$::I am not a mage, so I can only defeat enemies as your sword."::
78525::$$$message_0727_0076_0000$$$::"You mean you're not good at the cloak and dagger stuff. I don't consider that a weakness. You're more than strong enough as a Saber."::
78526::$$$message_0727_0077_0000$$$::"Shirou, battles are not won through might alone.[lr]::
78527::$$$message_0727_0077_0001$$$::This is hypothetical, but if your enemy is better at close combat than you, then what would you do?"::
78528::$$$message_0727_0078_0000$$$::"Huh? Well, I guess... I know that I wouldn't be able to win if I just fight head-on, so I would have to do something without fighting..."::
78529::$$$message_0727_0079_0000$$$::I understand once I say that.[lr]::
78530::$$$message_0727_0079_0001$$$::If their opponent is strong, they're not going to fight fair.[lr]::
78531::$$$message_0727_0079_0002$$$::Defeating opponents with a sword isn't the only way to fight.[lr]::
78532::$$$message_0727_0079_0003$$$::If you can't beat your opponent with a sword, you just have to come up with another way.::
78533::$$$message_0727_0080_0000$$$::"That is correct. If your opponent discovers that you are skilled in close combat, then they will most likely not challenge you thusly. In that sense, Servants who lack ability will use any means possible."::
78534::$$$message_0727_0081_0000$$$::"The Assassin Servant lacks combat capacity but has the ability to hide its presence, and the Caster Servant is proficient in magecraft that does not exist in this age.[lr]::
78535::$$$message_0727_0081_0001$$$::You cannot be optimistic from power difference. Additionally, we have things called 'Noble Phantasms.' No matter what kind of Servant we are, as Heroic Spirits, we have the opportunity to create a fatal attack."::
78536::$$$message_0727_0082_0000$$$::"Noble Phantasm...?"[lr]::
78537::$$$message_0727_0082_0001$$$::I've not heard the term.[lr]::
78538::$$$message_0727_0082_0002$$$::Though I think I can glean the meaning from the words.::
78539::$$$message_0727_0083_0000$$$::"Noble Phantasms are special weapons that Servants have.[lr]::
78540::$$$message_0727_0083_0001$$$::Weapons like Lancer's spear, Archer's bow, and my sword are all such treasured tools.[lr]::
78541::$$$message_0727_0083_0002$$$::Heroes do not become so by themselves. It is due to their chosen weapon, the very symbol of their existence, that they are recognized as heroes."::
78542::$$$message_0727_0084_0000$$$::"Heroes and their armaments are one. As such, those who become Heroic Spirits bear famed and powerful weapons.[lr]::
78543::$$$message_0727_0084_0001$$$::That is what Noble Phantasms are: a Servant's trump card. They are also what we need to fear most."::
78544::$$$message_0727_0085_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
78545::$$$message_0727_0085_0001$$$::...Saber says that Noble Phantasms are weapons that Heroic Spirits had while they were alive.::
78546::$$$message_0727_0086_0000$$$::I recall that blue knight's spear.[lr]::
78547::$$$message_0727_0086_0001$$$::It sucked up all the magical energy in the air and stabbed Saber's chest with an impossible trajectory.[lr]::
78548::$$$message_0727_0086_0002$$$::That thing is certainly not something that a normal human can handle.[lr]::
78549::$$$message_0727_0086_0003$$$::The spear itself carried a strong curse, but I felt an amount of magical energy on another level from the words Lancer said back then too.[lr]::
78550::$$$message_0727_0086_0004$$$::Could that be...::
78551::$$$message_0727_0087_0000$$$::"Saber. Are Noble Phantasms magecraft?[lr]::
78552::$$$message_0727_0087_0001$$$::Lancer's spear certainly seemed like something from history, but it was still essentially a spear.[lr]::
78553::$$$message_0727_0087_0002$$$::But with his words, the spear went beyond the realm of weapons. Isn't that a type of magecraft?"::
78554::$$$message_0727_0088_0000$$$::"Yes, Noble Phantasms are certainly similar to magecraft.[lr]::
78555::$$$message_0727_0088_0001$$$::As you say, Lancer's spear. It is a Noble Phantasm, but its true value is demonstrated only when he puts magical energy into it and says its True Name."::
78556::$$$message_0727_0089_0000$$$::"Noble Phantasms are technically Mystics that have materialized.[lr]::
78557::$$$message_0727_0089_0001$$$::Just as incantations are necessary to activate magecraft, Noble Phantasms also need their True Name to be recited in order to awaken and activate them.[lr]::
78558::$$$message_0727_0089_0002$$$::However, this also has its dangers. By saying the True Name of the Noble Phantasm, that Servant's identity will be revealed."::
78559::$$$message_0727_0090_0000$$$::"I get it. Heroes and weapons are a set. If you know the name of the weapon, you can work out who wields it."[lr]::
78560::$$$message_0727_0090_0001$$$::Saber nods in silence.::
78561::$$$message_0727_0091_0000$$$::That is why the Noble Phantasm is a trump card.[lr]::
78562::$$$message_0727_0091_0001$$$::In exchange for revealing the identity, it would launch an unavoidable fatal blow.[lr]::
78563::$$$message_0727_0091_0002$$$::And if that attack misses or fails, the Servant has revealed their weaknesses.::
78564::$$$message_0727_0092_0000$$$::"So, Saber. Is your Noble Phantasm that invisible sword?"::
78565::$$$message_0727_0093_0000$$$::"...Yes. However, I have not revealed its identity yet. At this point, there should not be any Servants who know my True Name."[lr]::
78566::$$$message_0727_0093_0001$$$::With that, Saber looks away uncomfortably for a second.::
78567::$$$message_0727_0094_0000$$$::"Shirou. I have a request about that matter."[lr]::
78568::$$$message_0727_0094_0001$$$::"Huh? What kind of request?"::
78569::$$$message_0727_0095_0000$$$::"It's about my True Name. Normally Servants reveal their True Name only to their Master, so they can plan strategies for the battles ahead.[lr]::
78570::$$$message_0727_0095_0001$$$::However, you are inexperienced as a mage.[lr]::
78571::$$$message_0727_0095_0002$$$::If you encounter a superior mage, they should be able to read your mind. Therefore..."::
78572::$$$message_0727_0096_0000$$$::"Ah, so you can't reveal your name, huh? Yeah, you're right. Like hypnosis or being hit with a Whisper-type spell, or... Well, I doubt it, but if other Masters have Mystic Eyes, then I might start babbling about it.[lr]::
78573::$$$message_0727_0096_0001$$$::Okay then. I'll leave it up to you to decide when to use your Noble Phantasm."::
78574::$$$message_0727_0097_0000$$$::"Ah... Are you certain you should make such a rash decision?"[lr]::
78575::$$$message_0727_0097_0001$$$::"It's not rash. I thought it over, and I'm satisfied by the conclusion I reached.[lr]::
78576::$$$message_0727_0097_0002$$$::I did think it through, so don't worry."[lr]::
78577::$$$message_0727_0097_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
78578::$$$message_0727_0098_0000$$$::Moving on.[lr]::
78579::$$$message_0727_0098_0001$$$::We've talked through most things, but I still don't think I understand the whole situation.::
78580::$$$message_0727_0099_0000$$$::Come to think of it, it's strange.[lr]::
78581::$$$message_0727_0099_0001$$$::I decided to fight, yet the only opponent that I know of is Tohsaka, and I have no intention of fighting her at all.[lr]::
78582::$$$message_0727_0099_0002$$$::...Well actually, she's ready to fight me, so I guess I'm not the one in a position to say that.::
78583::$$$message_0727_0100_0000$$$::"Hey Saber. Do Masters or Servants have some sort of mark? I don't really know what I should be doing."::
78584::$$$message_0727_0101_0000$$$::"No, unfortunately there is no definitive way to identify them.[lr]::
78585::$$$message_0727_0101_0001$$$::But if other Servants are near, a Servant can sense their presence. All the more so if they are in physical form. Servants themselves are a powerful force of magical energy.[lr]::
78586::$$$message_0727_0101_0002$$$::You were able to sense Berserker's presence, correct?"::
78587::$$$message_0727_0102_0000$$$::"Ugh... That's true. It would be bad if I can only tell once I'm attacked, right? I need to at least notice before they approach, or else I won't be able to take some kind of countermeasure."::
78588::$$$message_0727_0103_0000$$$::"Then, how about tracking the Master's presence? Masters are mages. Since they use magecraft as a living, there will always be magical energy that is leaked. If you search for that, you may be able to identify the Masters about."[lr]::
78589::$$$message_0727_0103_0001$$$::"...Sorry. Unfortunately, I can't do anything requiring skills like that."::
78590::$$$message_0727_0104_0000$$$::I mean, I didn't even realize Tohsaka's identity, and we go to the same school.[lr]::
78591::$$$message_0727_0104_0001$$$::We were in the same building for two years, and on top of that, I saw her many times.::
78592::$$$message_0727_0105_0000$$$::"...Damn. No wonder I get made fun of for being an amateur. My only proof as Master is my Command Spell. It looks like I have a tough road ahead of me."[lr]::
78593::$$$message_0727_0105_0001$$$::I sigh heavily.[lr]::
78594::$$$message_0727_0105_0002$$$::   And then,::
78595::$$$message_0727_0106_0000$$$::"Shirou. Can you close your eyes for a moment?"[lr]::
78596::$$$message_0727_0106_0001$$$::Saber's face is stern as she speaks.[lr]::
78597::$$$message_0727_0106_0002$$$::"Hm...? Close my eyes? Why?"[lr]::
78598::$$$message_0727_0106_0003$$$::"I am going to prove that you are a Master. Just listen to me. Close your eyes and regulate your breathing."::
78599::$$$message_0727_0107_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
78600::$$$message_0727_0107_0001$$$::...I close my eyes.[lr]::
78601::$$$message_0727_0107_0002$$$::I feel something slightly touching my forehead.[lr]::
78602::$$$message_0727_0107_0003$$$::    Wait, it's oddly pointed, could it be the end of her sword...!?::
78603::$$$message_0727_0108_0000$$$::"...Saber? Hold on, are you sure you're not doing anything weird?"[lr]::
78604::$$$message_0727_0108_0001$$$::"...Master, please be quiet and concentrate on my fingertip. If you are a mage, you should be able to feel my magical energy from that."::
78605::$$$message_0727_0109_0000$$$::"...Mrgh."[lr]::
78606::$$$message_0727_0109_0001$$$::Oh, so it's Saber's finger touching me.[lr]::
78607::$$$message_0727_0109_0002$$$::I pull myself together and quiet my mind.::
78608::$$$message_0727_0110_0000$$$::   Whoa.[lr]::
78609::$$$message_0727_0110_0001$$$::What is this?::
78610::$$$message_0727_0111_0000$$$::"Saber, what was that?"[lr]::
78611::$$$message_0727_0111_0001$$$::"Is it not obvious? You and I are connected through a contract, so it is natural to understand my condition."::
78612::$$$message_0727_0112_0000$$$::"Understand your condition...?"[lr]::
78613::$$$message_0727_0112_0001$$$::"I do not know how you saw it. Your standards are what sets how you measure a Servant's ability. There are some Masters who distinguish simply through colors, and there are other Masters who understand by comparing them to beasts."::
78614::$$$message_0727_0113_0000$$$::"In other words, it varies by person, but one perceives it in the easiest way for them to identify.[lr]::
78615::$$$message_0727_0113_0001$$$::This is a fundamental part of being a Master, so from now on, please check frequently. You should be able to understand the details of someone after seeing them once."::
78616::$$$message_0727_0114_0000$$$::...I think I get it now.[lr]::
78617::$$$message_0727_0114_0001$$$::I was surprised because it was so sudden, but I might be able to act a bit more like a Master now.¨rö
