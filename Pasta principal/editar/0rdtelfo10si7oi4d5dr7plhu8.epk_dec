77107::$$$message_0718_0000_0001$$$::This isn't something I should be agonizing over.[lr]::
77108::$$$message_0718_0000_0002$$$::I'm an amateur, while Tohsaka is a first-rate mage and Master.[lr]::
77109::$$$message_0718_0000_0003$$$::Given what happened last night, teaming up with her is clearly the wiser choice.::
77110::$$$message_0718_0001_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
77111::$$$message_0718_0001_0001$$$::...My hand goes to where I was slashed across the abdomen.[lr]::
77112::$$$message_0718_0001_0002$$$::It's been secured with bandages, but even the slightest touch sends waves of pain and nausea through me.::
77113::$$$message_0718_0002_0000$$$::...Makes sense.[lr]::
77114::$$$message_0718_0002_0001$$$::I wasn't just eviscerated; my body was almost cut in half.[lr]::
77115::$$$message_0718_0002_0002$$$::I'm only alive thanks to Tohsaka and Saber. As long as Berserker is after me, I'm as sure as dead the next time we meet.::
77116::$$$message_0718_0003_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
77117::$$$message_0718_0003_0001$$$::Something still bothers me, though,::
77118::$$$message_0718_0004_0000$$$::about that slate-skinned giant Berserker.[lr]::
77119::$$$message_0718_0004_0001$$$::That pale little girl commands the strongest Servant.[lr]::
77120::$$$message_0718_0004_0002$$$::Illyasviel von Einzbern.[lr]::
77121::$$$message_0718_0004_0003$$$::I'm pretty sure I heard Shinji's grandpa say that name.::
77122::$$$message_0718_0005_0000$$$::"Emiya. I want to hear your answer."[lr]::
77123::$$$message_0718_0005_0001$$$::"Huh? Oh, sorry. I was thinking about that Illya girl.[lr]::
77124::$$$message_0718_0005_0002$$$::If I team up with you, that means we'll fight her."::
77125::$$$message_0718_0006_0000$$$::"Yeah. If she comes after us, then we'll respond in kind.[lr]::
77126::$$$message_0718_0006_0001$$$::We have to defeat all the other Masters, sooner or later. If that's how Illyasviel wants to play, then we'll shoot to kill as well."::
77127::$$$message_0718_0007_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
77128::$$$message_0718_0007_0001$$$::Tohsaka's determination is firm.[lr]::
77129::$$$message_0718_0007_0002$$$::To her, that little girl is simply an enemy to be defeated.[lr]::
77130::$$$message_0718_0007_0003$$$::But...[lr]::
77131::$$$message_0718_0007_0004$$$::I don't want to fight her, even though I know that makes me sound like an idiot.::
77132::$$$message_0718_0008_0000$$$::"Emiya? I hope you aren't fooled by Illyasviel's appearance."[lr]::
77133::$$$message_0718_0008_0001$$$::Tohsaka fixes me with a glare.::
77134::$$$message_0718_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77135::$$$message_0718_0009_0001$$$::She sure is sharp.[lr]::
77136::$$$message_0718_0009_0002$$$::It's not like I'm doing it on purpose, but maybe what she looks like is getting to me.::
77137::$$$message_0718_0010_0000$$$::...She's Berserker's Master.[lr]::
77138::$$$message_0718_0010_0001$$$::She'd need to be a next-level mage to command such a strong Servant. That means her apparent physical age might be misleading.[lr]::
77139::$$$message_0718_0010_0002$$$::It might be, and yet...::
77140::$$$message_0718_0011_0000$$$::"...Sorry, Tohsaka.[lr]::
77141::$$$message_0718_0011_0001$$$::I appreciate your concern, but I can't give you the answer you want. As heavy as this whole thing is, I don't think I should just jump to a decision here."[lr]::
77142::$$$message_0718_0011_0002$$$::I meet her glare and dig my proverbial heels in.[lr]::
77143::$$$message_0718_0011_0003$$$::Tohsaka slightly narrows her eyes, then gives an emotionless nod.::
77144::$$$message_0718_0012_0000$$$::"Then I guess that's it. Though you're right about one thing. If you really want to win, you can't trust anyone."[lr]::
77145::$$$message_0718_0012_0001$$$::"That isn't true. I trust you, Tohsaka. I just don't think I can make this decision on my own. If I'm Saber's Master, then I shouldn't make commitments without looping her in."::
77146::$$$message_0718_0013_0000$$$::"I see. You're right. You are a Master now."::
77147::$$$message_0718_0014_0000$$$::Tohsaka nods again in acceptance and quickly turns away.[lr]::
77148::$$$message_0718_0014_0001$$$::Her long hair sways as she walks away.::
77149::$$$message_0718_0015_0000$$$::With that, the girl who might have been my ally turns back...[lr]::
77150::$$$message_0718_0015_0001$$$::"See you around. Next time, we'll meet as enemies."[lr]::
77151::$$$message_0718_0015_0002$$$::...and leaves me with a cold warning, just like Illya did.Í48H
