58886::$$$message_0528_0000_0000$$$::I walk up the stone steps.[lr]::
58887::$$$message_0528_0000_0001$$$::Saber is already armed.::
58888::$$$message_0528_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58889::$$$message_0528_0001_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58890::$$$message_0528_0001_0002$$$::Both of us are tense, expecting an enemy to attack at any moment.[lr]::
58891::$$$message_0528_0001_0003$$$::The stairway up to the mountain gate is long, and the breeze is pleasantly warm despite us being in the hills.::
58892::$$$message_0528_0002_0000$$$::According to Saber, this mountain has a barrier that repels Servants.[lr]::
58893::$$$message_0528_0002_0001$$$::If they attempt to approach Ryudou Temple by any other path besides the gate, the barrier hurts them and reduces their magical energy.[lr]::
58894::$$$message_0528_0002_0002$$$::Therefore, the only way into Ryudou Temple is up these stairs.::
58895::$$$message_0528_0003_0000$$$::"I was sure they'd try to ambush us. You don't sense any Servants, Saber?"[lr]::
58896::$$$message_0528_0003_0001$$$::"No.[lr]::
58897::$$$message_0528_0003_0002$$$::I am the only Servant on these steps[line2]"[lr]::
58898::$$$message_0528_0003_0003$$$::Suddenly, Saber halts and looks down.::
58899::$$$message_0528_0004_0000$$$::"Saber...? What happened?"[lr]::
58900::$$$message_0528_0004_0001$$$::"...It must have been my imagination. I thought I saw something that resembles a katana, but there's nothing like that here.[lr]::
58901::$$$message_0528_0004_0002$$$::   The gate is unprotected. Let us go inside."::
58902::$$$message_0528_0005_0000$$$::Saber ascends the stone steps quickly.[lr]::
58903::$$$message_0528_0005_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
58904::$$$message_0528_0005_0002$$$::After a moment's confusion, I run after her.::
58905::$$$message_0528_0006_0000$$$::Inside, it's silent.[lr]::
58906::$$$message_0528_0006_0001$$$::The wind is strong.[lr]::
58907::$$$message_0528_0006_0002$$$::The shadows, deep.[lr]::
58908::$$$message_0528_0006_0003$$$::It's terribly dark, even though the moon is out.::
58909::$$$message_0528_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58910::$$$message_0528_0007_0001$$$::I look up.[lr]::
58911::$$$message_0528_0007_0002$$$::The moon's out, all right.[lr]::
58912::$$$message_0528_0007_0003$$$::It glows brightly, illuminating the unlit temple grounds.[lr]::
58913::$$$message_0528_0007_0004$$$::Despite that, the area is engulfed in shadow.::
58914::$$$message_0528_0008_0000$$$::"Saber."[lr]::
58915::$$$message_0528_0008_0001$$$::"Yes, something is wrong. The lack of response to our entry is inconcievable. And it's too quiet."[lr]::
58916::$$$message_0528_0008_0002$$$::"...Let's look around inside. A family of almost fifty runs Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
58917::$$$message_0528_0008_0003$$$::There's no way it would be this quiet."::
58918::$$$message_0528_0009_0000$$$::I enter the temple with Saber.[lr]::
58919::$$$message_0528_0009_0001$$$::   There's nobody around.[lr]::
58920::$$$message_0528_0009_0002$$$::After making sure the grounds are unoccupied, Saber and I head deeper into the buildings.::
58921::$$$message_0528_0010_0000$$$::   Everybody inside is asleep.[lr]::
58922::$$$message_0528_0010_0001$$$::They show no signs of waking.[lr]::
58923::$$$message_0528_0010_0002$$$::They don't react even when I touch or pick them up.[lr]::
58924::$$$message_0528_0010_0003$$$::Every single one of the fifty or so monks is in a coma.[lr]::
58925::$$$message_0528_0010_0004$$$::All of them lie in a pleasant, dreamlike sleep, breathing steadily.::
58926::$$$message_0528_0011_0000$$$::Of course, one of my classmates is among them.[lr]::
58927::$$$message_0528_0011_0001$$$::Issei Ryudou is asleep. I've only seen him so relaxed on a handful of occasions in the privacy of the student council office.::
58928::$$$message_0528_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58929::$$$message_0528_0012_0001$$$::We move quickly through the wood-floored hallways.[lr]::
58930::$$$message_0528_0012_0002$$$::Saber senses something.[lr]::
58931::$$$message_0528_0012_0003$$$::She directs us towards the inner main shrine.[lr]::
58932::$$$message_0528_0012_0004$$$::The Master behind this disaster must be lurking in the heart of the temple.::
58933::$$$message_0528_0013_0000$$$::We step into the main shrine.[lr]::
58934::$$$message_0528_0013_0001$$$::Suddenly, my eyes are greeted by scarlet blood all over the floor.::
58935::$$$message_0528_0014_0000$$$::"...!?"[lr]::
58936::$$$message_0528_0014_0001$$$::The center of the shrine is drenched in red.[lr]::
58937::$$$message_0528_0014_0002$$$::There's a man on the floor.[lr]::
58938::$$$message_0528_0014_0003$$$::There's a pool of red spreading out from him. Maybe he was stabbed through the chest.::
58939::$$$message_0528_0015_0000$$$::The wound is fatal. He's lost too much blood to survive.[lr]::
58940::$$$message_0528_0015_0001$$$::He's already dead.[lr]::
58941::$$$message_0528_0015_0002$$$::He looks familiar, and he must be the Master of the thing standing besides him.::
58942::$$$message_0528_0016_0000$$$::The Servant stands there, staring down at her Master's lifeless corpse.[lr]::
58943::$$$message_0528_0016_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
58944::$$$message_0528_0016_0002$$$::I'm assailed by a headache and an alarming unease.[lr]::
58945::$$$message_0528_0016_0003$$$::It isn't the gruesome scene that terrifies me, but[line2]::
58946::$$$message_0528_0017_0000$$$::That [font italic=true]thing[font italic=false]...[lr]::
58947::$$$message_0528_0017_0001$$$::That dagger...is something bad.[lr]::
58948::$$$message_0528_0017_0002$$$::Saber doesn't seem to sense it, but somehow, I can tell the power in that dagger is nothing good.::
58949::$$$message_0528_0018_0000$$$::"Caster!"[lr]::
58950::$$$message_0528_0018_0001$$$::Saber stands ready to fight.[lr]::
58951::$$$message_0528_0018_0002$$$::Caster, the purple-robed Servant, doesn't react.[lr]::
58952::$$$message_0528_0018_0003$$$::Is it because we've caught her by surprise, or because she was caught red-handed?[lr]::
58953::$$$message_0528_0018_0004$$$::Saber slightly crouches, ready to attack Caster in a breath.::
58954::$$$message_0528_0019_0000$$$::"No, Saber! Wait!"[lr]::
58955::$$$message_0528_0019_0001$$$::"Why are you stopping me, Shirou!? This is our chance to defeat Caster[line2]"::
58956::$$$message_0528_0020_0000$$$::"Not that, I mean don't touch that dagger! It destroys magecraft. It might sever the contract between Master and Servant!"[lr]::
58957::$$$message_0528_0020_0001$$$::"Then Caster, your Master..."::
58958::$$$message_0528_0021_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
58959::$$$message_0528_0021_0001$$$::We don't know for sure if she killed her Master.[lr]::
58960::$$$message_0528_0021_0002$$$::But it's clear to me that the dagger in her hand has an incomparable ability to dispel magical effects.::
58961::$$$message_0528_0022_0000$$$::"Caster, you would slay your own Master!?"[lr]::
58962::$$$message_0528_0022_0001$$$::Saber advances angrily.[lr]::
58963::$$$message_0528_0022_0002$$$::...Caster turns to look at us.[lr]::
58964::$$$message_0528_0022_0003$$$::Her lifeless demeanor makes her look more wraith than Heroic Spirit.::
58965::$$$message_0528_0023_0000$$$::A sword flashes through the air.[lr]::
58966::$$$message_0528_0023_0001$$$::Saber's sword splits Caster's robe, shredding her clothes as she evades by bounding backwards.::
58967::$$$message_0528_0024_0000$$$::"Sa...ber...?[lr]::
58968::$$$message_0528_0024_0001$$$::You must be here to finish me off. I don't know who put you up to this, but they're thorough."::
58969::$$$message_0528_0025_0000$$$::"Silence. I don't want to hear the words of one who betrays her lord. [lr]::
58970::$$$message_0528_0025_0001$$$::"Ha! You think [font italic=true]I[font italic=false] killed my Master? That I would hurt Souichirou?[lr]::
58971::$$$message_0528_0025_0002$$$::Heh...Haha, hahahahahaha! How amusing. Yes, if I had known this would happen, perhaps I would have done it myself!"::
58972::$$$message_0528_0026_0000$$$::She coughs blood as she laughs.[lr]::
58973::$$$message_0528_0026_0001$$$::The black-clad mage conceals the strange dagger under her robe, and thrusts a hand at Saber.::
58974::$$$message_0528_0027_0000$$$::"You're an eyesore, Saber. Disappear along with your Master."[lr]::
58975::$$$message_0528_0027_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58976::$$$message_0528_0027_0002$$$::There's nothing else to say.[lr]::
58977::$$$message_0528_0027_0003$$$::Watching Caster keenly, Saber swings her sword without hesitation.::
58978::$$$message_0528_0028_0000$$$::...Caster fades away.[lr]::
58979::$$$message_0528_0028_0001$$$::Their clash couldn't even be called a fight.::
58980::$$$message_0528_0029_0000$$$::Caster may have outstanding magecraft, but it was completely ineffective against Saber's high Magic Resistance.[lr]::
58981::$$$message_0528_0029_0001$$$::Saber shrugged off Caster's barrage of spells and cut her down in a single blow.::
58982::$$$message_0528_0030_0000$$$::"I've defeated Caster. Your orders, Master."[lr]::
58983::$$$message_0528_0030_0001$$$::"Uh. R-right. Well, there's nothing else to do here. I could call the hospital...or actually, I should let Kotomine take care of the rest. He should be able to help all the unconscious people."::
58984::$$$message_0528_0031_0000$$$::...But there's no saving the dead man in front of us.[lr]::
58985::$$$message_0528_0031_0001$$$::Caster disappeared, leaving her Master's body behind.[lr]::
58986::$$$message_0528_0031_0002$$$::...His death will be buried in darkness.[lr]::
58987::$$$message_0528_0031_0003$$$::Tonight, he took his last breath, and one day, he will disappear from people's memories, his final fate unknown.::
58988::$$$message_0528_0032_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
58989::$$$message_0528_0032_0001$$$::"...I know. There are four more Masters. I can't afford to freeze up here."[lr]::
58990::$$$message_0528_0032_0002$$$::"That is wise of you to say. I understand how you feel, but please try not to become sentimental."::
58991::$$$message_0528_0033_0000$$$::Saber turns her back on the shrine.[lr]::
58992::$$$message_0528_0033_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58993::$$$message_0528_0033_0002$$$::I'll at least burn the sight of the fallen corpse into my memory before I follow her.::
58994::$$$message_0528_0034_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
58995::$$$message_0528_0034_0001$$$::Wait.[lr]::
58996::$$$message_0528_0034_0002$$$::What was that?::
58997::$$$message_0528_0035_0000$$$::"Shirou? Why did you stop?"[lr]::
58998::$$$message_0528_0035_0001$$$::"Huh? Uh, um, for a second it felt like we were being watched. Didn't you feel it, Saber?"::
58999::$$$message_0528_0036_0000$$$::"I did not sense anything. We have already checked the surroundings for other people. Are you sure you didn't just imagine it?"[lr]::
59000::$$$message_0528_0036_0001$$$::"Ugh...maybe. I bet you're right, Saber. Yeah, it was probably nothing."::
59001::$$$message_0528_0037_0000$$$::"Then let us hurry. Now that Caster has fallen, her victims will begin to wake up. We should leave before we are sighted."::
59002::$$$message_0528_0038_0000$$$::...She's right.[lr]::
59003::$$$message_0528_0038_0001$$$::It leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but this should put an end to the comas happening all over the city.[lr]::
59004::$$$message_0528_0038_0002$$$::I can chalk that up as a win, at least.::
59005::$$$message_0528_0039_0000$$$::"All right. Let's leave the mountain and let Kotomine know. Then we'll go home and rest."[lr]::
59006::$$$message_0528_0039_0001$$$::Saber nods in satisfaction and leaves the shrine.::
59007::$$$message_0528_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59008::$$$message_0528_0040_0001$$$::I ignore the nagging tingling from behind me and follow Saber.[lr]::
59009::$$$message_0528_0040_0002$$$::...All that remains in the shrine are the quiet and the body of the former Master.::
