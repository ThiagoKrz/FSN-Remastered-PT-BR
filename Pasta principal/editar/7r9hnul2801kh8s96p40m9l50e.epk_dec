53359::$$$message_0461_0000_0000$$$::"...ya! Emiya!"[lr]::
53360::$$$message_0461_0000_0001$$$::"Agh..."[lr]::
53361::$$$message_0461_0000_0002$$$::At the voice, I open my eyes.::
53362::$$$message_0461_0000_0003$$$::...My body feels hot. [lr]::
53363::$$$message_0461_0000_0004$$$::The nausea won't go away, my head feels woozy, and I can't even stand up on my own.::
53364::$$$message_0461_0000_0005$$$::"Are you awake? It's okay now! Do you recognize me!?"[lr]::
53365::$$$message_0461_0000_0006$$$::I feel someone slapping my cheeks.::
53366::$$$message_0461_0001_0000$$$::"...Yeah. Only you would slap me at a time like this, Tohsaka."[lr]::
53367::$$$message_0461_0001_0001$$$::"...Thank god. If you can snark, then you must be fine."[lr]::
53368::$$$message_0461_0001_0002$$$::...I wasn't trying to be flippant. It's just how I feel.::
53369::$$$message_0461_0002_0000$$$::"What are you laughing at, stupid? ...Just so you know, I'm not thanking you. Never pull something like that again. If you die, I won't be able to repay my debt."::
53370::$$$message_0461_0003_0000$$$::She shoots me a glare.[lr]::
53371::$$$message_0461_0003_0001$$$::Even so, Tohsaka has one hand supporting my back, while the other is holding my hand as if to check my temperature.::
53372::$$$message_0461_0004_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka? Um, did something weird happen?"[lr]::
53373::$$$message_0461_0004_0001$$$::"You disappeared. You stepped on the shadow, and I thought you fell, but you were just gone. I think it came from over there."::
53374::$$$message_0461_0005_0000$$$::Tohsaka looks to the southern sky[line2]no, the southwest, and grinds her teeth.::
53375::$$$message_0461_0006_0000$$$::"...Oh. But I felt like I was wrapped up in there forever."[lr]::
53376::$$$message_0461_0006_0001$$$::"...Really? It's been less than ten seconds since you jumped into that thing. I'll prove it, look[line2]"::
53377::$$$message_0461_0007_0000$$$::"Shirou!"[lr]::
53378::$$$message_0461_0007_0001$$$::Saber comes running.[lr]::
53379::$$$message_0461_0007_0002$$$::"Why did you attempt such folly again!?"[lr]::
53380::$$$message_0461_0007_0003$$$::Saber supports me on her shoulder, and takes me from Tohsaka.::
53381::$$$message_0461_0008_0000$$$::"Stand away, Master of Archer. If you approach my Master again, I will consider it hostile action."[lr]::
53382::$$$message_0461_0008_0001$$$::"Wait, what? Are we enemies?"::
53383::$$$message_0461_0009_0000$$$::"Of course. You are a Master, and you brought Archer with you.[lr]::
53384::$$$message_0461_0009_0001$$$::I don't know what Shirou's motive was for protecting you, but I cannot allow anyone to so easily approch my Master."::
53385::$$$message_0461_0010_0000$$$::Saber glares at Tohsaka.[lr]::
53386::$$$message_0461_0010_0001$$$::...Oh, no. Come to think of it, I never updated Saber on the situation.::
53387::$$$message_0461_0011_0000$$$::"It's not like that, Saber. Tohsaka and I have a truce right now. Until we defeat Caster, that is."[lr]::
53388::$$$message_0461_0011_0001$$$::"Shirou!? Stop, you must rest!"[lr]::
53389::$$$message_0461_0011_0002$$$::"I said she isn't our enemy. We have a deal."::
53390::$$$message_0461_0012_0000$$$::"...I understand. If you say so, then I won't fight her. So please..."[lr]::
53391::$$$message_0461_0012_0001$$$::"...Yeah, sorry. To be honest, I can't...talk..."::
53392::$$$message_0461_0013_0000$$$::I desperately cling to consciousness as my mind strains under chills and nausea.[lr]::
53393::$$$message_0461_0013_0001$$$::I can pass out once I get home.[lr]::
53394::$$$message_0461_0013_0002$$$::Until then, I need to keep my mind together, at least.::
53395::$$$message_0461_0014_0000$$$::"He survived? Well, he didn't touch the main body. Someone with a physical body might get off with only a fever."[lr]::
53396::$$$message_0461_0014_0001$$$::Archer comes over.[lr]::
53397::$$$message_0461_0014_0002$$$::His expression is neutral, even though he let Zouken escape. He's the calmest one here.::
53398::$$$message_0461_0015_0000$$$::"...Archer. Do you know something about that shadow?"[lr]::
53399::$$$message_0461_0015_0001$$$::"...Not really. But one thing is for certain: that is what's been taking magical energy from people around the city ever since Caster died."::
53400::$$$message_0461_0016_0000$$$::Archer sounds indifferent.[lr]::
53401::$$$message_0461_0016_0001$$$::Then, he directs his attention to me on the ground.::
53402::$$$message_0461_0017_0000$$$::"It appears this is no longer the time to settle personal grievances. Isn't that right, Shirou Emiya?"[lr]::
53403::$$$message_0461_0017_0001$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
53404::$$$message_0461_0017_0002$$$::"Your instincts are correct about what that thing is.[lr]::
53405::$$$message_0461_0017_0003$$$::...Hmph. To think I'd be summoned as a Servant, but end up fighting that."::
53406::$$$message_0461_0018_0000$$$::"Archer...? What are you..."[lr]::
53407::$$$message_0461_0018_0001$$$::Ah, right. You aren't a Guardian yet. You won't have faced its kind before... Good grief. The job never changes, no matter where I go.::
53408::$$$message_0461_0019_0000$$$::The red knight leaves, beckoning Tohsaka to go with him.[lr]::
53409::$$$message_0461_0019_0001$$$::But before he does...::
53410::$$$message_0461_0020_0000$$$::"...Your prospects aren't so grim quite yet.[lr]::
53411::$$$message_0461_0020_0001$$$::   Nothing has happened yet. Will you survive and clean up the aftermath, or nip this in the bud? There are still avenues open to you."[lr]::
53412::$$$message_0461_0020_0002$$$::He murmurs, gazing up at the stars.::
53413::$$$message_0461_0021_0000$$$::...The flickering repeats.[lr]::
53414::$$$message_0461_0021_0001$$$::Fever permeates my body, and I can't feel myself walking.::
53415::$$$message_0461_0022_0000$$$::Someone said something about catching a fever.[lr]::
53416::$$$message_0461_0022_0001$$$::It feels like mosquitoes carrying fever are spreading through my body and swarming around my fingertips.::
53417::$$$message_0461_0023_0000$$$::"S-Senpai!?"::
53418::$$$message_0461_0024_0000$$$::In my daze, I can't distinguish dreams from reality.[lr]::
53419::$$$message_0461_0024_0001$$$::It's like I'm already asleep and trying my damnedest to escape from the dream back to my bedroom.::
53420::$$$message_0461_0025_0000$$$::"Sakura...? Weren't you asleep?"[lr]::
53421::$$$message_0461_0025_0001$$$::"Please move out of the way. The way you're holding him, it'll just be more painful for him."::
53422::$$$message_0461_0026_0000$$$::"No, this is my duty.[lr]::
53423::$$$message_0461_0026_0001$$$::Besides, if he's contracted some disease, it could spread to you."[lr]::
53424::$$$message_0461_0026_0002$$$::"...That's not what I mean.[lr]::
53425::$$$message_0461_0026_0003$$$::Saber, I don't know what you've been doing with Senpai. I know you won't tell me, so I haven't bothered to ask."::
53426::$$$message_0461_0027_0000$$$::"But every day since you arrived, Senpai has looked like he's suffering.[lr]::
53427::$$$message_0461_0027_0001$$$::...If that was all, I would tolerate it. But he came back injured tonight!"[lr]::
53428::$$$message_0461_0027_0002$$$::"Sakura, I[line2]"::
53429::$$$message_0461_0028_0000$$$::"I don't know what your circumstances are. But there has to be a better way than this![lr]::
53430::$$$message_0461_0028_0001$$$::If you can't even manage that, then don't involve him any further!"::
53431::$$$message_0461_0029_0000$$$::...I'm brought back to my room.[lr]::
53432::$$$message_0461_0029_0001$$$::Someone's next to me, putting me to bed, I think.::
53433::$$$message_0461_0030_0000$$$::"..., ..."::
53434::$$$message_0461_0031_0000$$$::I think they whispered into my ear, but I couldn't make it out.[lr]::
53435::$$$message_0461_0031_0001$$$::Did they say they were reckless?[lr]::
53436::$$$message_0461_0031_0002$$$::Did they apologize to me?::
53437::$$$message_0461_0032_0000$$$::Anyway, that's the last thing I heard.[lr]::
53438::$$$message_0461_0032_0001$$$::My consciousness starts to fade as soon as I lie down.[lr]::
53439::$$$message_0461_0032_0002$$$::Everything I see squirms like worms until I pass out.Fÿö«
