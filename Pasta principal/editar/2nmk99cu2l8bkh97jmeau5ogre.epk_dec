54733::$$$message_0486_0000_0000$$$::"Ngah!"[lr]::
54734::$$$message_0486_0000_0001$$$::I throw the knife aside.[lr]::
54735::$$$message_0486_0000_0002$$$::Trying not to look at my wound, I run to Sakura's side.::
54736::$$$message_0486_0001_0000$$$::"Sakura!"[lr]::
54737::$$$message_0486_0001_0001$$$::"Sen...pai..."[lr]::
54738::$$$message_0486_0001_0002$$$::Sakura is sitting on the ground lifelessly, not looking up.::
54739::$$$message_0486_0002_0000$$$::...She's avoiding talking to me.[lr]::
54740::$$$message_0486_0002_0001$$$::I don't know if that's because of Shinji, or if it's because I've been hiding things from her.[lr]::
54741::$$$message_0486_0002_0002$$$::All I know is that Sakura has had a fever since this morning.::
54742::$$$message_0486_0003_0000$$$::"...It's okay. We'll talk later.[lr]::
54743::$$$message_0486_0003_0001$$$::First we'll go home, and then[line2]"[lr]::
54744::$$$message_0486_0003_0002$$$::"!"[lr]::
54745::$$$message_0486_0003_0003$$$::"That's enough. We win, Shinji."::
54746::$$$message_0486_0004_0000$$$::A voice interrupts me.[lr]::
54747::$$$message_0486_0004_0001$$$::I heard Tohsaka from behind. She must have arrived at some point.::
54748::$$$message_0486_0005_0000$$$::Rider is crouched on the floor, wounded by Archer.[lr]::
54749::$$$message_0486_0005_0001$$$::Her clothes are soaked in blood. It doesn't look immediately fatal, but she probably can't fight anymore.::
54750::$$$message_0486_0006_0000$$$::"T-Tohsaka!?[lr]::
54751::$$$message_0486_0006_0001$$$::Emiya, you broke our promise, you coward! I told you to come alone!"::
54752::$$$message_0486_0007_0000$$$::"You did. But that was an order, not a promise, remember? He isn't a coward for defying you."::
54753::$$$message_0486_0008_0000$$$::"T-that's not an excuse! Emiya said he'd come alone, so I expected him to be alone!"::
54754::$$$message_0486_0009_0000$$$::"...Sure, whatever.[lr]::
54755::$$$message_0486_0009_0001$$$::He and I may be here at the same time, but he never asked me for help. I'm here because I want to be."::
54756::$$$message_0486_0010_0000$$$::"Liar! Why would you come if he didn't ask!?[lr]::
54757::$$$message_0486_0010_0001$$$::He just acted all stupidly honest to trick me!"::
54758::$$$message_0486_0011_0000$$$::"Oh, there's an easy explanation for that. When you were on the phone, I was right next to him. You talk really loudly, Matou. I could hear you even though he tried to cover the speaker."::
54759::$$$message_0486_0012_0000$$$::"That good enough for you? I wasn't just going to sit still after you took Sakura. In exchange for luring Emiya out, you've completely made me your enemy."::
54760::$$$message_0486_0013_0000$$$::"You keep talking about Sakura, too.[lr]::
54761::$$$message_0486_0013_0001$$$::Sakura. Sakura, Sakura, Sakura, Sakurasakurasakurasakurasakura![lr]::
54762::$$$message_0486_0013_0002$$$::I can't believe you're just like him! Look at me! I'm a Master now![lr]::
54763::$$$message_0486_0013_0003$$$::You're a Master too, so you should pay attention to me, not Sakura!"::
54764::$$$message_0486_0014_0000$$$::"Oh, really? Then why don't you make your prized Servant fight?[lr]::
54765::$$$message_0486_0014_0001$$$::All Archer did was eviscerate her. Her material cores[line2]her heart and her head aren't destroyed. If you're a competent Master, go ahead and heal your Servant."[lr]::
54766::$$$message_0486_0014_0002$$$::"Ngh! Fine, just watch...!"::
54767::$$$message_0486_0015_0000$$$::Shinji backs away from us and holds out a book.[lr]::
54768::$$$message_0486_0015_0001$$$::"That's..."[lr]::
54769::$$$message_0486_0015_0002$$$::Shinji's Command Spell, the book that burnt to ashes in the park.[lr]::
54770::$$$message_0486_0015_0003$$$::He still had another one!?::
54771::$$$message_0486_0016_0000$$$::"Stand up, Rider! I'm ordering you as your Master to stand up and defeat Archer!"[lr]::
54772::$$$message_0486_0016_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
54773::$$$message_0486_0016_0002$$$::She doesn't answer.[lr]::
54774::$$$message_0486_0016_0003$$$::Rider stays where she is, unmoving.::
54775::$$$message_0486_0017_0000$$$::A crimson pool of blood grows at her feet.[lr]::
54776::$$$message_0486_0017_0001$$$::Right now, it's Rider, not Shinji, who needs help.[lr]::
54777::$$$message_0486_0017_0002$$$::Ordering her to fight would only hasten her demise.::
54778::$$$message_0486_0018_0000$$$::"Damn it! You're my Servant, so fight to the death, you moron!"::
54779::$$$message_0486_0019_0000$$$::Shinji clenches the book tightly.[lr]::
54780::$$$message_0486_0019_0001$$$::As if that's how he uses his Command Spell, Rider's body starts convulsing, trying to stand up.::
54781::$$$message_0486_0020_0000$$$::"Stop it! That's enough, Shinji, just give up! Rider won't last if you keep pushing her!"[lr]::
54782::$$$message_0486_0020_0001$$$::"Ha! These scum all die so easily! Now, I'm taking back Sakura!"::
54783::$$$message_0486_0021_0000$$$::Shinji doesn't rescind his order.[lr]::
54784::$$$message_0486_0021_0001$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
54785::$$$message_0486_0021_0002$$$::I let go of Sakura's hand and start to run at Shinji again.::
54786::$$$message_0486_0022_0000$$$::   But, when I do...[lr]::
54787::$$$message_0486_0022_0001$$$::"No...! No more...!"::
54788::$$$message_0486_0023_0000$$$::"Sakura...?"[lr]::
54789::$$$message_0486_0023_0001$$$::I stop and turn to face her.[lr]::
54790::$$$message_0486_0023_0002$$$::Sakura cries out in anguish,::
54791::$$$message_0486_0024_0000$$$::"Wha!?"[lr]::
54792::$$$message_0486_0024_0001$$$::and Shinji's book bursts into flame, just like it did that night.::
54793::$$$message_0486_0025_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
54794::$$$message_0486_0025_0001$$$::Gusts of wind howl through the corridor.[lr]::
54795::$$$message_0486_0025_0002$$$::They come from Rider, who should have been sprawled on the ground, and Sakura.::
54796::$$$message_0486_0026_0000$$$::"No way. This is Rider...?"[lr]::
54797::$$$message_0486_0026_0001$$$::On edge, Tohsaka and Archer watch their newly arisen foe.[lr]::
54798::$$$message_0486_0026_0002$$$::Rider is completely healed.[lr]::
54799::$$$message_0486_0026_0003$$$::The pressure emanating from her is exactly the same as what I witnessed at Ryudou Temple.::
54800::$$$message_0486_0027_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
54801::$$$message_0486_0027_0001$$$::Suddenly,[lr]::
54802::$$$message_0486_0027_0002$$$::she vanishes into thin air.[lr]::
54803::$$$message_0486_0027_0003$$$::Rider instantly vanishes from my field of view.::
54804::$$$message_0486_0028_0000$$$::"Emiya, get down!"[lr]::
54805::$$$message_0486_0028_0001$$$::"!"[lr]::
54806::$$$message_0486_0028_0002$$$::I duck in response to the warning, and see long hair streak overhead.::
54807::$$$message_0486_0029_0000$$$::"Sakura...!"[lr]::
54808::$$$message_0486_0029_0001$$$::In an instant, Rider leaps away with Sakura in her arms.[lr]::
54809::$$$message_0486_0029_0002$$$::She lands opposite me and Tohsaka, slightly forward of where Shinji is standing.::
54810::$$$message_0486_0030_0000$$$::"Huh...? What are you doing? I ordered you to fight."[lr]::
54811::$$$message_0486_0030_0001$$$::"I am under no such orders. As a Servant, I only protected my Master."::
54812::$$$message_0486_0031_0000$$$::Rider lets Sakura down and glances at Shinji.[lr]::
54813::$$$message_0486_0031_0001$$$::Despite the leather blindfold covering her eyes, her gaze is ice cold.::
54814::$$$message_0486_0032_0000$$$::"D-don't be stupid. I'm your Master. You're supposed to protect me[line2]"[lr]::
54815::$$$message_0486_0032_0001$$$::"Shinji. Command Spells appear on a Master's body. I have never once recognized someone not bearing those stigmata as my Master."::
54816::$$$message_0486_0033_0000$$$::"What...did you say?"[lr]::
54817::$$$message_0486_0033_0001$$$::"You are a fake. I can no longer accompany you, now that you have lost the False Attendant's Writings."::
54818::$$$message_0486_0034_0000$$$::Then, Rider turns her back on Shinji.[lr]::
54819::$$$message_0486_0034_0001$$$::The gesture declares that she will never look at him again.::
54820::$$$message_0486_0035_0000$$$::"Oh. So that's how it was, Rider."[lr]::
54821::$$$message_0486_0035_0001$$$::"You surmise correctly, Master of Archer.[lr]::
54822::$$$message_0486_0035_0002$$$::In fact, you probably deduced it long ago."::
54823::$$$message_0486_0036_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I thought it was strange.[lr]::
54824::$$$message_0486_0036_0001$$$::The Matou family shouldn't be able to produce a Master. Their bloodline has fallen into ruin, failing to produce anyone capable of handling magecraft."::
54825::$$$message_0486_0037_0000$$$::"And there's no way Shinji Matou could ever be a Master. Yet somehow, a Matou Master was chosen, and summoned a Servant."::
54826::$$$message_0486_0038_0000$$$::"...I thought that Zouken summoned you and gave you to Shinji.[lr]::
54827::$$$message_0486_0038_0001$$$::But it was even simpler than that. Zouken didn't need to lift a finger. After all, the person most suited to being a Master in the Matou household right now is..."::
54828::$$$message_0486_0039_0000$$$::Tohsaka isn't looking at Rider.[lr]::
54829::$$$message_0486_0039_0001$$$::Her eyes are directed at...[lr]::
54830::$$$message_0486_0039_0002$$$::"...the legitimate Matou heir.[lr]::
54831::$$$message_0486_0039_0003$$$::Sakura, the mage of the current generation."[lr]::
54832::$$$message_0486_0039_0004$$$::"..."[lr]::
54833::$$$message_0486_0039_0005$$$::...none other than Sakura.::
54834::$$$message_0486_0040_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
54835::$$$message_0486_0040_0001$$$::I can't form any coherent words.[lr]::
54836::$$$message_0486_0040_0002$$$::Tohsaka and Sakura.[lr]::
54837::$$$message_0486_0040_0003$$$::I look back and forth between them both, unable to process anything more than what I just heard.::
54838::$$$message_0486_0041_0000$$$::...My left hand hurts.[lr]::
54839::$$$message_0486_0041_0001$$$::Finally, my mind slows down enough to realize that I'm holding a knife in my left hand by the blade.::
54840::$$$message_0486_0042_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
54841::$$$message_0486_0042_0001$$$::Oh.[lr]::
54842::$$$message_0486_0042_0002$$$::I really am slow.[lr]::
54843::$$$message_0486_0042_0003$$$::Even after hearing Tohsaka's words and seeing the Command Spells on Sakura's right hand, I don't even feel surprised.::
54844::$$$message_0486_0043_0000$$$::All I can think is...why?[lr]::
54845::$$$message_0486_0043_0001$$$::Why is this happening?::
54846::$$$message_0486_0044_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
54847::$$$message_0486_0044_0001$$$::Sakura seems to shrink away, still not raising her face.[lr]::
54848::$$$message_0486_0044_0002$$$::Her body language seems to apologize to me for not telling me sooner.::
54849::$$$message_0486_0045_0000$$$::...Transferring Command Spells. An order to "obey Shinji Matou."[lr]::
54850::$$$message_0486_0045_0001$$$::That's how Rider became Shinji's Servant, while Sakura temporarily gave up her authority as a Master and went back to being a mere mage. When Tohsaka looked at Sakura's hand, she had already transferred her Command Spell to Shinji.::
54851::$$$message_0486_0046_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
54852::$$$message_0486_0046_0001$$$::Sakura bites her lip.::
54853::$$$message_0486_0047_0000$$$::In response,[lr]::
54854::$$$message_0486_0047_0001$$$::"Shit! Do it again, Sakura! Give me control one more time!"[lr]::
54855::$$$message_0486_0047_0002$$$::Shinji runs to her, begging.::
54856::$$$message_0486_0048_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
54857::$$$message_0486_0048_0001$$$::"Hey, why aren't you saying anything!? You don't want to fight, right? You let me be a Master because you didn't want to![lr]::
54858::$$$message_0486_0048_0002$$$::So why are you acting like a good girl all of a sudden!?"::
54859::$$$message_0486_0049_0000$$$::It's like he's tearing off the mask of being her brother.[lr]::
54860::$$$message_0486_0049_0001$$$::His fury pours out like through a broken dam. There's no need to stop it anymore.[lr]::
54861::$$$message_0486_0049_0002$$$::"R-Rider, are you disobeying me?"[lr]::
54862::$$$message_0486_0049_0003$$$::"You are not my Master, Shinji. Even if you are Sakura's brother, if you raise a hand to her, I will simply eliminate you."::
54863::$$$message_0486_0050_0000$$$::Rider lets go of Shinji, who had been clinging to her arm.[lr]::
54864::$$$message_0486_0050_0001$$$::He staggers backwards.::
54865::$$$message_0486_0051_0000$$$::"Ha, haha. Yeah? You'll regret that. No matter what you say, Sakura can just make me a new book.[lr]::
54866::$$$message_0486_0051_0001$$$::You know what'll happen once you're my Servant again[line2]"::
54867::$$$message_0486_0052_0000$$$::"Forget it, Shinji. It's nearly impossible for a human who isn't a mage to handle a Servant. It only happened because she transferred her Command Spell."::
54868::$$$message_0486_0053_0000$$$::"S-sure, you get it. She has one more, though.[lr]::
54869::$$$message_0486_0053_0001$$$::Sakura will do what I say. And then[line2]"::
54870::$$$message_0486_0054_0000$$$::"I said, it's over. Sakura has one seal left. If she uses it up, she won't be able to control Rider anymore.[lr]::
54871::$$$message_0486_0054_0001$$$::Then Rider will be free. A fake spell of authority created from a Command Spell can't restrain a Servant. As soon as you give her an order, the book will burn just like before, and you're done."::
54872::$$$message_0486_0055_0000$$$::"Wha... Then, I..."[lr]::
54873::$$$message_0486_0055_0001$$$::"Yeah. You've lost your chance to be a Master.[lr]::
54874::$$$message_0486_0055_0002$$$::No, you never were one to begin with, since you were controlling her using borrowed Command Spells."::
54875::$$$message_0486_0056_0000$$$::...The cracks spread throughout.[lr]::
54876::$$$message_0486_0056_0001$$$::With a virtually palpable crack, Shinji Matou's very existence crumbles to dust.::
54877::$$$message_0486_0057_0000$$$::"Ha...ha... So it was impossible all along. That's right, I never had any talent for magecraft. Gramps treated me like a failure, and my sister felt sorry for me.[lr]::
54878::$$$message_0486_0057_0001$$$::...Of course. I knew it. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it! I knew all along that I wasn't up for it!"::
54879::$$$message_0486_0058_0000$$$::"Shinji[line2]"[lr]::
54880::$$$message_0486_0058_0001$$$::"It's fine, don't worry, Sakura. This was just for fun. I know I don't have any talent. You're the Matou successor. I can't even crash the party."::
54881::$$$message_0486_0059_0000$$$::"Shinji, you[line2]"[lr]::
54882::$$$message_0486_0059_0001$$$::"Yeah, I know. I get it.[lr]::
54883::$$$message_0486_0059_0002$$$::So, Sakura...you do the rest."::
54884::$$$message_0486_0060_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
54885::$$$message_0486_0060_0001$$$::"I said, you should fight them for me![shock time=400 hmax=30 count=-3] Listen, Emiya and Tohsaka are both our enemies. If you're the Matou heir, you know what to do...!"::
54886::$$$message_0486_0061_0000$$$::"Shinji, you still don't get it?[lr]::
54887::$$$message_0486_0061_0001$$$::Sakura isn't going to fight, and she doesn't care about you. We're not going to bother with you now that you've lost Rider, too. Just hide yourself and behave until the Holy Grail War is over."::
54888::$$$message_0486_0062_0000$$$::"Nobody asked you... Come on, Sakura. You're my cute little sister. You'll do what I say, right?"::
54889::$$$message_0486_0063_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
54890::$$$message_0486_0063_0001$$$::She doesn't answer.[lr]::
54891::$$$message_0486_0063_0002$$$::Sakura clutches one arm to herself and turns away from Shinji,::
54892::$$$message_0486_0063_0003$$$::"...I don't want to. Let's stop this, Shinji."[lr]::
54893::$$$message_0486_0063_0004$$$::and firmly rejects him.::
54894::$$$message_0486_0064_0000$$$::"Sakura. What did you just say?"[lr]::
54895::$$$message_0486_0064_0001$$$::"...I don't want to. You broke your promise. You said you wouldn't kill Senpai, but then you tried to.[lr]::
54896::$$$message_0486_0064_0002$$$::That's enough..."::
54897::$$$message_0486_0065_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
54898::$$$message_0486_0065_0001$$$::Sakura doesn't look at him.[lr]::
54899::$$$message_0486_0065_0002$$$::Shinji stares blank at her, then laughs.::
54900::$$$message_0486_0066_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
54901::$$$message_0486_0066_0001$$$::In that second, I feel an awful chill.[lr]::
54902::$$$message_0486_0066_0002$$$::"Well then. As you wish."[lr]::
54903::$$$message_0486_0066_0003$$$::There's a sound of glass breaking near Sakura.::
54904::$$$message_0486_0067_0000$$$::"Ah! Ngh!"[lr]::
54905::$$$message_0486_0067_0001$$$::Sakura collapses.[lr]::
54906::$$$message_0486_0067_0002$$$::She drops to the ground, the strength gone from her legs.::
54907::$$$message_0486_0068_0000$$$::"Bye, Sakura. If you have to blame someone, blame Grandpa. This was always going to happen, anyway, so you might actually be better off if you let go now!"[lr]::
54908::$$$message_0486_0068_0001$$$::Shinji runs off.::
54909::$$$message_0486_0069_0000$$$::"Ah...Hah, ah!"[lr]::
54910::$$$message_0486_0069_0001$$$::She clutches her hands to her chest, painfully.[lr]::
54911::$$$message_0486_0069_0002$$$::   The earring she was wearing broke, and some liquid drug splashed on her.::
54912::$$$message_0486_0070_0000$$$::"Ah... no...!"[lr]::
54913::$$$message_0486_0070_0001$$$::Sakura trembles on her knees.[lr]::
54914::$$$message_0486_0070_0002$$$::She shudders violently, like a building being shaken by an earthquake, looking like she might fall apart any second.::
54915::$$$message_0486_0071_0000$$$::"Sakura...!"[lr]::
54916::$$$message_0486_0071_0001$$$::I don't know what's happening.[lr]::
54917::$$$message_0486_0071_0002$$$::I just try to run to her side.::
54918::$$$message_0486_0072_0000$$$::"You fool! Don't you know what's happening!?"[lr]::
54919::$$$message_0486_0072_0001$$$::"Ngh."[lr]::
54920::$$$message_0486_0072_0002$$$::I stop.[lr]::
54921::$$$message_0486_0072_0003$$$::At some point, Archer got behind me. He grabs my shoulder.::
54922::$$$message_0486_0073_0000$$$::"Get out of here. If you carelessly feed it, there's no going back."[lr]::
54923::$$$message_0486_0073_0001$$$::He pushes me back and says something odd.::
54924::$$$message_0486_0074_0000$$$::"Feed it? What the hell are you talking[line2]"[lr]::
54925::$$$message_0486_0074_0001$$$::My question is answered before I can finish it.::
54926::$$$message_0486_0075_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
54927::$$$message_0486_0075_0001$$$::The hallway is dyed red.[lr]::
54928::$$$message_0486_0075_0002$$$::The haze hanging over us becomes a mist that wets my skin, covering the walls in what looks like a honey-like sweat.::
54929::$$$message_0486_0076_0000$$$::"Ow, guh!?"[lr]::
54930::$$$message_0486_0076_0001$$$::My skin burns.[lr]::
54931::$$$message_0486_0076_0002$$$::This air...[lr]::
54932::$$$message_0486_0076_0003$$$::This red world is a realm made of magecraft.[lr]::
54933::$$$message_0486_0076_0004$$$::Without a doubt, it's some unknown Bounded Field that will melt everyone in it.::
54934::$$$message_0486_0077_0000$$$::"Tohsaka...this..."[lr]::
54935::$$$message_0486_0077_0001$$$::I can't breathe.[lr]::
54936::$$$message_0486_0077_0002$$$::Or rather, when I try, the mist enters my throat and burns me from the inside.::
54937::$$$message_0486_0078_0000$$$::"...It's the Bounded Field Shinji set up around campus.[lr]::
54938::$$$message_0486_0078_0001$$$::But now it's on a different level, now that Sakura's the Master."[lr]::
54939::$$$message_0486_0078_0002$$$::"Wha..."::
54940::$$$message_0486_0079_0000$$$::I look back.[lr]::
54941::$$$message_0486_0079_0001$$$::At the end of the dark red passage is Sakura on the ground, looking like she's trying to pry something from her chest,[lr]::
54942::$$$message_0486_0079_0002$$$::and Rider, facing us as if to protect Sakura.::
54943::$$$message_0486_0080_0000$$$::"Step aside, Rider. Your master is out of control. We have to stop her before she develops a taste for anyone else's magical energy."[lr]::
54944::$$$message_0486_0080_0001$$$::"I refuse. My duty is to guard my Master. If you're going to kill Sakura, then I cannot let you pass."::
54945::$$$message_0486_0081_0000$$$::"...Oh? So you'll watch her die, instead? Your Master is consuming a remarkable amount of energy. Don't you understand that she's sure to die at this rate?"::
54946::$$$message_0486_0082_0000$$$::"No. She can avoid that fate if she acquires more energy than she loses.[lr]::
54947::$$$message_0486_0082_0001$$$::Fortunately, there are two mages here. Shinji may have fled, but those two cannot escape. I will take your Master before the insects can devour Sakura."::
54948::$$$message_0486_0083_0000$$$::"Hmph! So your nature hasn't changed, even if your Master has.[lr]::
54949::$$$message_0486_0083_0001$$$::You dote on yourself more than the lives of others."[lr]::
54950::$$$message_0486_0083_0002$$$::"That goes for you, as well. You protect your Master before mine."[lr]::
54951::$$$message_0486_0083_0003$$$::"I see. Then there's no need for either of us to hold back!"[wsay canskip=1]::
54952::$$$message_0486_0084_0000$$$::Archer charges.[lr]::
54953::$$$message_0486_0084_0001$$$::Not heeding the stomach-like Bounded Field, the red knight runs at Sakura,[lr]::
54954::$$$message_0486_0084_0002$$$::and clashes with Rider.::
54955::$$$message_0486_0085_0000$$$::"Wait[line2]Tohsaka, are you sure about this? He's fighting Rider now!"[lr]::
54956::$$$message_0486_0085_0001$$$::"...We don't have a choice. You and I won't hold out for much longer. And as a fellow mage, I can't let Sakura fall down this path."::
54957::$$$message_0486_0086_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
54958::$$$message_0486_0086_0001$$$::Fall down what path?[lr]::
54959::$$$message_0486_0086_0002$$$::Is she talking about the Association's laws against abusing magecraft, or Sakura dying because her Magic Circuits are out of control?::
54960::$$$message_0486_0087_0000$$$::"Wait. What do you mean? Why is Sakura[line2]"[lr]::
54961::$$$message_0486_0087_0001$$$::"She's on a rampage. Rider made this Bounded Field, but Sakura's the one activating it. I don't know what Shinji did to her, but she's lashing out indiscriminately."::
54962::$$$message_0486_0088_0000$$$::"...I'm sure Sakura feels the way we do. But she's sucking in magical energy the way a suffocating person craves oxygen... What I'm saying is, I can't let this happen, as Fuyuki's administrator."::
54963::$$$message_0486_0089_0000$$$::"Wha... Can't let what happen? What are you doing to do to her!?"[lr]::
54964::$$$message_0486_0089_0001$$$::"Ask Archer. I only know one way to stop a mage who's become like that. But Archer might know other methods."::
54965::$$$message_0486_0090_0000$$$::"...Either way, we still have to do something about Rider. From what I've seen, Archer is stronger than her, but his output is dropping, somehow."[lr]::
54966::$$$message_0486_0090_0001$$$::"His output is dropping?"::
54967::$$$message_0486_0091_0000$$$::I return my attention to the duel.[lr]::
54968::$$$message_0486_0091_0001$$$::Even I can tell that Archer is overwhelming her.[lr]::
54969::$$$message_0486_0091_0002$$$::Archer was always the stronger Servant, so I'd never expect Rider to put pressure on him.::
54970::$$$message_0486_0092_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
54971::$$$message_0486_0092_0001$$$::And yet...[lr]::
54972::$$$message_0486_0092_0002$$$::...that impression lasts only for a second.::
54973::$$$message_0486_0093_0000$$$::Rider's weapon is her agility.[lr]::
54974::$$$message_0486_0093_0001$$$::So, a defensive battle like the one she's fighting now shouldn't be her forte.[lr]::
54975::$$$message_0486_0093_0002$$$::Rider's greatest strength is her blindingly fast assaults, so she isn't suited to defense.[lr]::
54976::$$$message_0486_0093_0003$$$::It's odd that Archer hasn't already beaten her and reached Sakura.[lr]::
54977::$$$message_0486_0093_0004$$$::Could the fact that this hasn't happened yet mean that Archer's the one on the defensive...?::
54978::$$$message_0486_0094_0000$$$::"Fuh!"[lr]::
54979::$$$message_0486_0094_0001$$$::Archer's sword slices empty air.[lr]::
54980::$$$message_0486_0094_0002$$$::Rider's hair whips to and fro as she evades his swords, simultaneously stepping in to cut Archer.::
54981::$$$message_0486_0095_0000$$$::But she isn't the only one who's mastered simultaneous evasion and offense.[lr]::
54982::$$$message_0486_0095_0001$$$::Archer's right-hand sword parries her dagger, pushing Rider back.::
54983::$$$message_0486_0096_0000$$$::    One step gained, one step lost.[lr]::
54984::$$$message_0486_0096_0001$$$::Their offense and defense are roughly even. The clash of blades continues to echo through the building, with neither fighter able to gain an advantage.::
54985::$$$message_0486_0097_0000$$$::"Kuh..."[lr]::
54986::$$$message_0486_0097_0001$$$::Archer's the one getting desperate, though.[lr]::
54987::$$$message_0486_0097_0002$$$::His energy is steadily getting drained by the Bounded Field while he fails to defeat a weaker opponent.::
54988::$$$message_0486_0098_0000$$$::On top of that, Tohsaka and I are at our breaking point.[lr]::
54989::$$$message_0486_0098_0001$$$::Breathing is hard enough, and I feel my consciousness slipping away the longer I stay in this hallway.[lr]::
54990::$$$message_0486_0098_0002$$$::At this rate, we're going to collapse before Archer can beat Rider.::
54991::$$$message_0486_0099_0000$$$::"Tch."[lr]::
54992::$$$message_0486_0099_0001$$$::Archer clicks his tongue scornfully.[lr]::
54993::$$$message_0486_0099_0002$$$::Then, Rider stops.[lr]::
54994::$$$message_0486_0099_0003$$$::"I've gauged your strength.[lr]::
54995::$$$message_0486_0099_0004$$$::Unfortunately, you cannot defeat me as you are now."[lr]::
54996::$$$message_0486_0099_0005$$$::Rider declares, almost regretfully.::
54997::$$$message_0486_0100_0000$$$::"What...?"[lr]::
54998::$$$message_0486_0100_0001$$$::"I'm saying you cannot win. You cannot use your Noble Phantasm; I don't know if it's because your Master has forbidden it, or if you are holding back out of concern for Sakura's safety.[lr]::
54999::$$$message_0486_0100_0002$$$::However, that spells your defeat. You cannot win against me."::
55000::$$$message_0486_0101_0000$$$::Rider stops her feet, her only weapon, and faces Archer.[lr]::
55001::$$$message_0486_0101_0001$$$::She looks so defenseless, like Archer could finish this match with a single slash.::
55002::$$$message_0486_0102_0000$$$::"...Hmph. I'm not going out of my way for your Master. I just don't need to use it.[lr]::
55003::$$$message_0486_0102_0001$$$::You can't use your Noble Phantasm either. You haven't accumulated enough magical energy to power it, given that Shinji Matou was your Master until moments ago."::
55004::$$$message_0486_0103_0000$$$::"That's true. Shinji did not supply me with any magical energy, so I can't use my Noble Phantasm right now."::
55005::$$$message_0486_0104_0000$$$::"That's right. And I won't bother wasting energy on an opponent who can't use theirs. I simply need to cut both you and the girl down."::
55006::$$$message_0486_0105_0000$$$::"Yes, go ahead and think that, Archer.[lr]::
55007::$$$message_0486_0105_0001$$$::That will also allow me to dispose of you without too much trouble."[lr]::
55008::$$$message_0486_0105_0002$$$::Rider's tone is serene throughout the exchange.::
55009::$$$message_0486_0106_0000$$$::   What is she planning?[lr]::
55010::$$$message_0486_0106_0001$$$::She faces Archer without even taking up a stance with her daggers.[lr]::
55011::$$$message_0486_0106_0002$$$::"Rider, no!"[lr]::
55012::$$$message_0486_0106_0003$$$::I notice a slight movement behind her.::
55013::$$$message_0486_0107_0000$$$::"Sakura. Please hold out a while longer. I will take care of everything."[lr]::
55014::$$$message_0486_0107_0001$$$::"Stop it! That's enough, Rider. I didn't summon you to do...this..."[lr]::
55015::$$$message_0486_0107_0002$$$::"...I cannot comply with that order. Your life takes priority above all else."::
55016::$$$message_0486_0108_0000$$$::Rider raises her arm.[lr]::
55017::$$$message_0486_0108_0001$$$::She's four meters from Archer.[lr]::
55018::$$$message_0486_0108_0002$$$::Maintaining that distance, the Servant raises a hand to her face.[lr]::
55019::$$$message_0486_0108_0003$$$::"Besides...[lr]::
55020::$$$message_0486_0108_0004$$$::This is what you wanted, Sakura."[lr]::
55021::$$$message_0486_0108_0005$$$::She undoes her black restraint.::
55022::$$$message_0486_0109_0000$$$::                                       Suddenly, everything freezes.::
55023::$$$message_0486_0109_0001$$$::Rider's eyes...[lr]::
55024::$$$message_0486_0109_0002$$$::They're inhuman. Even among the rare Mystic Eyes, they're orbits of the highest order.::
55025::$$$message_0486_0109_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55026::$$$message_0486_0109_0004$$$::Ashen eyes.[lr]::
55027::$$$message_0486_0109_0005$$$::Her eyeballs are so different, they could be mistaken for crystals.::
55028::$$$message_0486_0109_0006$$$::Lightless corneas.[lr]::
55029::$$$message_0486_0109_0007$$$::Rectangular pupils connecting to the outside world.[lr]::
55030::$$$message_0486_0109_0008$$$::Her irises freeze, not allowing her eyes to close.[lr]::
55031::$$$message_0486_0109_0009$$$::Hundreds of millions of retinal cells conveying optical information are made of Ether, the Sixth Imaginary Factor.::
55032::$$$message_0486_0109_0010$$$::  Is it a work of art crafted by the gods' affection, or an inborn trait marked by their divine ire?[lr]::
55033::$$$message_0486_0109_0011$$$::Rider's gray eyes are an incomparable aberration, and yet, terribly beautiful.::
55034::$$$message_0486_0109_0012$$$::"...!"[lr]::
55035::$$$message_0486_0109_0013$$$::Archer stiffens.[lr]::
55036::$$$message_0486_0109_0014$$$::Is it because he faced her eyes head-on at that short distance?[lr]::
55037::$$$message_0486_0109_0015$$$::He tries to close his eyes, but his eyelids have already hardened, and he can't move his arms to cover his face.[lr]::
55038::$$$message_0486_0109_0016$$$::He could try to advance and kill Rider, but his legs have already petrified up to his thighs.::
55039::$$$message_0486_0110_0000$$$::"No way. Mystic Eyes of Petrification...!?"[lr]::
55040::$$$message_0486_0110_0001$$$::Tohsaka almost screams in shock.[lr]::
55041::$$$message_0486_0110_0002$$$::...She's next to me, and I don't know what face she's making.[lr]::
55042::$$$message_0486_0110_0003$$$::My own eyes are drawn in by Rider's Mystic Eyes, and I can't look away.[lr]::
55043::$$$message_0486_0110_0004$$$::My blood congeals.[lr]::
55044::$$$message_0486_0110_0005$$$::My bodily fluids solidify, and I lose sensation.::
55045::$$$message_0486_0111_0000$$$::    Mystic Eyes.[lr]::
55046::$$$message_0486_0111_0001$$$::They are single-action magecraft possessed by some mages.::
55047::$$$message_0486_0112_0000$$$::Eyes, organs that normally function as receptors of information from the outside world, are transformed to enact an effect from oneself to the outside world.[lr]::
55048::$$$message_0486_0112_0001$$$::In short, they're items that forcibly cast magecraft on whatever's in their field of vision, and the effects are amplified if the target makes eye contact with the Mystic Eyes.[lr]::
55049::$$$message_0486_0112_0002$$$::That peculiarity makes them feared as things one must never look directly at, since that very act will trap oneself in the user's magecraft.::
55050::$$$message_0486_0113_0000$$$::Because of their concealability and power, Mystic Eyes are viewed among mages as proof of a first-rate practitioner.[lr]::
55051::$$$message_0486_0113_0001$$$::The techniques needed to remake one's eyes into Magic Circuits are worthy of a Magic Crest.::
55052::$$$message_0486_0114_0000$$$::Of course, artificial Mystic Eyes are limited to Charm and Whisper effects.[lr]::
55053::$$$message_0486_0114_0001$$$::Powerful Mystic Eye bearers, are limited to those born with their eyes.::
55054::$$$message_0486_0115_0000$$$::Binding. Compulsion. Contract. Burning. Illusion. Misfortune.[lr]::
55055::$$$message_0486_0115_0001$$$::Mystic Eyes with such power to interfere with others' destinies are termed Noble Colors, and Petrification is one of the highest orders among them.::
55056::$$$message_0486_0116_0000$$$::There are no modern mages who possess such eyes.[lr]::
55057::$$$message_0486_0116_0001$$$::Few mages can even perform Petrification with magecraft.[lr]::
55058::$$$message_0486_0116_0002$$$::Imagine how monumental it is, then, to be able to petrify things by simply seeing them.::
55059::$$$message_0486_0117_0000$$$::Breaker Gorgon: Self-Seal, Dark Temple.[lr]::
55060::$$$message_0486_0117_0001$$$::It takes godly power to seal a divine curse.[lr]::
55061::$$$message_0486_0117_0002$$$::These are demonic eyes, possessed only by Demonic Beasts and holy spirits from the Age of Gods...[lr]::
55062::$$$message_0486_0117_0003$$$::...a magecraft-based Noble Phantasm that is the one and only signature of the Heroic Spirit Medusa, who could turn anyone she saw to stone!::
55063::$$$message_0486_0118_0000$$$::"Ngh! Get back, Rin! The worst is yet to come...!"[lr]::
55064::$$$message_0486_0118_0001$$$::Petrified up to his hips, Archer shouts a warning.[lr]::
55065::$$$message_0486_0118_0002$$$::Across from him,[lr]::
55066::$$$message_0486_0118_0003$$$::behind Rider with her unleashed Mystic Eyes, some dark red wave begins to spread.::
55067::$$$message_0486_0119_0000$$$::"You...say that...but...!"[lr]::
55068::$$$message_0486_0119_0001$$$::Tohsaka moves sluggishly.[lr]::
55069::$$$message_0486_0119_0002$$$::Something bad flows down the hallway toward us.[lr]::
55070::$$$message_0486_0119_0003$$$::The wave narrows like a spear and makes a beeline for Tohsaka.::
55071::$$$message_0486_0120_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55072::$$$message_0486_0120_0001$$$::She's going to die.[lr]::
55073::$$$message_0486_0120_0002$$$::Tohsaka can't take a single step. Maybe she's been enchanted by the Mystic Eyes even worse than I am.[lr]::
55074::$$$message_0486_0120_0003$$$::That spear is going to pierce her through the chest, and she can't do a thing about it.[lr]::
55075::$$$message_0486_0120_0004$$$::Her fate a few seconds from now flashes before my eyes, so...[lr]::
