77591::$$$message_0721_0000_0000$$$::"We'll patrol Miyama tonight. It's been weird around here lately, so we should make sure our home turf is secure."[lr]::
77592::$$$message_0721_0000_0001$$$::"I agree. Although the naked eye cannot detect everything, we should glean some valuable information if we are thorough in our search."::
77593::$$$message_0721_0001_0000$$$::...Let's check out the nearby neighborhoods first.[lr]::
77594::$$$message_0721_0001_0001$$$::We head down to the intersection and patrol the European-style neighborhoods.[lr]::
77595::$$$message_0721_0001_0002$$$::If we don't find anything, then we can just move on to Shinto and look for clues there.::
77596::$$$message_0721_0002_0000$$$::After doing a circuit of the neighborhoods, we return to the intersection.[lr]::
77597::$$$message_0721_0002_0001$$$::There was nothing out of the ordinary in our area.[lr]::
77598::$$$message_0721_0002_0002$$$::All that's left is to search the hill on the European side, and we can go as far as Ryudou Temple if we want to expand our search area...::
77599::$$$message_0721_0003_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
77600::$$$message_0721_0003_0001$$$::A sudden chill runs up my spine.[lr]::
77601::$$$message_0721_0003_0002$$$::"Saber, that's...!?"[lr]::
77602::$$$message_0721_0003_0003$$$::Saber looks in the direction of Shinto. She must have better senses than me.::
77603::$$$message_0721_0004_0000$$$::...Whatever I sensed is fading.[lr]::
77604::$$$message_0721_0004_0001$$$::But it was unmistakably a scream accompanied by a strong wave of magical energy.[lr]::
77605::$$$message_0721_0004_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77606::$$$message_0721_0004_0003$$$::I knew it.[lr]::
77607::$$$message_0721_0004_0004$$$::It's the entire reason we're looking around outside.[lr]::
77608::$$$message_0721_0004_0005$$$::But why won't my brain work?::
77609::$$$message_0721_0005_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
77610::$$$message_0721_0005_0001$$$::I told myself I was ready to fight.[lr]::
77611::$$$message_0721_0005_0002$$$::Any hesitation disappeared the moment I risked my life.[lr]::
77612::$$$message_0721_0005_0003$$$::But now, my body won't listen to my brain.::
77613::$$$message_0721_0006_0000$$$::...It's too soon.[lr]::
77614::$$$message_0721_0006_0001$$$::I never expected that we'd hit the mark on the first day.[lr]::
77615::$$$message_0721_0006_0002$$$::So I can't move. I may be used to being attacked, but I'm not used to going on the attack.[lr]::
77616::$$$message_0721_0006_0003$$$::I'm such an idiot.[lr]::
77617::$$$message_0721_0006_0004$$$::I kept saying I was ready to die, but I never thought about killing anyone else...::
77618::$$$message_0721_0007_0000$$$::"The scream stopped. The presence we sensed is fading. I don't know what just happened, but I doubt we'll be able to help whoever was attacked."::
77619::$$$message_0721_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77620::$$$message_0721_0008_0001$$$::Then, it passes.[lr]::
77621::$$$message_0721_0008_0002$$$::My frozen brain and paralyzed limbs move again.[lr]::
77622::$$$message_0721_0008_0003$$$::The fear of watching someone die drives away[lr]::
77623::$$$message_0721_0008_0004$$$::the fear of an imminent battle of life and death.::
77624::$$$message_0721_0009_0000$$$::"I'm sorry, Saber...!"[lr]::
77625::$$$message_0721_0009_0001$$$::I break into a sprint, apologizing for my own spinelessness.[lr]::
77626::$$$message_0721_0009_0002$$$::I dash towards the source of the scream, and the battle that left such ominous magical energy.[lr]::
77627::$$$message_0721_0009_0003$$$::I'm not ready.[lr]::
77628::$$$message_0721_0009_0004$$$::My legs are shaking even as I run.[lr]::
77629::$$$message_0721_0009_0005$$$::    That's the correct response.[lr]::
77630::$$$message_0721_0009_0006$$$::If I lack the will to fight, to want the Holy Grail for myself, then that fear will inevitably come for me.::
77631::$$$message_0721_0010_0000$$$::"...What the hell are you doing, you dumbass!?"[lr]::
77632::$$$message_0721_0010_0001$$$::That's right.[lr]::
77633::$$$message_0721_0010_0002$$$::If I had a reason to fight, then I should have embraced it first.[lr]::
77634::$$$message_0721_0010_0003$$$::If Shirou Emiya is facing those armed with wishes for the Holy Grail...[lr]::
77635::$$$message_0721_0010_0004$$$::...then he needs to confront and erase this fear with the wish to stop the fighting!::
