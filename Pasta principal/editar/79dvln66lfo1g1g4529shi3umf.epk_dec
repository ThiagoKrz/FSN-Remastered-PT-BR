40704::$$$message_0354_0000_0000$$$::I run down the stairs.[lr]::
40705::$$$message_0354_0000_0001$$$::The fierce sword fight is happening close by.::
40706::$$$message_0354_0001_0000$$$::"All right. This place connects to the hall's atrium."[lr]::
40707::$$$message_0354_0001_0001$$$::Tohsaka checks the end of the passage.[lr]::
40708::$$$message_0354_0001_0002$$$::The hallway splits at a T-junction and both seem to lead to the terrace at either side of the hall.::
40709::$$$message_0354_0002_0000$$$::"Let's split up here. I'll go from this side, so you go from that side."::
40710::$$$message_0354_0003_0000$$$::It's better to split up than to stay together in one place.[lr]::
40711::$$$message_0354_0003_0001$$$::...With the way we are now, we don't have any way to escape if we are found.[lr]::
40712::$$$message_0354_0003_0002$$$::We don't stand a chance either way.[lr]::
40713::$$$message_0354_0003_0003$$$::So we'll split up.[lr]::
40714::$$$message_0354_0003_0004$$$::If we split up, even if one was found, there's hope that the other can manage to escape somehow.::
40715::$$$message_0354_0004_0000$$$::Tohsaka goes down the hallway facing east.[lr]::
40716::$$$message_0354_0004_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40717::$$$message_0354_0004_0002$$$::I nod, and go down the other hallway... The other hallway on the other side facing west.::
40718::$$$message_0354_0005_0000$$$::"...Shirou."[lr]::
40719::$$$message_0354_0005_0001$$$::She suddenly stops me.::
40720::$$$message_0354_0006_0000$$$::"...You know, right? Whatever happens, don't do anything. We don't have the option to fight right now.[lr]::
40721::$$$message_0354_0006_0001$$$::Run away as soon as you think it's dangerous, okay? Run away even if one of us gets caught... Saving others comes after you save yourself."::
40722::$$$message_0354_0007_0000$$$::Her voice is suppressing her emotions.[lr]::
40723::$$$message_0354_0007_0001$$$::That sounded more like a plea than a warning.::
40724::$$$message_0354_0008_0000$$$::I go around and come out onto the terrace of the lobby.[lr]::
40725::$$$message_0354_0008_0001$$$::I see Tohsaka emerge from the opposite side on the terrace far away.::
40726::$$$message_0354_0009_0000$$$::She immediately takes cover and peeks out to see what's going on while hiding.[lr]::
40727::$$$message_0354_0009_0001$$$::The instant we looked down at the hall, we both suppress our voices.::
40728::$$$message_0354_0010_0000$$$::"S-Shinji...!? Why is he here...!?"::
40729::$$$message_0354_0011_0000$$$::Shinji stands atop the rubble in the corner of the lobby, observing the spectacle with joy.::
40730::$$$message_0354_0012_0000$$$::No, that's not it.[lr]::
40731::$$$message_0354_0012_0001$$$::That's not the surprising thing.[lr]::
40732::$$$message_0354_0012_0002$$$::Right now, the truth that I have to accept right now is the battle that Shinji is observing.::
40733::$$$message_0354_0013_0000$$$::"[wacky len=12]"[lr]::
40734::$$$message_0354_0013_0001$$$::The black giant lets out a roar.[lr]::
40735::$$$message_0354_0013_0002$$$::The swinging axe-sword stirs up a cloud of dust and crushes the rubble into powder.[lr]::
40736::$$$message_0354_0013_0003$$$::Berserker is no different than before.[lr]::
40737::$$$message_0354_0013_0004$$$::No, his bloodcurdling roar doesn't compare to what it sounded like before.::
40738::$$$message_0354_0014_0000$$$::Behind the giant is the pale white girl.[lr]::
40739::$$$message_0354_0014_0001$$$::Berserker's Master, Illyasviel.[lr]::
40740::$$$message_0354_0014_0002$$$::That girl that was always smiling innocently and unfit for a kill fest...[lr]::
40741::$$$message_0354_0014_0003$$$::That girl...[lr]::
40742::$$$message_0354_0014_0004$$$::...is now shivering and staring at her own Servant about to cry out.::
40743::$$$message_0354_0015_0000$$$::Her pale face is desperately trying to deny the despair in front of her.[lr]::
40744::$$$message_0354_0015_0001$$$::"Someone help me."[lr]::
40745::$$$message_0354_0015_0002$$$::That's what the trembling lips of the snow white girl seem to say.::
40746::$$$message_0354_0016_0000$$$::"...No..."::
40747::$$$message_0354_0017_0000$$$::A whirlwind blows violently.[lr]::
40748::$$$message_0354_0017_0001$$$::Berserker's axe-sword is repelled each time.[lr]::
40749::$$$message_0354_0017_0002$$$::In the center of the hall...[lr]::
40750::$$$message_0354_0017_0003$$$::By the Noble Phantasm of one Servant reigning the throne of rubble.::
40751::$$$message_0354_0018_0000$$$::The countless numbers of swords dance.[lr]::
40752::$$$message_0354_0018_0001$$$::Each one of the weapons appearing behind the man is undeniably a fatal weapon.::
40753::$$$message_0354_0019_0000$$$::"[wacky len=9]...!"[lr]::
40754::$$$message_0354_0019_0001$$$::They pierce through.[lr]::
40755::$$$message_0354_0019_0002$$$::Like hot water.[lr]::
40756::$$$message_0354_0019_0003$$$::The bottomless Noble Phantasm destroys Berserker's body, as if repelling his axe-sword wasn't already enough.::
40757::$$$message_0354_0020_0000$$$::His limbs fly off.[lr]::
40758::$$$message_0354_0020_0001$$$::The swords cut through his body, penetrate his head, and pierce his heart.::
40759::$$$message_0354_0021_0000$$$::   But, he still does not die.[lr]::
40760::$$$message_0354_0021_0001$$$::The giant revives after each instantaneous death that he suffers and resolutely advances towards his enemy.[lr]::
40761::$$$message_0354_0021_0002$$$::Eight times already.[lr]::
40762::$$$message_0354_0021_0003$$$::Berserker moves forward, while being killed mercilessly that many times.[lr]::
40763::$$$message_0354_0021_0004$$$::That enemy welcomes him with a smile.::
40764::$$$message_0354_0022_0000$$$::The repeated tragedy.[lr]::
40765::$$$message_0354_0022_0001$$$::Berserker is killed many times, unable to get close to his enemy.::
40766::$$$message_0354_0023_0000$$$::"...No... Way..."::
40767::$$$message_0354_0024_0000$$$::It's not because Berserker is being defeated without being able to do anything.[lr]::
40768::$$$message_0354_0024_0001$$$::That man... That Servant is beyond belief.::
40769::$$$message_0354_0025_0000$$$::All the Noble Phantasms that are repeated infinitely are real.[lr]::
40770::$$$message_0354_0025_0001$$$::I can tell since I have Projected Archer's swords.[lr]::
40771::$$$message_0354_0025_0002$$$::Those are the original versions of every Noble Phantasm, the ones from before they became legends.[lr]::
40772::$$$message_0354_0025_0003$$$::Who could he be, being a Heroic Spirit who's able to retain so many weapons?[lr]::
40773::$$$message_0354_0025_0004$$$::No, first of all, there should be seven Servants.[lr]::
40774::$$$message_0354_0025_0005$$$::Then he's the eighth one... Is he the one who shouldn't exist...?::
40775::$$$message_0354_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40776::$$$message_0354_0026_0001$$$::I can't breathe.[lr]::
40777::$$$message_0354_0026_0002$$$::Berserker is nothing less than astounding.[lr]::
40778::$$$message_0354_0026_0003$$$::A body made out of steel and that superhuman strength. On top of that, he can regenerate on the spot even if he dies. He's not an opponent that can be matched.[lr]::
40779::$$$message_0354_0026_0004$$$::The eighth Servant doesn't retreat from such a monstrous opponent and overwhelms Berserker with the repeated magic swords and holy swords.::
40780::$$$message_0354_0027_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40781::$$$message_0354_0027_0001$$$::When I look up, Tohsaka's face on the other side was also pale.[lr]::
40782::$$$message_0354_0027_0002$$$::   It's only natural.[lr]::
40783::$$$message_0354_0027_0003$$$::The space below us is a land of death.[lr]::
40784::$$$message_0354_0027_0004$$$::We'll die instantly if we enter it.[lr]::
40785::$$$message_0354_0027_0005$$$::No, more than that...::
40786::$$$message_0354_0028_0000$$$::...He is a demon.[lr]::
40787::$$$message_0354_0028_0001$$$::A different atrocity than Berserker... This man lacks order and wishes for battles only for the objective of killing.::
40788::$$$message_0354_0029_0000$$$::    But...[lr]::
40789::$$$message_0354_0029_0001$$$::Even with such an unusual enemy in front of him, the black giant is still the strongest.[lr]::
40790::$$$message_0354_0029_0002$$$::His steps don't cease, even if his whole body is pierced or cut up.[lr]::
40791::$$$message_0354_0029_0003$$$::He receives the rain of Noble Phantasms, regenerates each time, and surely closes in on his enemy.::
40792::$$$message_0354_0030_0000$$$::It is an advance devoid of tactics.[lr]::
40793::$$$message_0354_0030_0001$$$::He is not thinking of any ways of countering his enemy's attacks.[lr]::
40794::$$$message_0354_0030_0002$$$::He moves forward as long as he is alive. It is a savage battle about just killing the enemy.::
40795::$$$message_0354_0031_0000$$$::"[wacky len=12]"[lr]::
40796::$$$message_0354_0031_0001$$$::...He will not reach the enemy.[lr]::
40797::$$$message_0354_0031_0002$$$::Berserker's brute courage will prove futile, and his life will end just as a mere target.[lr]::
40798::$$$message_0354_0031_0003$$$::That enemy understands that.[lr]::
40799::$$$message_0354_0031_0004$$$::That's why he stopped on purpose and is just provoking the giant that foolishly moves forward.::
40800::$$$message_0354_0032_0000$$$::"[wacky len=12]"[lr]::
40801::$$$message_0354_0032_0001$$$::There is no chance of victory for the black giant with this method.[lr]::
40802::$$$message_0354_0032_0002$$$::It's something that the man confronting him and I, looking as an outsider, can tell.[lr]::
40803::$$$message_0354_0032_0003$$$::   And, most likely...[lr]::
40804::$$$message_0354_0032_0004$$$::Even Berserker himself, who is being used for target practice, must have realized the same thing a while back.::
40805::$$$message_0354_0033_0000$$$::"[wacky len=12]"[lr]::
40806::$$$message_0354_0033_0001$$$::Yet, the giant keeps stupidly moving forward.[lr]::
40807::$$$message_0354_0033_0002$$$::He knows no retreat and doesn't try to avoid the attacks.[lr]::
40808::$$$message_0354_0033_0003$$$::That man welcomes the figure with a smile.::
40809::$$$message_0354_0034_0000$$$::"...Heh. All you can do is attack. Guess it shouldn't surprise me since you're Berserker. Still, I had hopes for you as a fellow demigod, but I didn't expect you to be such a fool!"[lr]::
40810::$$$message_0354_0034_0001$$$::The Noble Phantasms appear.[lr]::
40811::$$$message_0354_0034_0002$$$::Roaring with laughter, the man commands the Noble Phantasms behind him.::
40812::$$$message_0354_0035_0000$$$::"Then, I shall finish you off. It would be unpleasant for you to come any closer."[lr]::
40813::$$$message_0354_0035_0001$$$::   At his signal, the numerous Noble Phantasms attack the giant. [lr]::
40814::$$$message_0354_0035_0002$$$::The giant repels a majority of them, and at the same time, a majority of them take his life.::
40815::$$$message_0354_0036_0000$$$::"[wacky len=12]"[lr]::
40816::$$$message_0354_0036_0001$$$::The black giant shakes.[lr]::
40817::$$$message_0354_0036_0002$$$::The body of rock starts to fall.[lr]::
40818::$$$message_0354_0036_0003$$$::   But...[lr]::
40819::$$$message_0354_0036_0004$$$::The giant holds out and shakes off the Noble Phantasms clinging all over his body.::
40820::$$$message_0354_0037_0000$$$::"What... The...?"[lr]::
40821::$$$message_0354_0037_0001$$$::The astonishment comes from that man.[lr]::
40822::$$$message_0354_0037_0002$$$::The black giant gets rid of the swarm of Noble Phantasms and closes in on his enemy. [lr]::
40823::$$$message_0354_0037_0003$$$::...His body is already a corpse.[lr]::
40824::$$$message_0354_0037_0004$$$::The black giant advances with what should be a hopelessly fatal wound.::
40825::$$$message_0354_0038_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40826::$$$message_0354_0038_0001$$$::...That is the result of a strong will.[lr]::
40827::$$$message_0354_0038_0002$$$::It is not the madness due to being Berserker.[lr]::
40828::$$$message_0354_0038_0003$$$::The giant is facing this hopeless battle with a strong will.::
40829::$$$message_0354_0039_0000$$$::"Ugh... That stupid target that's only got its size going for it is still intact...!?"[lr]::
40830::$$$message_0354_0039_0001$$$::The magic bullets are fired mercilessly.[lr]::
40831::$$$message_0354_0039_0002$$$::"[wacky len=12]"[lr]::
40832::$$$message_0354_0039_0003$$$::Repelling them with his axe-sword, the giant closes in on the man with his body slashed and his legs pierced.::
40833::$$$message_0354_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40834::$$$message_0354_0040_0001$$$::He most likely won't reach the man.[lr]::
40835::$$$message_0354_0040_0002$$$::Yet for him to still challenge himself while understanding that, he must have something that he cannot give up.::
40836::$$$message_0354_0041_0000$$$::   What is he moving forward for?[lr]::
40837::$$$message_0354_0041_0001$$$::The Servant fights for his Master, to protect her life.[lr]::
40838::$$$message_0354_0041_0002$$$::That is why that giant did not retreat.[lr]::
40839::$$$message_0354_0041_0003$$$::He could only move forward as a shield to protect his Master behind him, the frightened girl, from the rain of Noble Phantasms.[lr]::
40840::$$$message_0354_0041_0004$$$::The giant resumes his foolish advancement.[lr]::
40841::$$$message_0354_0041_0005$$$::It is because he knew that he could only defeat that enemy while protecting Illyasviel by taking all the attacks himself.::
40842::$$$message_0354_0042_0000$$$::And... If he is able to reach his enemy, then that is when he wins.[lr]::
40843::$$$message_0354_0042_0001$$$::It was this kind of battle from the start.[lr]::
40844::$$$message_0354_0042_0002$$$::The man has to kill the black giant before he reaches him,[lr]::
40845::$$$message_0354_0042_0003$$$::and the giant has to approach the man before his life ends.[lr]::
40846::$$$message_0354_0042_0004$$$::This is a battle where whoever accomplishes their own goal first survives.::
40847::$$$message_0354_0043_0000$$$::The giant is aware of that.[lr]::
40848::$$$message_0354_0043_0001$$$::...Even if that is...[lr]::
40849::$$$message_0354_0043_0002$$$::A battle that he had no chance of winning from the start.::
40850::$$$message_0354_0044_0000$$$::"[wacky len=9]...!"[lr]::
40851::$$$message_0354_0044_0001$$$::He lets out a roar.[lr]::
40852::$$$message_0354_0044_0002$$$::Coming out of his tenth death, the black giant runs.[lr]::
40853::$$$message_0354_0044_0003$$$::He charges towards the man, stirring up rubble, like a bull challenging a matador.::
40854::$$$message_0354_0045_0000$$$::"You servant...!"[lr]::
40855::$$$message_0354_0045_0001$$$::Numerous arrows are released.[lr]::
40856::$$$message_0354_0045_0002$$$::Did he get used to it from the repeated deaths or was it his final charge?[lr]::
40857::$$$message_0354_0045_0003$$$::The giant repels all the arrows,[lr]::
40858::$$$message_0354_0045_0004$$$::and closes in on the owner of the Noble Phantasms...!::
40859::$$$message_0354_0046_0000$$$::The axe-sword is swung.[lr]::
40860::$$$message_0354_0046_0001$$$::The strong sword that had not been swung at the man at all zips through the air with a flash...[lr]::
40861::$$$message_0354_0046_0002$$$::"...Chain of the Heavens...!"[lr]::
40862::$$$message_0354_0046_0003$$$::The black bull is captured by the numerous chains that appear.::
40863::$$$message_0354_0047_0000$$$::What kind of Noble Phantasm is it?[lr]::
40864::$$$message_0354_0047_0001$$$::The chains that suddenly appeared in midair lock up Berserker as if binding space itself.::
40865::$$$message_0354_0048_0000$$$::"[wacky len=12]"[lr]::
40866::$$$message_0354_0048_0001$$$::The chains tighten Berserker's arms and twist them in every direction.[lr]::
40867::$$$message_0354_0048_0002$$$::As the chains wrap around his whole body, they continuously get tighter and even try to squeeze his rock-like neck off with tension.::
40868::$$$message_0354_0049_0000$$$::"...Geez, you still won't die?[lr]::
40869::$$$message_0354_0049_0001$$$::These chains once bound the Bull of Heaven, but even they do not seem to be enough to finish you off."::
40870::$$$message_0354_0050_0000$$$::The man's voice.[lr]::
40871::$$$message_0354_0050_0001$$$::The hall is filled with the creaking sounds of the chains.[lr]::
40872::$$$message_0354_0050_0002$$$::It must be Berserker's strength.[lr]::
40873::$$$message_0354_0050_0003$$$::The giant tries to cut off the chains that control space itself.[lr]::
40874::$$$message_0354_0050_0004$$$::Even if it initially sounds impossible, there's no doubt that giant can accomplish it.[lr]::
40875::$$$message_0354_0050_0005$$$::And of course, the man understood that as well.::
40876::$$$message_0354_0051_0000$$$::"No... Come back, Berserker...!"[lr]::
40877::$$$message_0354_0051_0001$$$::The girl screams.[lr]::
40878::$$$message_0354_0051_0002$$$::Illyasviel uses a Command Spell to command Berserker to retreat by force.[lr]::
40879::$$$message_0354_0051_0003$$$::But, the giant is still captured by the chains and unable to move an inch.::
40880::$$$message_0354_0052_0000$$$::"Why...? I told you to come back inside me, so why...?"[lr]::
40881::$$$message_0354_0052_0001$$$::"It's useless, you puppet. Not even the gods can escape these chains. No, the higher the divinity, the more they become prey. This was originally made just to discipline the gods. I will not allow teleportation through a Command Spell."::
40882::$$$message_0354_0053_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
40883::$$$message_0354_0053_0001$$$::The man points to the giant, as if to signal the end.[lr]::
40884::$$$message_0354_0053_0002$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
40885::$$$message_0354_0053_0003$$$::An astonished girl's voice.::
40886::$$$message_0354_0054_0000$$$::...It's over.[lr]::
40887::$$$message_0354_0054_0001$$$::This time, it really ends.::
40888::$$$message_0354_0055_0000$$$::Bounded by chains and therefore unable to defend himself, he gets annihilated by the Noble Phantasm twenty-two times.[lr]::
40889::$$$message_0354_0055_0001$$$::The black giant goes silent as he is forced to assume the shape of what can only be described as a strange statue.::
40890::$$$message_0354_0056_0000$$$::...There's no need to even check whether he's breathing or not.[lr]::
40891::$$$message_0354_0056_0001$$$::Even if he is a great hero that overcame ten deaths, he should not be able to get back up after experiencing over twenty deaths.[lr]::
40892::$$$message_0354_0056_0002$$$::...Yes.[lr]::
40893::$$$message_0354_0056_0003$$$::Even if he is alive, the giant should not have enough strength to even breathe.::
40894::$$$message_0354_0057_0000$$$::   And the battle ends.[lr]::
40895::$$$message_0354_0057_0001$$$::It was known from the start who was going to win.[lr]::
40896::$$$message_0354_0057_0002$$$::...Berserker could not win against that Servant.::
40897::$$$message_0354_0058_0000$$$::No Servant can be a match for that man as long as they are a Heroic Spirit. Heroic Spirits each have their own weaknesses, which have been preserved from their time as living beings.[lr]::
40898::$$$message_0354_0058_0001$$$::By extension, each Servant's origin story is their weakest point.[lr]::
40899::$$$message_0354_0058_0002$$$::Then... What would be the result of having a Heroic Spirit face off against someone who possesses all the Noble Phantasms, including the one that ended their life as a human?::
40900::$$$message_0354_0059_0000$$$::This is the result.[lr]::
40901::$$$message_0354_0059_0001$$$::Even if he may have been stronger as a hero, he cannot win against that man as long as he's a Heroic Spirit...::
40902::$$$message_0354_0060_0000$$$::"No... No, Berserker...!"[lr]::
40903::$$$message_0354_0060_0001$$$::The ghostly white girl runs to the black giant that became a corpse.[lr]::
40904::$$$message_0354_0060_0002$$$::And...[lr]::
40905::$$$message_0354_0060_0003$$$::The man mercilessly slashes the girl with the sword in his hand.::
40906::$$$message_0354_0061_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
40907::$$$message_0354_0061_0001$$$::She screams.[lr]::
40908::$$$message_0354_0061_0002$$$::The man takes takes away the girl's vision with a single horizontal strike.::
40909::$$$message_0354_0062_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
40910::$$$message_0354_0062_0001$$$::For the next attack, the aim is to stab her heart.[lr]::
40911::$$$message_0354_0062_0002$$$::But that misses.[lr]::
40912::$$$message_0354_0062_0003$$$::No, he missed on purpose.[lr]::
40913::$$$message_0354_0062_0004$$$::The girl is pierced in the lung, and she coughs up blood.::
40914::$$$message_0354_0063_0000$$$::    The chains are broken.[lr]::
40915::$$$message_0354_0063_0001$$$::"[wacky len=9]...!!!!"[lr]::
40916::$$$message_0354_0063_0002$$$::The black giant breaks the chains and launches an attack on the man.[lr]::
40917::$$$message_0354_0063_0003$$$::The man stabs the slow-witted target.::
40918::$$$message_0354_0064_0000$$$::The spear pierces his heart.[lr]::
40919::$$$message_0354_0064_0001$$$::He finishes off the giant with a spear similar to Lancer's Noble Phantasm, GÃ¡e Bolg.[lr]::
40920::$$$message_0354_0064_0002$$$::    Then it ends.[lr]::
40921::$$$message_0354_0064_0003$$$::The black giant dies for sure this time.::
40922::$$$message_0354_0065_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
40923::$$$message_0354_0065_0001$$$::The sword is pulled out from the collapsed girl.[lr]::
40924::$$$message_0354_0065_0002$$$::Leaving traces of red behind, the girl crawls to the giant that is no longer moving.::
40925::$$$message_0354_0066_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
40926::$$$message_0354_0066_0001$$$::Watching in delight, the man walks forward.[lr]::
40927::$$$message_0354_0066_0002$$$::He threw away his sword.[lr]::
40928::$$$message_0354_0066_0003$$$::He will use his bare hands...[lr]::
40929::$$$message_0354_0066_0004$$$::...To finish off the dying girl.::
40930::$$$message_0354_0067_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
40931::$$$message_0354_0067_0001$$$::I'll die.[lr]::
40932::$$$message_0354_0067_0002$$$::I'll probably die.[lr]::
40933::$$$message_0354_0067_0003$$$::I'll die for sure this time.[lr]::
40934::$$$message_0354_0067_0004$$$::That Servant has no logic.[lr]::
40935::$$$message_0354_0067_0005$$$::He will kill anyone in his way.[lr]::
40936::$$$message_0354_0067_0006$$$::If I don't get away from here before he finds me, I'll surely be killed.[lr]::
40937::$$$message_0354_0067_0007$$$::So I...ùÓzŠ
