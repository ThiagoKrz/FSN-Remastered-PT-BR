72618::$$$message_0666_0000_0000$$$::...I hear a sound.[lr]::
72619::$$$message_0666_0000_0001$$$::Slight tremors shake the cave.[lr]::
72620::$$$message_0666_0000_0002$$$::I can only barely hear the light and sound from afar, but the cave is creaking and shaking.::
72621::$$$message_0666_0001_0000$$$::Is that thunder in the distance?[lr]::
72622::$$$message_0666_0001_0001$$$::I wonder about it absently, but I can't remember a time I ever heard distant thunder.::
72623::$$$message_0666_0002_0000$$$::...The dagger in my hand began to crumble as soon as Saber disappeared back into the shadows.[lr]::
72624::$$$message_0666_0002_0001$$$::It's probably the cost of killing a powerful familiar like a Servant.[lr]::
72625::$$$message_0666_0002_0002$$$::The Azoth Blade that Tohsaka put her life savings into has crumbled to dust.::
72626::$$$message_0666_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72627::$$$message_0666_0003_0001$$$::I tightly fasten the bindings on my left arm.[lr]::
72628::$$$message_0666_0003_0002$$$::I've used up most of my magical energy.[lr]::
72629::$$$message_0666_0003_0003$$$::There's some left in Archer's arm, and some left in me.[lr]::
72630::$$$message_0666_0003_0004$$$::I think I can manage with that combined power, but I'm limited to one last Projection. I won't be able to control Archer's arm anymore, no matter what I do afterwards.::
72631::$$$message_0666_0004_0000$$$::"Ri...der..."[lr]::
72632::$$$message_0666_0004_0001$$$::Oh, right. I wonder what happened to her.[lr]::
72633::$$$message_0666_0004_0002$$$::I stand up.::
72634::$$$message_0666_0005_0000$$$::My body feels hard.[lr]::
72635::$$$message_0666_0005_0001$$$::It feels like my joints have turned into steel.[lr]::
72636::$$$message_0666_0005_0002$$$::I bet bullets would bounce off me now.::
72637::$$$message_0666_0006_0000$$$::"Rider, are you all right?"[lr]::
72638::$$$message_0666_0006_0001$$$::I can't walk very well.[lr]::
72639::$$$message_0666_0006_0002$$$::I walk.::
72640::$$$message_0666_0007_0000$$$::I'm bleeding.[lr]::
72641::$$$message_0666_0007_0001$$$::I pretend not to see it.[lr]::
72642::$$$message_0666_0007_0002$$$::The pain feels like someone drove iron stakes into my legs, but luckily, I can grit my teeth and walk through it.::
72643::$$$message_0666_0008_0000$$$::...Something is making a sound, far away.[lr]::
72644::$$$message_0666_0008_0001$$$::It sounds like something I heard a long time ago, when I was a kid.[lr]::
72645::$$$message_0666_0008_0002$$$::The fact I can remember things I heard that long ago must mean I'm still a kid at heart.[lr]::
72646::$$$message_0666_0008_0003$$$::I had a lot of interests when I was a kid.::
72647::$$$message_0666_0009_0000$$$::"Rider."[lr]::
72648::$$$message_0666_0009_0001$$$::I walk up to the wall she got smashed into.[lr]::
72649::$$$message_0666_0009_0002$$$::Rider's still alive.[lr]::
72650::$$$message_0666_0009_0003$$$::But she's beat up all over, and most of her magical energy is spent.[lr]::
72651::$$$message_0666_0009_0004$$$::She probably can't move right away.[lr]::
72652::$$$message_0666_0009_0005$$$::...She should take a break.::
72653::$$$message_0666_0010_0000$$$::"I'm going on ahead. Catch up later once you can run."[lr]::
72654::$$$message_0666_0010_0001$$$::I mutter at the fallen Rider, and turn to go deeper into the cave.::
72655::$$$message_0666_0011_0000$$$::"Ngh...urgh. You're more of a slave driver than I expected."[lr]::
72656::$$$message_0666_0011_0001$$$::Looks like she's conscious.[lr]::
72657::$$$message_0666_0011_0002$$$::Rider can't stand up right away, and she looks up like something's very bright.::
72658::$$$message_0666_0012_0000$$$::"Sorry. I know I'm leaning a lot on you. Take some time to recover and then catch up."[lr]::
72659::$$$message_0666_0012_0001$$$::"...Yes. I'll be right there. Don't worry."::
72660::$$$message_0666_0013_0000$$$::Rider won't push herself too hard.[lr]::
72661::$$$message_0666_0013_0001$$$::She knows that she should take time to properly recover instead of forcing herself to get up.[lr]::
72662::$$$message_0666_0013_0002$$$::She isn't reckless like me. It's so reassuring.::
72663::$$$message_0666_0014_0000$$$::...The tremors are happening more often.[lr]::
72664::$$$message_0666_0014_0001$$$::I can't waste time here.[lr]::
72665::$$$message_0666_0014_0002$$$::I go after Tohsaka, though I can't move my body very well.::
72666::$$$message_0666_0015_0000$$$::"Ngh... Hah, haah."[lr]::
72667::$$$message_0666_0015_0001$$$::I'm getting breathless.[lr]::
72668::$$$message_0666_0015_0002$$$::I use the wall to support myself as I move forward.[lr]::
72669::$$$message_0666_0015_0003$$$::My pace isn't bad.[lr]::
72670::$$$message_0666_0015_0004$$$::My body just feels stiff, but it shouldn't get in the way once I get used to it.::
72671::$$$message_0666_0016_0000$$$::"Burgh...ngh, hah, gugh, guh."[lr]::
72672::$$$message_0666_0016_0001$$$::Something comes out of my mouth.[lr]::
72673::$$$message_0666_0016_0002$$$::I pretend not to notice it and wipe my lips.::
72674::$$$message_0666_0017_0000$$$::"Zzrgh, agh..."[lr]::
72675::$$$message_0666_0017_0001$$$::My thigh muscles go [font italic=true]snap[font italic=false] and feel numb. I nearly trip over.[lr]::
72676::$$$message_0666_0017_0002$$$::I'm pretty sure I heard a snap.[lr]::
72677::$$$message_0666_0017_0003$$$::My clothes are torn [font italic=true]from the inside[font italic=false], and I can see gaping wounds.[lr]::
72678::$$$message_0666_0017_0004$$$::I do my best not to look at them and keep walking.::
72679::$$$message_0666_0018_0000$$$::    I'm close.[lr]::
72680::$$$message_0666_0018_0001$$$::A lukewarm wind brushes against my body.[lr]::
72681::$$$message_0666_0018_0002$$$::"...Here goes."[lr]::
72682::$$$message_0666_0018_0003$$$::I clap my cheeks and start running.::
72683::$$$message_0666_0019_0000$$$::I leave the darkness.[lr]::
72684::$$$message_0666_0019_0001$$$::A wasteland I've seen before spreads out before me, filling my vision.[lr]::
72685::$$$message_0666_0019_0002$$$::No, not quite.[lr]::
72686::$$$message_0666_0019_0003$$$::I haven't seen this sight before.[lr]::
72687::$$$message_0666_0019_0004$$$::[font italic=true]That[font italic=false] didn't exist in the wasteland I saw in Illya's record.::
72688::$$$message_0666_0020_0000$$$::"That's..."[lr]::
72689::$$$message_0666_0020_0001$$$::The root cause of this absurd war.[lr]::
72690::$$$message_0666_0020_0002$$$::The thing that took Sakura from me.::
72691::$$$message_0666_0021_0000$$$::"It's almost incarnated..."[lr]::
72692::$$$message_0666_0021_0001$$$::I'm assailed by a sense of menace and revulsion.[lr]::
72693::$$$message_0666_0021_0002$$$::Its excessively vital breathing declares that it's on the cusp of its birth.::
72694::$$$message_0666_0022_0000$$$::Flashes of light and tremors.[lr]::
72695::$$$message_0666_0022_0001$$$::The light lashes out from the top of the cliff, haphazardly blasting the cavern.[lr]::
72696::$$$message_0666_0022_0002$$$::...I don't know what's happening up there, but given how flashy it is, it can only be Tohsaka.::
72697::$$$message_0666_0023_0000$$$::Which means...I see.[lr]::
72698::$$$message_0666_0023_0001$$$::"You're panicking."[lr]::
72699::$$$message_0666_0023_0002$$$::I look around.[lr]::
72700::$$$message_0666_0023_0003$$$::The eyeless, twisted fetus is looking at me.::
72701::$$$message_0666_0024_0000$$$::...No doubt about it.[lr]::
72702::$$$message_0666_0024_0001$$$::It must not like Tohsaka's rampage very much, because it really wants to come out.[lr]::
72703::$$$message_0666_0024_0002$$$::But its body isn't ready yet.[lr]::
72704::$$$message_0666_0024_0003$$$::Its placenta is inside that dark pillar.[lr]::
72705::$$$message_0666_0024_0004$$$::It can't come out unless its body is fully formed.::
72706::$$$message_0666_0025_0000$$$::That's why it's worried that Tohsaka will destroy its placenta, and it's rushing to finish its body.[lr]::
72707::$$$message_0666_0025_0001$$$::It wants to be born in this world as a Servant with a flesh-and-blood body.::
72708::$$$message_0666_0026_0000$$$::"...Not on my watch."[lr]::
72709::$$$message_0666_0026_0001$$$::I run.[lr]::
72710::$$$message_0666_0026_0002$$$::I see a desperate clash of light and darkness.::
72711::$$$message_0666_0027_0000$$$::"Sakura...?"[lr]::
72712::$$$message_0666_0027_0001$$$::Once I get close enough to make out Sakura and Tohsaka fighting...[lr]::
72713::$$$message_0666_0027_0002$$$::Time stops in the cavern.[lr]::
72714::$$$message_0666_0027_0003$$$::An enormous source of light blinds me enough to feel that way, and...::
72715::$$$message_0666_0028_0000$$$::"Nee-san."[lr]::
72716::$$$message_0666_0028_0001$$$::I hear a child-like wail, and the world begins to shake violently.::
72717::$$$message_0666_0029_0000$$$::The light didn't destroy the chamber walls.[lr]::
72718::$$$message_0666_0029_0001$$$::This is destruction on a more fundamental level. It's the frenzied squirming of that giant shadow attempting to come out.::
72719::$$$message_0666_0030_0000$$$::"That was..."[lr]::
72720::$$$message_0666_0030_0001$$$::A horrible chill runs down my spine.[lr]::
72721::$$$message_0666_0030_0002$$$::I have an ominous feeling.[lr]::
72722::$$$message_0666_0030_0003$$$::Sakura's wailing voice prophesies the worst thing I could see.::
72723::$$$message_0666_0031_0000$$$::"Tohsaka...Tohsaka, Tohsaka!"[lr]::
72724::$$$message_0666_0031_0001$$$::I run.[lr]::
72725::$$$message_0666_0031_0002$$$::Breathing wildly, I scramble up the cliff using [line5]-afflicted limbs.::
72726::$$$message_0666_0032_0000$$$::    The tremors won't stop.[lr]::
72727::$$$message_0666_0032_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Boom.[font italic=false][lr]::
72728::$$$message_0666_0032_0002$$$::Somewhere in the wasteland, I hear a large boulder fall.::
72729::$$$message_0666_0033_0000$$$::"Hah... Haah, haah, haah, hah...!"[lr]::
72730::$$$message_0666_0033_0001$$$::I don't care what's going on behind me.[lr]::
72731::$$$message_0666_0033_0002$$$::Covered in dirt, I single-mindedly climb the cliff,[lr]::
72732::$$$message_0666_0033_0003$$$::and a scene that I was too late to stop is burned into my eyes.::
72733::$$$message_0666_0034_0000$$$::"......Tohsaka."[lr]::
72734::$$$message_0666_0034_0001$$$::...The ground is shaking.[lr]::
72735::$$$message_0666_0034_0002$$$::Tohsaka's sprawled face down, and I can't see her face.[lr]::
72736::$$$message_0666_0034_0003$$$::She resembles a large flower fallen from its stem.::
72737::$$$message_0666_0035_0000$$$::"...............Sen...pai."[lr]::
72738::$$$message_0666_0035_0001$$$::I look up.[lr]::
72739::$$$message_0666_0035_0002$$$::Beyond Tohsaka,[lr]::
72740::$$$message_0666_0035_0003$$$::I see Sakura, berating herself and backing away from her bloodstained sister.:èé
