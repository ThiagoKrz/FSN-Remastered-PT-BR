58453::$$$message_0523_0000_0000$$$::...Right.[lr]::
58454::$$$message_0523_0000_0001$$$::If I burst into the room while Sakura's changing, I won't hear the end of it from Fuji-nee for an entire year.::
58455::$$$message_0523_0001_0000$$$::"No, the point is that it would be wrong to do that to Sakura!"[lr]::
58456::$$$message_0523_0001_0001$$$::Yup, now is the time for patience.[lr]::
58457::$$$message_0523_0001_0002$$$::For all I know, she could already be done and drying her hair off.::
58458::$$$message_0523_0002_0000$$$::"You look unsettled, Shirou."[lr]::
58459::$$$message_0523_0002_0001$$$::"Huh? N-no I don't. I'm eating mandarins and drinking tea."[lr]::
58460::$$$message_0523_0002_0002$$$::"Haah. You've barely laid a hand on the fruit or tea, and you keep glancing at the clock. Is that what you call resting?"::
58461::$$$message_0523_0003_0000$$$::"Oof. Well, I'm full, so I don't have much of an appetite."[lr]::
58462::$$$message_0523_0003_0001$$$::"Indeed? If you say so, Shirou. I don't believe in excessive self-restraint, however."::
58463::$$$message_0523_0004_0000$$$::Saber takes a graceful sip of tea.[lr]::
58464::$$$message_0523_0004_0001$$$::...God, I'm pathetic.[lr]::
58465::$$$message_0523_0004_0002$$$::It hasn't even been five minutes, but I can't stop thinking about Sakura.::
58466::$$$message_0523_0005_0000$$$::"Damn it, I don't care what Fuji-nee says![lr]::
58467::$$$message_0523_0005_0001$$$::Saber, I'm going to the bathroom!"[lr]::
58468::$$$message_0523_0005_0002$$$::I grit my teeth and stand up.[lr]::
58469::$$$message_0523_0005_0003$$$::Just as I do,[lr]::
58470::$$$message_0523_0005_0004$$$::Fuji-nee comes hurtling out of the hallway.::
58471::$$$message_0523_0006_0000$$$::"Fuji-nee...? What's the rush? Weren't you getting Sakura's clothes ready?"[lr]::
58472::$$$message_0523_0006_0001$$$::"I just finished. Never mind that, Shirou. Look after Sakura. I'm going home to get some fever medication."[lr]::
58473::$$$message_0523_0006_0002$$$::"!? What do you mean? What happened?"::
58474::$$$message_0523_0007_0000$$$::"I wish I knew. I found Sakura collapsed on the floor of the dressing room, and her temperature was almost 38 degrees."::
58475::$$$message_0523_0008_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]Sakura collapsed!?"[lr]::
58476::$$$message_0523_0008_0001$$$::"She's sleeping in the guestroom now. It looks like she only caught a cold, you can relax.[lr]::
58477::$$$message_0523_0008_0002$$$::But don't let her push herself. I'll bring a bunch of stuff from home, so you stay with her. That alone will make Sakura feel better."::
58478::$$$message_0523_0009_0000$$$::Fuji-nee snaps off a series of orders, then heads home to the Fujimura estate.[lr]::
58479::$$$message_0523_0009_0001$$$::Fuji-nee's house hosts a lot of young, hot-blooded people, so it's well-equipped to handle the sick and wounded.::
58480::$$$message_0523_0010_0000$$$::"Argh...!"[lr]::
58481::$$$message_0523_0010_0001$$$::I can't freeze now.[lr]::
58482::$$$message_0523_0010_0002$$$::I don't know what happened, but I need to check on Sakura first!::
58483::$$$message_0523_0011_0000$$$::"Your fever's a tad over 37 degrees. Huh. That's lower than I expected."[lr]::
58484::$$$message_0523_0011_0001$$$::I shake the thermometer and look at Sakura, who's lying in bed.[lr]::
58485::$$$message_0523_0011_0002$$$::It's been thirty minutes.[lr]::
58486::$$$message_0523_0011_0003$$$::Like Fuji-nee said, Sakura's condition isn't too serious. It seems like she passed out in the dressing room because she had a light cold, took a long bath, and got lightheaded when she stood up.::
58487::$$$message_0523_0012_0000$$$::"I'm sorry... I must have gotten dizzy after getting into the bath in such a nervous state."[lr]::
58488::$$$message_0523_0012_0001$$$::Sakura guiltily hides her face under the covers.::
58489::$$$message_0523_0013_0000$$$::"Well, there's no helping the fact that you're sick. A cold like this should heal with medicine and some rest, so try and take it easy for tonight.[lr]::
58490::$$$message_0523_0013_0001$$$::I'll leave water on this chair. Try not to go outside, all right? You'll get a chill."[lr]::
58491::$$$message_0523_0013_0002$$$::Just in case, I put on another blanket over her and turn off the lights.::
58492::$$$message_0523_0014_0000$$$::"See ya tomorrow. I'll come wake you up, so take it easy."[lr]::
58493::$$$message_0523_0014_0001$$$::I give Sakura an affectionate pat on the head and make for the door.[lr]::
58494::$$$message_0523_0014_0002$$$::"...Okay. Good night, Senpai."[lr]::
58495::$$$message_0523_0014_0003$$$::Sakura sounds apologetic.[lr]::
58496::$$$message_0523_0014_0004$$$::I reciprocate her good-night, and leave the guestroom.::n°
