69153::$$$message_0637_0000_0000$$$::...I remember.[lr]::
69154::$$$message_0637_0000_0001$$$::Before, Rider asked me a question under the stars.[lr]::
69155::$$$message_0637_0000_0002$$$::She wanted to know whether I would be on Sakura's side until the very end, no matter what.::
69156::$$$message_0637_0001_0000$$$::I couldn't answer back then.[lr]::
69157::$$$message_0637_0001_0001$$$::But now, I can say it with pride.::
69158::$$$message_0637_0002_0000$$$::"Rider. I know Sakura is important to you.[lr]::
69159::$$$message_0637_0002_0001$$$::Even now, you're here to stop me from leaving because it would make Sakura suffer."::
69160::$$$message_0637_0003_0000$$$::"...Yes. Are you going to go kill Sakura despite that, Shirou?"[lr]::
69161::$$$message_0637_0003_0001$$$::"I'm not going to kill her. I'm going to save her.[lr]::
69162::$$$message_0637_0003_0002$$$::Rider, I'll protect Sakura until the very end. No matter what happens, I will always choose her."::
69163::$$$message_0637_0004_0000$$$::"But to do that...I need your help. Tohsaka and I can't save her alone. If you really care about Sakura, then please help me, just this once."::
69164::$$$message_0637_0005_0000$$$::"Is that...[lr]::
69165::$$$message_0637_0005_0001$$$::...your answer to the question I asked before?"[lr]::
69166::$$$message_0637_0005_0002$$$::I nod silently.::
69167::$$$message_0637_0006_0000$$$::"...Very well.[lr]::
69168::$$$message_0637_0006_0001$$$::But I will not participate in a battle with no chance of victory. What do you expect me to do, Shirou?"::
69169::$$$message_0637_0007_0000$$$::What I expect Rider to do?[lr]::
69170::$$$message_0637_0007_0001$$$::There's only one thing.[lr]::
69171::$$$message_0637_0007_0002$$$::Out of all the Servants in this war, Rider is the only one with a Noble Phantasm that can resist Saber's Noble Phantasm which is Sakura's most powerful card.::
69172::$$$message_0637_0008_0000$$$::"I have a question for you first. Can you use your Noble Phantasm right now?"[lr]::
69173::$$$message_0637_0008_0001$$$::"Yes. Sakura still provides me with magical energy."::
69174::$$$message_0637_0009_0000$$$::"Next question: Servants are classified as spiritual bodies even when you're in material form, right? If so, is it true that normal weapons can't harm a Servant?"::
69175::$$$message_0637_0010_0000$$$::"...I would say that a normal Servant would render such attacks ineffective, but it is different for the Servants under Sakura's thrall.[lr]::
69176::$$$message_0637_0010_0001$$$::Saber is a being given flesh, who cannot return to spirit form.[lr]::
69177::$$$message_0637_0010_0002$$$::A powerful magical implement could pierce the black armor that protects them."::
69178::$$$message_0637_0011_0000$$$::"...I see. Then that settles it. We have a chance, and I know exactly what you can do to help.[lr]::
69179::$$$message_0637_0011_0001$$$::Rider, I want you to beat Saber one-on-one. To be specific..."::
69180::$$$message_0637_0012_0000$$$::I whisper in Rider's ear.[lr]::
69181::$$$message_0637_0012_0001$$$::...It's not like anyone's listening to us, but I'm just being safe.::
69182::$$$message_0637_0013_0000$$$::"...I see. That would allow us to break through.[lr]::
69183::$$$message_0637_0013_0001$$$::It is a contest of brute force, at any rate. We don't need to worry about complications."[lr]::
69184::$$$message_0637_0013_0002$$$::"Right? If there is a problem, it would be..."::
69185::$$$message_0637_0014_0000$$$::"Your skills, and how much I can trust them."::
69186::$$$message_0637_0015_0000$$$::I nod.[lr]::
69187::$$$message_0637_0015_0001$$$::Rider pauses for a moment, placing a finger on her lips in contemplation.[lr]::
69188::$$$message_0637_0015_0002$$$::"I understand. I will trust you and temporarily recognize you as my Master."[lr]::
69189::$$$message_0637_0015_0003$$$::Then she agrees to my suggestion with a surprisingly lovely smile.::
