53440::$$$message_0462_0000_0000$$$::When I awake to the bright sunshine, my body feels completely recovered.[lr]::
53441::$$$message_0462_0000_0001$$$::My temperature is normal, and my limbs don't feel heavy anymore.::
53442::$$$message_0462_0001_0000$$$::"It's still before six, huh? I wonder if Sakura's awake."[lr]::
53443::$$$message_0462_0001_0001$$$::If she is, then she should be preparing breakfast.[lr]::
53444::$$$message_0462_0001_0002$$$::If I don't change and go to the kitchen soon, she'll have to do it all by herself.::
53445::$$$message_0462_0002_0000$$$::"I'm going on ahead, Saber. Come to the living room in a bit."[lr]::
53446::$$$message_0462_0002_0001$$$::I'm not brave enough to slide open the partition, so I just tell her and retreat.[lr]::
53447::$$$message_0462_0002_0002$$$::It could be bad if I open the door with unlucky timing and see Saber sleeping.::
53448::$$$message_0462_0003_0000$$$::"And then grandpa fell down.[lr]::
53449::$$$message_0462_0003_0001$$$::He was like, 'I'm trying to get some sleep! Settle down, tiger cub!'[lr]::
53450::$$$message_0462_0003_0002$$$::How rude. That makes me sound like a stray cloud!"::
53451::$$$message_0462_0004_0000$$$::Fuji-nee pouts, going on about something unfair as she eats.[lr]::
53452::$$$message_0462_0004_0001$$$::Evidently, she didn't come over last night because her grandfather collapsed.::
53453::$$$message_0462_0005_0000$$$::"? Senpai? What's a stray cloud?"[lr]::
53454::$$$message_0462_0005_0001$$$::"It's literally Fuji-nee. Someone who you just can't get a handle on because they're so floaty and carefree."[lr]::
53455::$$$message_0462_0005_0002$$$::I answer instantly.::
53456::$$$message_0462_0006_0000$$$::"Not true! It means 'deadbeat!'[lr]::
53457::$$$message_0462_0006_0001$$$::In other words, someone who goes around all day doing nothing but making fun of people in town, and living a comical life!"::
53458::$$$message_0462_0007_0000$$$::Sakura and Saber nod in understanding.[lr]::
53459::$$$message_0462_0007_0001$$$::It goes without saying which part of that they agree with.::
53460::$$$message_0462_0008_0000$$$::"Ms. Fujimura, is your grandfather in poor health?"[lr]::
53461::$$$message_0462_0008_0001$$$::"No way. Our family's famous for never catching colds. Grandpa just threw his hip out because he forgot his age and tried to sumo wrestle one of the younger guys."[lr]::
53462::$$$message_0462_0008_0002$$$::"Sumo? What is sumo, Taiga?"::
53463::$$$message_0462_0009_0000$$$::"Huh? Hmm, it's a little hard to explain in words. It's a martial art where you push no matter what. If they pull, you push. If they push, you push back. It doesn't use any weapons, but fists aren't allowed. No kicking, either.[lr]::
53464::$$$message_0462_0009_0001$$$::Basically, you win if you get a good grip on your opponent's body and throw 'em on the ground!"::
53465::$$$message_0462_0010_0000$$$::"...Hm. So it is a pure contest of strength?"[lr]::
53466::$$$message_0462_0010_0001$$$::"Yeah. And no clothes. Both fighters get naked and go man-to-man."::
53467::$$$message_0462_0011_0000$$$::"N-naked!?"[lr]::
53468::$$$message_0462_0011_0001$$$::"Yup. They wear a mawashi to hide their private parts, though. Oh, a mawashi is the same as a fundoshi. If you want to know more, ask Shirou. He knows more about this stuff than me."[lr]::
53469::$$$message_0462_0011_0002$$$::Fuji-nee slurps her miso soup while saying something outrageous about me.::
53470::$$$message_0462_0012_0000$$$::"I see. Shirou, what is a fundoshi?"[lr]::
53471::$$$message_0462_0012_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
53472::$$$message_0462_0012_0002$$$::It would be easy to explain, but I hesitate.[lr]::
53473::$$$message_0462_0012_0003$$$::This is Saber I'm talking to, and it's the middle of breakfast.[lr]::
53474::$$$message_0462_0012_0004$$$::Why do we have to talk about underwear?::
53475::$$$message_0462_0013_0000$$$::"...No idea. Sumo's not in my wheelhouse. Ask someone else."[lr]::
53476::$$$message_0462_0013_0001$$$::"Liar. You have a mawashi!"::
53477::$$$message_0462_0014_0000$$$::"N-no, I don't! Your gramps just made me do sumo that one time so I borrowed one![lr]::
53478::$$$message_0462_0014_0001$$$::And how many years ago are we talking here!?"::
53479::$$$message_0462_0015_0000$$$::"Ahahaha, that's right. You were little back then, so you kept losing at sumo. Grandfather said you should try a different sport since you won't give up until you win, so he made you pick up a bow, instead."::
53480::$$$message_0462_0016_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
53481::$$$message_0462_0016_0001$$$::Fuji-nee laughs in delight.[lr]::
53482::$$$message_0462_0016_0002$$$::...I wonder why.[lr]::
53483::$$$message_0462_0016_0003$$$::She's in an awfully good mood today, and twenty percent more lively than usual.::
53484::$$$message_0462_0017_0000$$$::"Hey, Fuji-nee. Clock's ticking. Don't you need to get out of here before seven to be on time?"[lr]::
53485::$$$message_0462_0017_0001$$$::"Hm? Oh, today's fine. They cancelled all morning club activities yesterday. But yeah, I do have a faculty meeting, so I'd better get going soon."::
53486::$$$message_0462_0018_0000$$$::"Huh? Is the kyudo club skipping morning practice?"[lr]::
53487::$$$message_0462_0018_0001$$$::"Yeah. Oh right, I didn't tell you yet. There was a small accident yesterday. Someone in the track and field club got injured. Ms. Kasama in the infirmary said that they didn't get enough sleep, so we should cancel morning practice for now."::
53488::$$$message_0462_0019_0000$$$::"...Huh. But do they really need to stop everything just for one student?[lr]::
53489::$$$message_0462_0019_0001$$$::And if they didn't get enough sleep, isn't that their own..."[lr]::
53490::$$$message_0462_0019_0002$$$::It's their own responsibility to go to bed on time. But maybe...::
53491::$$$message_0462_0020_0000$$$::"Fuji-nee. Exactly how many students got hurt?"[lr]::
53492::$$$message_0462_0020_0001$$$::"Hmm...more than ten, but less than twenty, I think?"[lr]::
53493::$$$message_0462_0020_0002$$$::"Th-that many?[lr]::
53494::$$$message_0462_0020_0003$$$::How is everyone else in the kyudo club[line2]"::
53495::$$$message_0462_0021_0000$$$::"So, nobody in our club got hurt, but several of them looked pretty tired yesterday.[lr]::
53496::$$$message_0462_0021_0001$$$::...And things are pretty dangerous lately, you know? I can't ignore students' mental fatigue either, so I made the decision not to stress them out any more than necessary. Club itself isn't a source of stress, but you gotta admit it puts a physical burden on them."[lr]::
53497::$$$message_0462_0021_0002$$$::Fuji-nee shrugs in exasperation and holds out her bowl.::
53498::$$$message_0462_0022_0000$$$::"Seconds, please. I'll have half a bowl of rice."[lr]::
53499::$$$message_0462_0022_0001$$$::"Here you go. You're not eating much this morning."[lr]::
53500::$$$message_0462_0022_0002$$$::"Yeah... I'm feeling queasy just thinking about all the work waiting for me at school, so I don't have an appetite."::
53501::$$$message_0462_0023_0000$$$::She half-sobs pitifully.[lr]::
53502::$$$message_0462_0023_0001$$$::Hm.[lr]::
53503::$$$message_0462_0023_0002$$$::Apparently, our resident tiger is saying that she can't go all-out on two and a half bowls of rice.::
53504::$$$message_0462_0024_0000$$$::"But you seem good today, Sakura. You're on your second bowl."[lr]::
53505::$$$message_0462_0024_0001$$$::"I'm in a growing period. Lately, I get hungry right away, so I need to eat more to get my fill."::
53506::$$$message_0462_0025_0000$$$::Sakura proudly puffs up her chest.[lr]::
53507::$$$message_0462_0025_0001$$$::Um...[lr]::
53508::$$$message_0462_0025_0002$$$::I'd say she's already had her growth spurt and she's good as she is. Maybe she's just being influenced by the other gluttons in the house.::
53509::$$$message_0462_0026_0000$$$::"Indeed. Sakura, you lack sufficient muscle to be an archer. I think nutrition would be good for you."[lr]::
53510::$$$message_0462_0026_0001$$$::Saber nods through a mouthful of food.[lr]::
53511::$$$message_0462_0026_0002$$$::...I can't tell if they're on the same page or not.::ç›
