57325::$$$message_0509_0000_0002$$$::I close in Tohsaka until I've got her backed up against a wall.[lr]::
57326::$$$message_0509_0000_0003$$$::Given the subject matter, I can't let the students around us hear.::

57337::$$$message_0509_0005_0001$$$::...Belatedly, I come to my senses while my cheeks go beet red.[lr]::
