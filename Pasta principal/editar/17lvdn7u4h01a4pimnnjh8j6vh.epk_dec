55673::$$$message_0494_0000_0001$$$::I wait for Tohsaka by the school gate.[lr]::
55674::$$$message_0494_0000_0002$$$::The sky is all gray, and it looks like it's about to rain.[lr]::
55675::$$$message_0494_0000_0003$$$::Not to mention this chilly wind. It's going to be a cold night if there's wind.::
55676::$$$message_0494_0001_0000$$$::"What're you thinking about?"[lr]::
55677::$$$message_0494_0001_0001$$$::   I return to reality.[lr]::
55678::$$$message_0494_0001_0002$$$::Tohsaka's here.[lr]::
55679::$$$message_0494_0001_0003$$$::Her shoulders are slightly heaving, like she ran here.::
55680::$$$message_0494_0002_0000$$$::"I was just thinking it's gonna rain."[lr]::
55681::$$$message_0494_0002_0001$$$::"Yeah. Looks like it'll just be a drizzle. We need to patrol tonight, so I hope it doesn't come down too hard."::
55682::$$$message_0494_0003_0000$$$::...Hm.[lr]::
55683::$$$message_0494_0003_0001$$$::From the sound of that, Tohsaka expects us to go on patrol tonight.[lr]::
55684::$$$message_0494_0003_0002$$$::I'd like that too, but I should check in on Sakura at home before that.::
55685::$$$message_0494_0004_0000$$$::"About that, Tohsaka[line2]"[lr]::
55686::$$$message_0494_0004_0001$$$::"I know. We're allies now, so I'm going to pound some skills into you. We'll make a proper mage out of you yet."::
55687::$$$message_0494_0005_0000$$$::With a bold declaration, Tohsaka starts down the path home.[lr]::
55688::$$$message_0494_0005_0001$$$::...Uh oh.[lr]::
55689::$$$message_0494_0005_0002$$$::If you smile at me like that, how am I supposed to say I need to go home early today...?::
55690::$$$message_0494_0006_0000$$$::We take the long path up the hill, south of the intersection.[lr]::
55691::$$$message_0494_0006_0001$$$::We're coming up on the neighborhood with European houses.[lr]::
55692::$$$message_0494_0006_0002$$$::Tohsaka's house is situated at the top of the hill, much higher than Sakura's.::
55693::$$$message_0494_0007_0000$$$::"Wow..."[lr]::
55694::$$$message_0494_0007_0001$$$::So this is the Tohsaka mansion.[lr]::
55695::$$$message_0494_0007_0002$$$::How do I put it... Sakura's house is big, but this one really grabs the eye with its European feel.::
55696::$$$message_0494_0008_0000$$$::...It also feels cold and heartless, somehow.[lr]::
55697::$$$message_0494_0008_0001$$$::The air around the entire top of the hill feels like it rejects visitors.::
55698::$$$message_0494_0009_0000$$$::"What are you stopping for? This is my house."[lr]::
55699::$$$message_0494_0009_0001$$$::"Uh... Yeah, I know. I'm just a little overwhelmed."::
55700::$$$message_0494_0010_0000$$$::"...Yeah. It's different from your place. I'm sure even you, with your dull magical senses, can feel how cold it is."[lr]::
55701::$$$message_0494_0010_0001$$$::Tohsaka continues walking with a bored tone.::
55702::$$$message_0494_0011_0000$$$::"Come on, hurry up. I didn't set any traps, so you don't need to hesitate."[lr]::
55703::$$$message_0494_0011_0001$$$::Tohsaka beckons me in from her front door.::
55704::$$$message_0494_0012_0000$$$::"...'Hesitating' isn't quite what this place makes me want to do."[lr]::
55705::$$$message_0494_0012_0001$$$::Grumbling, I steel myself and step through the threshold.::
55706::$$$message_0494_0013_0000$$$::...It does feel cold, but my mind is elsewhere.[lr]::
55707::$$$message_0494_0013_0001$$$::She has no idea what a big deal it is for a guy to get invited over to Rin Tohsaka's house.[lr]::
55708::$$$message_0494_0013_0002$$$::...She wouldn't understand even if I explained. At best, she would just laugh at me.::
55709::$$$message_0494_0014_0000$$$::    On top of that...::
55710::$$$message_0494_0015_0000$$$::"W-why are we doing this in your bedroom instead of the parlor!?"::
55711::$$$message_0494_0016_0000$$$::After showing me the parlor, Tohsaka took me up to her room like it was the most natural thing.::
55712::$$$message_0494_0017_0000$$$::"Because all my tools are here, obviously.[lr]::
55713::$$$message_0494_0017_0001$$$::The parlor is for drinking tea, and that's not why you're here."[lr]::
55714::$$$message_0494_0017_0002$$$::"Ah...oof. Well, yeah, but..."[lr]::
55715::$$$message_0494_0017_0003$$$::I wish she'd remember that I'm a same-age member of the opposite sex.::
55716::$$$message_0494_0018_0000$$$::"? Anyway, just sit wherever. I'm going to consecrate you with sage and cards, so tell me now if you can't handle either of those."::
55717::$$$message_0494_0019_0000$$$::Tohsaka opens a box next to her bed.[lr]::
55718::$$$message_0494_0019_0001$$$::It's filled with treasures straight out of an adventure movie.::
55719::$$$message_0494_0020_0000$$$::"Um... Guess I'll have to use Grandmaster Kischur's agate... Oh, I'm out of sage. Go downstairs and grab me two or three sprigs, Archer."[lr]::
55720::$$$message_0494_0020_0001$$$::"Scarlet sage, right? ...I don't think you need to go to such lengths to identify him."::
55721::$$$message_0494_0021_0000$$$::"That's my decision. Go rest downstairs after you bring it. We have an alliance now, so you don't need to guard my every step."[lr]::
55722::$$$message_0494_0021_0001$$$::"You're right. He doesn't have the guts to lay a hand on you. I'll prepare for tonight."::
55723::$$$message_0494_0022_0000$$$::That must have been Archer.[lr]::
55724::$$$message_0494_0022_0001$$$::I couldn't sense his enormous magical energy at all. Maybe it's reduced while he's in spirit form.::
55725::$$$message_0494_0023_0000$$$::"Wow. I didn't even notice he was in the same room."[lr]::
55726::$$$message_0494_0023_0001$$$::"That's how it is when he's in spirit form. Even if he takes physical form, his energy won't leak out as long as he's in the mansion. Isolating your magical energy from the outside is one of the most basic steps of building an atelier."::
55727::$$$message_0494_0024_0000$$$::"Huh. Does that go for the Makiri[line2]I mean, the Matous, too?"[lr]::
55728::$$$message_0494_0024_0001$$$::"Yeah, though they don't need to hide it, so if there's anything they'd need to hide, it isn't the magical energy of the atelier, but of the mage itself."::
55729::$$$message_0494_0025_0000$$$::"One way or another, I hide his magical energy. I was going to bring Archer to school, but he isn't in top condition right now so I leave him at home during the day."::
55730::$$$message_0494_0026_0000$$$::Tohsaka rummages around in her treasure chest while making a troubled expression.[lr]::
55731::$$$message_0494_0026_0001$$$::...It looks like she can't find what she's looking for. Is she actually really disorganized?::
55732::$$$message_0494_0027_0000$$$::"...Honestly, he should be able to heal his injuries easily, so why won't the wound Saber gave him heal? All I can think of is that they must have some connection... Hey, why can't I find anything in here besides the Grandmaster's jewels? Normally, these wouldn't appear at all, dang it!"::
55733::$$$message_0494_0028_0000$$$::She literally throws herself into her search.[lr]::
55734::$$$message_0494_0028_0001$$$::...The chest looks small, but it's apparently deep enough to swallow Tohsaka whole.::
55735::$$$message_0494_0029_0000$$$::"Haah..."[lr]::
55736::$$$message_0494_0029_0001$$$::Anyway, there's nothing to grit my teeth for at the moment.[lr]::
55737::$$$message_0494_0029_0002$$$::At most, I can pray that Tohsaka finds whatever she's looking for. I absently look around the room.::
55738::$$$message_0494_0030_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
55739::$$$message_0494_0030_0001$$$::And I see...[lr]::
55740::$$$message_0494_0030_0002$$$::...something incredible.::
55741::$$$message_0494_0031_0000$$$::   It's a photograph.[lr]::
55742::$$$message_0494_0031_0001$$$::I find it on a bookshelf no higher than my waist, in the corner of the room.[lr]::
55743::$$$message_0494_0031_0002$$$::The photo is on top, like it was forgotten there.[lr]::
55744::$$$message_0494_0031_0003$$$::Dust comes off when I touch it, indicating that it's been here for a while.::
55745::$$$message_0494_0032_0000$$$::"She doesn't clean...? No, of course not. She just doesn't touch this photo."[lr]::
55746::$$$message_0494_0032_0001$$$::Maybe Tohsaka doesn't like looking at pictures from her childhood.[lr]::
55747::$$$message_0494_0032_0002$$$::...But then she wouldn't leave this out here. It's something important that she doesn't want to touch, I guess.::
55748::$$$message_0494_0033_0000$$$::"...Still, though."[lr]::
55749::$$$message_0494_0033_0001$$$::People sure do change.[lr]::
55750::$$$message_0494_0033_0002$$$::In the picture, Tohsaka is five or six years old, and she's, well, totally adorable.::
55751::$$$message_0494_0034_0000$$$::"...So her hair's always been long. Wait, huh?"[lr]::
55752::$$$message_0494_0034_0001$$$::In the photo, Tohsaka's wearing the same style she does now.[lr]::
55753::$$$message_0494_0034_0002$$$::But one difference catches my eye.::
55754::$$$message_0494_0035_0000$$$::"Thanks for waiting, I'm ready. This is gonna hurt a little, but don't worry[line2]what's wrong, Emiya?"::
55755::$$$message_0494_0036_0000$$$::"Oh. Tohsaka, this..."[lr]::
55756::$$$message_0494_0036_0001$$$::I hold out the photo I found.::
55757::$$$message_0494_0037_0000$$$::"Oh, this is an old picture. I left it in the corner. What about it?"[lr]::
55758::$$$message_0494_0037_0001$$$::"Um, well...it's nothing, really, but..."::
55759::$$$message_0494_0038_0000$$$::I hesitate to bring it up, since it doesn't matter.[lr]::
55760::$$$message_0494_0038_0001$$$::I really don't need to ask her this, but something about it stands out to me.::
55761::$$$message_0494_0039_0000$$$::"Oh, that. You noticed my ribbons are different."[lr]::
55762::$$$message_0494_0039_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55763::$$$message_0494_0039_0002$$$::I nod.::
55764::$$$message_0494_0040_0000$$$::"Well, of course they are. We girls have lots of accessories to keep our hair up. Do you think I wouldn't change my favorite ribbon after ten years?"::
55765::$$$message_0494_0041_0000$$$::Oh.[lr]::
55766::$$$message_0494_0041_0001$$$::That does make sense, now that she mentions it.[lr]::
55767::$$$message_0494_0041_0002$$$::What am I getting so hung up on some ribbon for?::
55768::$$$message_0494_0042_0000$$$::"Just kidding. I wish I could say that, but hair ties are special. Hair is a final trump card for female mages. Bindings are suitable as tools of magecraft, and there aren't a lot of things that can replace them."[lr]::
55769::$$$message_0494_0042_0001$$$::"Huh. So is your ribbon some kind of magical item?"::
55770::$$$message_0494_0043_0000$$$::"Yeah. Tying one's hair also means bottling up one's magical energy. The Tohsakas don't have Mystic Eyes, but we can at least store spare magical energy in our hair.[lr]::
55771::$$$message_0494_0043_0001$$$::So, since I control my body, it's best if I make my own hair ties."::
55772::$$$message_0494_0044_0000$$$::"That right there is the first ribbon I ever made. It was my favorite, but I had reasons to part with it.[lr]::
55773::$$$message_0494_0044_0001$$$::...Anyway, that's enough small talk. I'm going to start the consecration, so have a seat in this chair."::
