41316::$$$message_0361_0000_0000$$$::I go back to my room and lie down.[lr]::
41317::$$$message_0361_0000_0001$$$::Sleepiness spreads to my whole body as soon as I do.::
41318::$$$message_0361_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41319::$$$message_0361_0001_0001$$$::I stare at the dark ceiling.[lr]::
41320::$$$message_0361_0001_0002$$$::We are going to Illyasviel... That girl in white's hideout tomorrow.::
41321::$$$message_0361_0002_0000$$$::No matter what kind of negotiations take place, it's obvious that it'll become a trial of strength.[lr]::
41322::$$$message_0361_0002_0001$$$::Tohsaka suggested that we take a nap before we head over, since we won't be able to achieve good results if we go with tired bodies.::
41323::$$$message_0361_0003_0000$$$::"...Five more hours till dawn. We have to go talk to that girl after that."::
41324::$$$message_0361_0004_0000$$$::The young Master that appeared in front of us on the night I became a Master.[lr]::
41325::$$$message_0361_0004_0001$$$::If Saber is an excellent Servant in all aspects,[lr]::
41326::$$$message_0361_0004_0002$$$::then Berserker is specialized when it comes to battle.[lr]::
41327::$$$message_0361_0004_0003$$$::There's no Servant that can match Berserker simply in terms of battle. ::
41328::$$$message_0361_0005_0000$$$::"...How are we supposed to talk with such monsters?"[lr]::
41329::$$$message_0361_0005_0001$$$::Saying it makes me believe that it's impossible to negotiate with them.[lr]::
41330::$$$message_0361_0005_0002$$$::However...::
41331::$$$message_0361_0006_0000$$$::Strangely, I don't feel any uneasiness.[lr]::
41332::$$$message_0361_0006_0001$$$::I feel like that Illya kid will understand if we talk to her.[lr]::
41333::$$$message_0361_0006_0002$$$::...Just like Tohsaka, I'm sure she can differentiate her enemies and allies as a mage, but I feel like she's a decent kid in a different regard.::
41334::$$$message_0361_0007_0000$$$::"...Geez, what wishful thinking when I haven't even talked with her yet."[lr]::
41335::$$$message_0361_0007_0001$$$::I bet she would flame me, saying that it's a convenient fantasy.[lr]::
41336::$$$message_0361_0007_0002$$$::But, what's wrong with believing that?[lr]::
41337::$$$message_0361_0007_0003$$$::Is it weird to have hope for someone who you don't know and are about to meet?::
41338::$$$message_0361_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41339::$$$message_0361_0008_0001$$$::I realize that I'm gritting my teeth.[lr]::
41340::$$$message_0361_0008_0002$$$::The man that told me to drown in my ideals betrayed Tohsaka in front of my eyes.[lr]::
41341::$$$message_0361_0008_0003$$$::A guy with that much trust and power changed his beliefs that easily.::
41342::$$$message_0361_0009_0000$$$::"...Archer."[lr]::
41343::$$$message_0361_0009_0001$$$::I feel my heart start to sink.[lr]::
41344::$$$message_0361_0009_0002$$$::No, is it freezing?[lr]::
41345::$$$message_0361_0009_0003$$$::My mind freezes, just thinking back at his actions.::
41346::$$$message_0361_0010_0000$$$::I'm angry.[lr]::
41347::$$$message_0361_0010_0001$$$::I can't forgive him for betraying Tohsaka, out of all people.[lr]::
41348::$$$message_0361_0010_0002$$$::I can't forgive him for abandoning his ally, out of all people.[lr]::
41349::$$$message_0361_0010_0003$$$::I... Will never be like that.[lr]::
41350::$$$message_0361_0010_0004$$$::Even if that had been the very best action to survive and it ends up being the correct path, I will never do something like that. ::
41351::$$$message_0361_0011_0000$$$::His actions have been getting on my nerves.[lr]::
41352::$$$message_0361_0011_0001$$$::He told me not to talk about ideals.[lr]::
41353::$$$message_0361_0011_0002$$$::I rebelled against him when he said that I can't save everything.[lr]::
41354::$$$message_0361_0011_0003$$$::Even then... I agreed somewhere in my heart.::
41355::$$$message_0361_0012_0000$$$::...His words are correct.[lr]::
41356::$$$message_0361_0012_0001$$$::The hero of justice that my old man talked about was just a pipe dream,[lr]::
41357::$$$message_0361_0012_0002$$$::and I accepted the fact that I have to become like him if I wanted to get as close to that ideal as possible.[lr]::
41358::$$$message_0361_0012_0003$$$::I've been denying it, even though I had accepted it in my mind.::
41359::$$$message_0361_0013_0000$$$::...But, this time isn't that kind of level.[lr]::
41360::$$$message_0361_0013_0001$$$::I can't accept him.[lr]::
41361::$$$message_0361_0013_0002$$$::I can't accept the action that he took no matter the circumstances.[lr]::
41362::$$$message_0361_0013_0003$$$::I won't be able to keep standing if I approve of it.::
41363::$$$message_0361_0014_0000$$$::"...That's why I can't lose to you."[lr]::
41364::$$$message_0361_0014_0001$$$::...My words don't disperse into the night and remain in the room.[lr]::
41365::$$$message_0361_0014_0002$$$::A few more hours until dawn.[lr]::
41366::$$$message_0361_0014_0003$$$::I keep repeating those words in my mud-like slumber...::
