73509::$$$message_0674_0000_0000$$$::"...Huh? Did Shirou just go outside...?"[lr]::
73510::$$$message_0674_0000_0001$$$::The noise from the front door makes Rin Tohsaka look up in surprise.[lr]::
73511::$$$message_0674_0000_0002$$$::Peering through the window, she can indeed see someone running off in the street.::
73512::$$$message_0674_0001_0000$$$::"That moron! He didn't listen to a word I said about resting!"[lr]::
73513::$$$message_0674_0001_0001$$$::She stops mixing the drug and stands up in a hurry.[lr]::
73514::$$$message_0674_0001_0002$$$::It's important to have Sakura Matou drink this, but the priority now is to stop Shirou.::
73515::$$$message_0674_0002_0000$$$::"This is even worse than talking to a wall! He has no idea how weak he is right now...!"[lr]::
73516::$$$message_0674_0002_0001$$$::She goes down the stairs.[lr]::
73517::$$$message_0674_0002_0002$$$::She needs to hurry out the front door and chase after Shirou.::
73518::$$$message_0674_0003_0000$$$::"Oh, but first..."[lr]::
73519::$$$message_0674_0003_0001$$$::She should warn Sakura before she leaves, just in case.[lr]::
73520::$$$message_0674_0003_0002$$$::At first she was going to take the drug with her, but she still hasn't given Sakura the water pitcher and pajamas, nor taken her temperature.[lr]::
73521::$$$message_0674_0003_0003$$$::Shirou's recklessness is irritating, but she won't be in any position to scold Shirou if she neglects Sakura.::
73522::$$$message_0674_0004_0000$$$::"I can tell she's sleeping from here, though."[lr]::
73523::$$$message_0674_0004_0001$$$::It's only been about a minute.[lr]::
73524::$$$message_0674_0004_0002$$$::Shirou's bound to run out of breath and stop halfway down the hill. He can't run a kilometer in his condition.::
73525::$$$message_0674_0005_0000$$$::"...And he calls me dangerous? You're the biggest danger because you're so clueless, dummy."[lr]::
73526::$$$message_0674_0005_0001$$$::Anyway, she needs to catch up to him right away.[lr]::
73527::$$$message_0674_0005_0002$$$::Right now, she's the most able person in the Emiya household.[lr]::
73528::$$$message_0674_0005_0003$$$::It's only responsible of her to spend her extra energy taking care of her exhausted friends.::
73529::$$$message_0674_0006_0000$$$::"Sakura, I'm coming in."[lr]::
73530::$$$message_0674_0006_0001$$$::She goes into the room without waiting for an answer.[lr]::
73531::$$$message_0674_0006_0002$$$::"I'm stepping out for a bit. I'll be right back, so behave. I'll leave a change of clothes here[line2]"[lr]::
73532::$$$message_0674_0006_0003$$$::She stops before[lr]::
73533::$$$message_0674_0006_0004$$$::she can finish her sentence.[lr]::
73534::$$$message_0674_0006_0005$$$::"...All right. You sure got me, Sakura."[lr]::
73535::$$$message_0674_0006_0006$$$::Rin punches the wall so hard she might break it.::
73536::$$$message_0674_0007_0000$$$::   Sakura isn't in her bedroom.[lr]::
73537::$$$message_0674_0007_0001$$$::Someone else is lying in the bed.::
73538::$$$message_0674_0008_0000$$$::"...How despicable, Rider. A Servant pretending to be her Master in bed?"[lr]::
73539::$$$message_0674_0008_0001$$$::"I don't like it either, but it was an order.[lr]::
73540::$$$message_0674_0008_0002$$$::This is due to your carelessness, so I'd appreciate you not taking it out on me."[lr]::
73541::$$$message_0674_0008_0003$$$::"...You've got some nerve saying that, when this is completely on her."[lr]::
73542::$$$message_0674_0008_0004$$$::She audibly grinds her teeth.[lr]::
73543::$$$message_0674_0008_0005$$$::Her hostile glare slides off Rider's serene attitude.::
73544::$$$message_0674_0009_0000$$$::"Rin Tohsaka. If there is a next time, you should set a better lookout. A kingfisher familiar cannot fool Sakura. She may not be your equal in skill, but her instincts are just as sharp."[lr]::
73545::$$$message_0674_0009_0001$$$::"Right. Thanks for the warning... Though this sounds like more than just a warning, given the situation."::
73546::$$$message_0674_0010_0000$$$::"Of course. Sakura told me not to let you leave until she came back."[lr]::
73547::$$$message_0674_0010_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
73548::$$$message_0674_0010_0002$$$::She clicks her tongue in the dimness.[lr]::
73549::$$$message_0674_0010_0003$$$::There's nothing she can do now.[lr]::
73550::$$$message_0674_0010_0004$$$::Rin can't defeat or escape from Rider on her own.[lr]::
73551::$$$message_0674_0010_0005$$$::All she can do is stay as Sakura wants.::
73552::$$$message_0674_0011_0000$$$::"I'm so annoyed. I was trying to help him because he can't do this on his own, but he's going to end up trying anyway."[lr]::
73553::$$$message_0674_0011_0001$$$::"You aren't going to resist? How gracious, if unexpected."[lr]::
73554::$$$message_0674_0011_0002$$$::"I just need to not leave the house, right? I can't beat you, so I'll wait here until Sakura comes home."[lr]::
73555::$$$message_0674_0011_0003$$$::Rin makes a show of sighing and leans against the wall.::
73556::$$$message_0674_0012_0000$$$::She doesn't feel like fighting right now.[lr]::
73557::$$$message_0674_0012_0001$$$::Her shoulders go slack, and she looks down.[lr]::
73558::$$$message_0674_0012_0002$$$::"You know, Rider, she's never coming back... Even if she does, she won't be the Sakura Matou we know anymore."[lr]::
73559::$$$message_0674_0012_0003$$$::The mage's icy voice prophesies a terrible future.:¸á
