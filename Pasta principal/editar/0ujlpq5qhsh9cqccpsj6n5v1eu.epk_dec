61268::$$$message_0562_0000_0000$$$::"Oh, come to think of it..."[lr]::
61269::$$$message_0562_0000_0001$$$::I forgot after all the confusion this morning, but I have a promise to keep to Illya.[lr]::
61270::$$$message_0562_0000_0002$$$::...Okay, it wasn't exactly a promise, but I'm the one who asked if I could see her again, so it would be really rude not to wait at the park for her.::
61271::$$$message_0562_0001_0000$$$::"Saber and Sakura are..."[lr]::
61272::$$$message_0562_0001_0001$$$::Getting along just fine doing dishes.[lr]::
61273::$$$message_0562_0001_0002$$$::If I tell them I'm stepping out, they'll either stop me or try to come with me.::
61274::$$$message_0562_0002_0000$$$::It's better if I go meet Illya alone.[lr]::
61275::$$$message_0562_0002_0001$$$::I'm sorry to Saber and Sakura, but I'll just leave a note and sneak out...::
61276::$$$message_0562_0003_0000$$$::"Phew."[lr]::
61277::$$$message_0562_0003_0001$$$::Somehow, I left without them noticing.[lr]::
61278::$$$message_0562_0003_0002$$$::I did leave a note saying, "Picking up food for dinner, back in an hour," so they shouldn't be too surprised.::
61279::$$$message_0562_0004_0000$$$::"Guess...Illya isn't here."[lr]::
61280::$$$message_0562_0004_0001$$$::There's nobody at the park.[lr]::
61281::$$$message_0562_0004_0002$$$::The small park surrounded by apartment buildings feels forlorn, and it's so chilly, it feels as if it could get thoroughly covered in snow soon.::
61282::$$$message_0562_0005_0000$$$::"...Well, I wouldn't know what to talk about even if she was here."[lr]::
61283::$$$message_0562_0005_0001$$$::I sit down on a bench.[lr]::
61284::$$$message_0562_0005_0002$$$::I set the plastic bag I'm holding on the ground, and look up at the overcast sky.[lr]::
61285::$$$message_0562_0005_0003$$$::Looks like the small souvenir I bought from the shopping district was a waste.::
61286::$$$message_0562_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
61287::$$$message_0562_0006_0001$$$::I absently gaze up at the clouds.[lr]::
61288::$$$message_0562_0006_0002$$$::Maybe it's because of all the buildings around.[lr]::
61289::$$$message_0562_0006_0003$$$::From here, the sky looks boxed off and more distant than usual.::
61290::$$$message_0562_0007_0000$$$::"...It's cold."[lr]::
61291::$$$message_0562_0007_0001$$$::My breath mists white.[lr]::
61292::$$$message_0562_0007_0002$$$::The cold, dry air is freezing, and I wouldn't be surprised if it started snowing.::
61293::$$$message_0562_0008_0000$$$::"Guess I'll go home, then."[lr]::
61294::$$$message_0562_0008_0001$$$::I pick up the plastic bag and stand up from the bench.[lr]::
61295::$$$message_0562_0008_0002$$$::It's after 2:00 PM.[lr]::
61296::$$$message_0562_0008_0003$$$::If I don't get back soon, they'll know I was lying.::
61297::$$$message_0562_0009_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
61298::$$$message_0562_0009_0001$$$::My legs freeze.[lr]::
61299::$$$message_0562_0009_0002$$$::I can't move them.[lr]::
61300::$$$message_0562_0009_0003$$$::No matter how hard I try, they just stay in place.::
61301::$$$message_0562_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
61302::$$$message_0562_0010_0001$$$::The world distorts.[lr]::
61303::$$$message_0562_0010_0002$$$::No, that's not what's happening.[lr]::
61304::$$$message_0562_0010_0003$$$::My vision is broken.[lr]::
61305::$$$message_0562_0010_0004$$$::My eyeballs sink into my skull, and I lose any sense of distance from my surroundings.::
61306::$$$message_0562_0011_0000$$$::"Ngh...ah..."[lr]::
61307::$$$message_0562_0011_0001$$$::I finally realize that I'm in the worst possible situation.[lr]::
61308::$$$message_0562_0011_0002$$$::It's like my insides have turned to stone.[lr]::
61309::$$$message_0562_0011_0003$$$::My nerves are severed, and my vision feels cut off from the world.[lr]::
61310::$$$message_0562_0011_0004$$$::It's like looking at the world through a camera. I've become the protagonist of a video game, controlled by a joystick, and it makes me feel sick.::
61311::$$$message_0562_0012_0000$$$::"Sa...ber..."[lr]::
61312::$$$message_0562_0012_0001$$$::I'm going to be killed.[lr]::
61313::$$$message_0562_0012_0002$$$::Was it a mistake to go out on my own?::
61314::$$$message_0562_0013_0000$$$::Is this how I go out, unable to resist, not even knowing who did it[line2][lr]::
61315::$$$message_0562_0013_0001$$$::"Just kidding! Did I surprise you?[lr]::
61316::$$$message_0562_0013_0002$$$::You're so vulnerable, Shirou. I thought it would be funny to tease you a little."[lr]::
61317::$$$message_0562_0013_0003$$$::   So this little prankster has been toying with me?::
61318::$$$message_0562_0014_0000$$$::"Ah, you're back. I guess you bounced back because I only touched you through your vision."[lr]::
61319::$$$message_0562_0014_0001$$$::"Ow..."::
61320::$$$message_0562_0015_0000$$$::She pops out from behind me.[lr]::
61321::$$$message_0562_0015_0001$$$::Illya smiles smugly, as if she's been here the whole time at the park, watching me from behind.::
61322::$$$message_0562_0016_0000$$$::"You've still got a lot to learn if you haven't learned to dispel curses using only your internal world. If you need outside intervention to return to yourself, then your prospects in this war are pretty grim."[lr]::
61323::$$$message_0562_0016_0001$$$::She lectures me haughtily.[lr]::
61324::$$$message_0562_0016_0002$$$::Of course, the joke goes over my head.::
61325::$$$message_0562_0017_0000$$$::"Illya! What was that for!? Even if we're both Masters, sneak attacks aren't fair!"::
61326::$$$message_0562_0018_0000$$$::"That wasn't a sneak attack. I've been right next to you for a while, but you never noticed, and you even tried to go home. You brought this on yourself, Shirou."[lr]::
61327::$$$message_0562_0018_0001$$$::"Y-you were right next to me?"::
61328::$$$message_0562_0019_0000$$$::"Yeah, I was hiding. But you were still too careless. You couldn't detect me, and all I had to do was clash our magical energies to bind you in a curse. You're a Master, so you need to pay more attention to what's going on around you."[lr]::
61329::$$$message_0562_0019_0001$$$::Illya scolds me in exasperation.::
61330::$$$message_0562_0020_0000$$$::"Oh. Okay. I see."[lr]::
61331::$$$message_0562_0020_0001$$$::It makes her feel like a teacher, and I end up nodding obediently.::
61332::$$$message_0562_0021_0000$$$::"I'm glad you understand.[lr]::
61333::$$$message_0562_0021_0001$$$::So why are you here today, Shirou? You're all empty inside, and you didn't bring Saber with you. Wouldn't it be safer to rest at home?"::
61334::$$$message_0562_0022_0000$$$::"Huh? No, I didn't come to the park to rest.[lr]::
61335::$$$message_0562_0022_0001$$$::...Though, yeah, it was careless not to bring Saber."::
61336::$$$message_0562_0023_0000$$$::"Right? You were acting so weird, I couldn't leave you alone. Yesterday was the last day I was supposed to talk to you, but I'll make an exception."[lr]::
61337::$$$message_0562_0023_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
61338::$$$message_0562_0023_0002$$$::Illya says something strange.[lr]::
61339::$$$message_0562_0023_0003$$$::After all, I'm only here because...::
61340::$$$message_0562_0024_0000$$$::"So why were you sitting here?[lr]::
61341::$$$message_0562_0024_0001$$$::If I'd come as a Master, you'd already be dead, you know."[lr]::
61342::$$$message_0562_0024_0002$$$::"I just came to see you, Illya.[lr]::
61343::$$$message_0562_0024_0003$$$::Yesterday, you're the one who said we could see each other again."::
61344::$$$message_0562_0025_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
61345::$$$message_0562_0025_0001$$$::She's surprised.[lr]::
61346::$$$message_0562_0025_0002$$$::...It's not like we promised to meet, so that's to be expected.::
61347::$$$message_0562_0026_0000$$$::"Why...? I said I was going to kill you, Shirou. Why would you want to see me?"[lr]::
61348::$$$message_0562_0026_0001$$$::"That's your business, not mine. I want to talk to the Illya who isn't a Master, and..."::
61349::$$$message_0562_0027_0000$$$::Illya had a chance to kill me, and she didn't.[lr]::
61350::$$$message_0562_0027_0001$$$::If she'd let the curse keep going, I probably would have died.[lr]::
61351::$$$message_0562_0027_0002$$$::But she didn't let that happen, so I don't want to fight her.::
61352::$$$message_0562_0028_0000$$$::"Masters aren't supposed to fight in broad daylight, anyway.[lr]::
61353::$$$message_0562_0028_0001$$$::So let's forget about that for now. I'm just here to see you, Illya. Would you rather talk to me, or kill me?"::
61354::$$$message_0562_0029_0000$$$::"Eh!? I-I don't know. I want to do both. It's fun talking to you, but I'm not supposed to. I have to choose one."::
61355::$$$message_0562_0030_0000$$$::Illya mumbles, looking downcast.[lr]::
61356::$$$message_0562_0030_0001$$$::Her expression is so sincere, it looks more like she's suffering rather than indecisive.::
61357::$$$message_0562_0031_0000$$$::"...All right. Then you can pick either one. I won't tell you what to do."[lr]::
61358::$$$message_0562_0031_0001$$$::"Ah... B-but I..."[lr]::
61359::$$$message_0562_0031_0002$$$::"Yeah, I know. Since we're here anyway, let's talk.[lr]::
61360::$$$message_0562_0031_0003$$$::I brought you a gift, so we can fight next time."::
61361::$$$message_0562_0032_0000$$$::I take a paper bag of taiyaki out of the plastic bag.[lr]::
61362::$$$message_0562_0032_0001$$$::It cooled while I was waiting for Illya, but it's still faintly warm.::
61363::$$$message_0562_0033_0000$$$::"Your present. I hope you'll let me off the hook today."[lr]::
61364::$$$message_0562_0033_0001$$$::I push the taiyaki into her hands.[lr]::
61365::$$$message_0562_0033_0002$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
61366::$$$message_0562_0033_0003$$$::Illya hesitates, but still takes the taiyaki without saying anything. She gives me a small nod.::
61367::$$$message_0562_0034_0000$$$::I don't really remember what we talked about after that.[lr]::
61368::$$$message_0562_0034_0001$$$::Foods we like and dislike.[lr]::
61369::$$$message_0562_0034_0002$$$::She likes birds and dislikes cats. She likes snow but doesn't like the cold. She wants to play, but she can't. She doesn't like the nagging maid who keeps an eye on her, but could come to like her. Just silly stuff like that.::
61370::$$$message_0562_0035_0000$$$::Illya seems happy just to have someone to talk to.[lr]::
61371::$$$message_0562_0035_0001$$$::She stuffs her cheeks with the barely warm taiyaki and kicks her feet while sitting on the bench.[lr]::
61372::$$$message_0562_0035_0002$$$::...It brings to mind the image of a daughter waiting for her father to come home.::
61373::$$$message_0562_0036_0000$$$::"Wow. So you didn't come here by yourself?"[lr]::
61374::$$$message_0562_0036_0001$$$::"Sella and Leysritt came with me. I don't need anyone to keep an eye on me, but I do need someone to keep my affairs in order."::
61375::$$$message_0562_0037_0000$$$::Illya brought her two maids all the way to Japan.[lr]::
61376::$$$message_0562_0037_0001$$$::I understand that much, but is she having them stay in a hotel with her?::
61377::$$$message_0562_0038_0000$$$::"Hm? Are you curious about where I live?"[lr]::
61378::$$$message_0562_0038_0001$$$::"Er... yeah, I am. You always show up out of nowhere. I wouldn't know where to find you if I needed to."::
61379::$$$message_0562_0039_0000$$$::If Illya ever gets hurt or calls for help, I won't know where to find her.[lr]::
61380::$$$message_0562_0039_0001$$$::If she could at least tell me an address, then I'd feel a little better about it, but...::
61381::$$$message_0562_0040_0000$$$::"Okay, sure. You're special, Shirou. I'll tell you if you want to know."[lr]::
61382::$$$message_0562_0040_0001$$$::She agrees.[lr]::
61383::$$$message_0562_0040_0002$$$::Illya lightly gets up from the bench, and puts her hand on my forehead.::
61384::$$$message_0562_0041_0000$$$::"Whoa[line2]wait, Illya[line2]"[lr]::
61385::$$$message_0562_0041_0001$$$::"Just be quiet. If you resist too much, I'll send you into the wrong thing. Then it'll be a lot of trouble to bring you back."[lr]::
61386::$$$message_0562_0041_0002$$$::"Oh. O-okay."[lr]::
61387::$$$message_0562_0041_0003$$$::I reflexively nod at her stern tone.::
61388::$$$message_0562_0042_0000$$$::"Good boy. Now, close your eyes. Also, don't look around too much. I'm 'sending' you, but I'm actually only moving your viewpoint and not your body, so you might get motion sickness."::
61389::$$$message_0562_0043_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
61390::$$$message_0562_0043_0001$$$::Illya suddenly presses her forehead against mine.[lr]::
61391::$$$message_0562_0043_0002$$$::I close my eyes in surprise.[lr]::
61392::$$$message_0562_0043_0003$$$::    Suddenly,::
61393::$$$message_0562_0044_0000$$$::my field of view accelerates at extreme speed, then expands.[lr]::
61394::$$$message_0562_0044_0001$$$::No, it's my consciousness that expands.[lr]::
61395::$$$message_0562_0044_0002$$$::I find myself looking at a scene I've never seen, peering down from someplace high up...::
61396::$$$message_0562_0045_0000$$$::"[font italic=true]Can you see it? Right now, your sense of vision is connected to my forest.[font italic=false]"::
61397::$$$message_0562_0046_0000$$$::Illya's voice echoes.[lr]::
61398::$$$message_0562_0046_0001$$$::I can't answer or nod.[lr]::
61399::$$$message_0562_0046_0002$$$::Right now, I am only my sense of vision.[lr]::
61400::$$$message_0562_0046_0003$$$::I'm a tree, looking out over a vast forest.[lr]::
61401::$$$message_0562_0046_0004$$$::I can't move my body,[lr]::
61402::$$$message_0562_0046_0005$$$::because I've just been transformed into a silent tree.::
61403::$$$message_0562_0047_0000$$$::"[font italic=true]Remember the way? I'll send you to the castle walls next.[font italic=false]"::
61404::$$$message_0562_0048_0000$$$::The image changes.[lr]::
61405::$$$message_0562_0048_0001$$$::I'm cut off from my body, but my vision still works.[lr]::
61406::$$$message_0562_0048_0002$$$::   I'm still me, but I can't feel myself.::
61407::$$$message_0562_0049_0000$$$::After the tree comes a wall.[lr]::
61408::$$$message_0562_0049_0001$$$::I still feel my arms and legs, but I don't have any limbs to move. I feel like I have a body I can move, but I don't feel free to move.::
61409::$$$message_0562_0050_0000$$$::"Leysritt. I haven't seen Lady Illyasviel. Do you know where she might be?"[lr]::
61410::$$$message_0562_0050_0001$$$::"...No idea. Illya should be. Somewhere."[lr]::
61411::$$$message_0562_0050_0002$$$::"Leysritt, stop addressing our mistress that way. We serve [font italic=true]Lady Illyasviel[font italic=false]. Have you forgotten the duty that our lord charged us with?"::
61412::$$$message_0562_0051_0000$$$::"...Sella, you're Illya's tutor. My job is to help Illya put on the Third Dress[line2]the Heaven's Feel."[lr]::
61413::$$$message_0562_0051_0001$$$::"Correct. I'm glad that you remember even that, with your poor memory."[lr]::
61414::$$$message_0562_0051_0002$$$::"...I haven't...forgotten. Because Illya...doesn't like wearing it. I don't really want to. To make her wear it."::
61415::$$$message_0562_0052_0000$$$::"I'm well aware of that. But when the time comes, she must wear it. It is what we were created for.[lr]::
61416::$$$message_0562_0052_0001$$$::The mistress is determined to do her duty."::
61417::$$$message_0562_0053_0000$$$::"...Sella."[lr]::
61418::$$$message_0562_0053_0001$$$::"What is it, Leysritt?"[lr]::
61419::$$$message_0562_0053_0002$$$::"...Doesn't it make you tired?"[lr]::
61420::$$$message_0562_0053_0003$$$::"Not at all!"::
61421::$$$message_0562_0054_0000$$$::...I hear two maids with the same face and outfit talking.[lr]::
61422::$$$message_0562_0054_0001$$$::As soon as I realize they're the caretakers Illya mentioned,::
61423::$$$message_0562_0055_0000$$$::I finally return to my body.::
61424::$$$message_0562_0056_0000$$$::"Well done. How was it? That was a bit of Metamorphosis magecraft."[lr]::
61425::$$$message_0562_0056_0001$$$::"Agh... Oof."::
61426::$$$message_0562_0057_0000$$$::I put my hand over my mouth and fight down the nausea.[lr]::
61427::$$$message_0562_0057_0001$$$::Everything suddenly became more real when the images suddenly became my own again, and it makes me feel sick.::
61428::$$$message_0562_0058_0000$$$::"Ill...ya... What was that?"[lr]::
61429::$$$message_0562_0058_0001$$$::"I transferred your consciousness. I sent your sense of vision into something else."::
61430::$$$message_0562_0059_0000$$$::"Your eyeballs are connected to your brain by nerves, right? I connected your brain to something else instead of your eyeballs.[lr]::
61431::$$$message_0562_0059_0001$$$::For a few moments, your visual information didn't come from your eyeballs, but from the trees in my forest."::
61432::$$$message_0562_0060_0000$$$::"...Mrgh. So I didn't turn into a tree, but I was receiving a transmission of what the tree saw, making me think that I was the tree?"::
61433::$$$message_0562_0061_0000$$$::"Oh, you're sharper than you look.[lr]::
61434::$$$message_0562_0061_0001$$$::Yeah, that's what happened. It's a form of magecraft that treats humans like hardware and transposes their input source.[lr]::
61435::$$$message_0562_0061_0002$$$::It's a big deal to turn someone directly into a tree, but magecraft is still capable of connecting someone's consciousness to a tree. This magecraft is used for scrying and possession, too."::
61436::$$$message_0562_0062_0000$$$::"...I think I get it. But that's crazy. When I was seeing from the tree's point of view, I couldn't do anything. Can't you use this transference to attack someone and render them helpless?"::
61437::$$$message_0562_0063_0000$$$::"Yes. Our magical attribute is the flow and transference of power.[lr]::
61438::$$$message_0562_0063_0001$$$::For example, the Tohsaka mages transfer their energy into precious gems, which maintains the power's purity. They can apply the same logic to transfer someone's consciousness by force, too.[lr]::
61439::$$$message_0562_0063_0002$$$::If there's an enemy they want to seal away, they can neutralize the target by designating the consciousness' input as the inside of a jewel, or a puppet that can't move."::
61440::$$$message_0562_0064_0000$$$::"But transferring someone else's consciousness has a very low success rate, so I'd say most mages wouldn't use it offensively, unless they're specialists like me or the Tohsakas."::
61441::$$$message_0562_0065_0000$$$::"It worked on you because you didn't resist, and because the forest belongs to me. It's normally a lot harder to make the connection work."::
61442::$$$message_0562_0066_0000$$$::"On top of that, if the transferee's source body receives any stimulus before the transfer is done, their consciousness will be forced back home.[lr]::
61443::$$$message_0562_0066_0001$$$::Even if the remote consciousness can't tell if its original body is in danger, the physical body will recall its separated consciousness if it senses danger."::
61444::$$$message_0562_0067_0000$$$::"That's what happened earlier, Shirou.[lr]::
61445::$$$message_0562_0067_0001$$$::You couldn't do anything when your mind was in that tree, but all I had to do was shake you to make it call your soul back."::
61446::$$$message_0562_0068_0000$$$::"...Hm. So it's like a dream?"[lr]::
61447::$$$message_0562_0068_0001$$$::When I dream, I can't wake up on my own no matter how hard I try.[lr]::
61448::$$$message_0562_0068_0002$$$::Most of the time, I wake up when morning arrives.[lr]::
61449::$$$message_0562_0068_0003$$$::In other words, my body's habitual functions wake me up.::
61450::$$$message_0562_0069_0000$$$::"Mmm, I'd say it's a little different. You can awaken from a dream using your own intellect.[lr]::
61451::$$$message_0562_0069_0001$$$::That's why transference isn't suited to offensive use. It's mainly used for self-preservation."::
61452::$$$message_0562_0070_0000$$$::"If you transfer your own consciousness to a familiar or a puppet that can move, you can control that body and use it to safely conduct magical work."::
61453::$$$message_0562_0071_0000$$$::"...So you're saying that even if an enemy defeats your remote-controlled robot familiar, your consciousness will just return to your real body?"::
61454::$$$message_0562_0072_0000$$$::"Yeah. A mage who transfers their own consciousness will make absolutely certain to hide their real body in a safe place.[lr]::
61455::$$$message_0562_0072_0001$$$::In that case, they also need to be careful if the target familiar has a soul of its own."::
61456::$$$message_0562_0073_0000$$$::"If the target vessel has its own command system[line2]its own mind, then the mind of the familiar with a soul will be in control."::
61457::$$$message_0562_0074_0000$$$::"That's why when we transfer into a human or an animal, we just end up on the edge of the target's brain. We're only looking at images along with them. It isn't remote control, but remote viewing through a camera."::
61458::$$$message_0562_0075_0000$$$::"To move your own mind into a living being[line2]a familiar with a soul[line2]and dominate them isn't transference, but magecraft on the level of reincarnation.[lr]::
61459::$$$message_0562_0075_0001$$$::That's a form of grand magecraft which most mages can't hope to emulate."::
61460::$$$message_0562_0076_0000$$$::Reincarnation...[lr]::
61461::$$$message_0562_0076_0001$$$::Magecraft that lets a child inherit one's soul after death.[lr]::
61462::$$$message_0562_0076_0002$$$::Apparently, some mages have achieved it, but recreating the soul is a challenge of its own.::
61463::$$$message_0562_0077_0000$$$::One might manage to start life over as a baby, but if one doesn't inherit 100% of one's abilities from one's past life, that isn't reincarnation, but mere duplication.[lr]::
61464::$$$message_0562_0077_0001$$$::It's a replica. An inferior copy.[lr]::
61465::$$$message_0562_0077_0002$$$::The baby would be inferior to the mage it was reborn from.::
61466::$$$message_0562_0078_0000$$$::"If you're going to bother transferring into living things, you could make a mindless familiar and control that shell.[lr]::
61467::$$$message_0562_0078_0001$$$::But modern mages can't make very powerful soulless vessels. They're just stuffed dolls that the mage controls with their magical energy.[lr]::
61468::$$$message_0562_0078_0002$$$::They aren't good for much more than delivering messages."::
61469::$$$message_0562_0079_0000$$$::"Besides, even if you send your mind into a familiar or a moving puppet, it doesn't change the fact that your own mind will disappear once your real body dies of old age.[lr]::
61470::$$$message_0562_0079_0001$$$::It isn't a path to immortality."::
61471::$$$message_0562_0080_0000$$$::"Souls are the only permanent thing in the material world.[lr]::
61472::$$$message_0562_0080_0001$$$::But nobody can make souls exist independently in the world. A soul can't remain here without a body to host it, and once it acquires a body, it's bound by that body's mortality.[lr]::
61473::$$$message_0562_0080_0002$$$::The magecraft you just experienced is about the best we Einzberns and Tohsakas can manage."::
61474::$$$message_0562_0081_0000$$$::   The lecture ends.[lr]::
61475::$$$message_0562_0081_0001$$$::Suddenly, something rings out, announcing the time.[lr]::
61476::$$$message_0562_0081_0002$$$::The clock in the park reads 3:00 PM.[lr]::
61477::$$$message_0562_0081_0003$$$::An entire hour went by before I even knew it.::
61478::$$$message_0562_0082_0000$$$::"Ah...I have to go soon. Are you going home, Shirou?"[lr]::
61479::$$$message_0562_0082_0001$$$::"Hm? Yeah, I'd better get back soon too or I'll be in trouble."[lr]::
61480::$$$message_0562_0082_0002$$$::Illya nods, then walks into the middle of the park.::
61481::$$$message_0562_0083_0000$$$::"...Okay. I really shouldn't say this, but..."[lr]::
61482::$$$message_0562_0083_0001$$$::She pauses, as if expecting to be rejected.::
61483::$$$message_0562_0083_0002$$$::"Will you come see me tomorrow, too?"[lr]::
61484::$$$message_0562_0083_0003$$$::The small, white-haired girl asks me.::
61485::$$$message_0562_0084_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
61486::$$$message_0562_0084_0001$$$::...That idiot.[lr]::
61487::$$$message_0562_0084_0002$$$::Do I even need to answer that?::
61488::$$$message_0562_0085_0000$$$::"I'll be here tomorrow. Today you told me where you live, so it's my turn next."[lr]::
61489::$$$message_0562_0085_0001$$$::"Okay! Then it's a promise! I'll definitely call out to you tomorrow!"::
61490::$$$message_0562_0086_0000$$$::Illya leaves.[lr]::
61491::$$$message_0562_0086_0001$$$::The sky is gray.[lr]::
61492::$$$message_0562_0086_0002$$$::It makes the white-haired girl seem like a fairy.::
