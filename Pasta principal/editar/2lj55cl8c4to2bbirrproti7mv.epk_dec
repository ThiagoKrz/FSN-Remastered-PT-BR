39774::$$$message_0340_0000_0000$$$::We get off the bus.[lr]::
39775::$$$message_0340_0000_0001$$$::It's about to start raining right as we reach the usual intersection.::
39776::$$$message_0340_0001_0000$$$::"Did you have fun today?"[lr]::
39777::$$$message_0340_0001_0001$$$::Just as we got off the bus and were about to head to the hill...[lr]::
39778::$$$message_0340_0001_0002$$$::Tohsaka suddenly asks me that.::
39779::$$$message_0340_0002_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
39780::$$$message_0340_0002_0001$$$::I don't even need to answer.[lr]::
39781::$$$message_0340_0002_0002$$$::There's no doubt it was fun.[lr]::
39782::$$$message_0340_0002_0003$$$::It's like an extraordinary feat of strength, as if I was thrown into a washing machine and spun round.[lr]::
39783::$$$message_0340_0002_0004$$$::I feel like my nervousness and confusion were washed away along with the stains.[lr]::
39784::$$$message_0340_0002_0005$$$::But, that is...::
39785::$$$message_0340_0003_0000$$$::"Well? Was it fun, Shirou?"[lr]::
39786::$$$message_0340_0003_0001$$$::"Yeah, you got me. It's been a long time since I've hung out this much. Man, you really pulled me around everywhere."[lr]::
39787::$$$message_0340_0003_0002$$$::Um, the more fun it is...[lr]::
39788::$$$message_0340_0003_0003$$$::The more uncomfortable I get, feeling like I'm unworthy of such a thing.::
39789::$$$message_0340_0004_0000$$$:: "...I see. I don't know what's going on in your mind, but you should just honestly say it's fun if you're having fun. It's rude to the one who escorted you."::
39790::$$$message_0340_0005_0000$$$::"Huh...? No, that's not what I meant..."[lr]::
39791::$$$message_0340_0005_0001$$$::"Yes, it is. You're unconsciously putting the brakes on... Humph. I don't know what happened to you before, but if it's so painful, isn't it better to just forget about it?"::
39792::$$$message_0340_0006_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
39793::$$$message_0340_0006_0001$$$::...My breath stops.[lr]::
39794::$$$message_0340_0006_0002$$$::It's like she stuck a knife deep into my affected area with unexpected agility.::
39795::$$$message_0340_0007_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, that is..."[lr]::
39796::$$$message_0340_0007_0001$$$::"Now, it's none of my business. Well, I fulfilled my initial objective, so the rest is your problem."[lr]::
39797::$$$message_0340_0007_0002$$$::Tohsaka heads towards the hill, with her hair flowing in the wind.[lr]::
39798::$$$message_0340_0007_0003$$$::Not in the direction lined with Western-style houses, but the slope where the Japanese-style houses are.::
39799::$$$message_0340_0008_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
39800::$$$message_0340_0008_0001$$$::I stand there in a daze.[lr]::
39801::$$$message_0340_0008_0002$$$::"Shirou, are we not going home? It will start raining soon."[lr]::
39802::$$$message_0340_0008_0003$$$::"Y-Yeah. That's true, let's go."[lr]::
39803::$$$message_0340_0008_0004$$$::Being urged by Saber, I turn towards the hill.::
39804::$$$message_0340_0009_0000$$$::"...Wha..."[lr]::
39805::$$$message_0340_0009_0001$$$::As soon as I return home, I'm overwhelmed by a strong sense of discomfort.[lr]::
39806::$$$message_0340_0009_0002$$$::Nothing is missing, yet I feel a sense of loss like nothing is right.::
39807::$$$message_0340_0010_0000$$$::Both their faces stiffen. So does mine.[lr]::
39808::$$$message_0340_0010_0001$$$::The identity of this feeling.[lr]::
39809::$$$message_0340_0010_0002$$$::It's the same, yet the building is stripped of something important.[lr]::
39810::$$$message_0340_0010_0003$$$::The thing missing from the house is...::
39811::$$$message_0340_0011_0000$$$::"The Bounded Field is gone..."[lr]::
39812::$$$message_0340_0011_0001$$$::The Bounded Field that my old man set up.[lr]::
39813::$$$message_0340_0011_0002$$$::The Bounded Field that notifies us if something hostile intrudes, has been forcefully cut off‚Ä¶::
39814::$$$message_0340_0012_0000$$$::"...It seems like someone broke in while we were away... I guess it was fortunate we were out." ::
39815::$$$message_0340_0013_0000$$$::"Shirou, where is Taiga...!?"[lr]::
39816::$$$message_0340_0013_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39817::$$$message_0340_0013_0002$$$::After being astonished, I start running.[lr]::
39818::$$$message_0340_0013_0003$$$::There's no time to think.::
39819::$$$message_0340_0014_0000$$$::"Idio[line2]Wait...! The enemy might still be inside...!"::
39820::$$$message_0340_0015_0000$$$::    I hear a sound.[lr]::
39821::$$$message_0340_0015_0001$$$::I feel stagnation in the air once I open the door.[lr]::
39822::$$$message_0340_0015_0002$$$::The aftermath of someone intruding.[lr]::
39823::$$$message_0340_0015_0003$$$::The air is heavy like silk with a small amount of impurity in place of the Bounded Field.::
39824::$$$message_0340_0016_0000$$$::I run with my shoes still on.[lr]::
39825::$$$message_0340_0016_0001$$$::I have no time to take them off, or even think to do so.::
39826::$$$message_0340_0017_0000$$$::I enter the living room.[lr]::
39827::$$$message_0340_0017_0001$$$::The light isn't on.[lr]::
39828::$$$message_0340_0017_0002$$$::Under the gray sky, in the dark living room...[lr]::
39829::$$$message_0340_0017_0003$$$:: "Oh. I was just going to take her away, but you showed up at the right time, boy."[lr]::
39830::$$$message_0340_0017_0004$$$::There, was an unconscious Fuji-nee, and Caster, the enemy.::
39831::$$$message_0340_0018_0000$$$::"Caster...!"[lr]::
39832::$$$message_0340_0018_0001$$$::I hear Saber's voice behind me.[lr]::
39833::$$$message_0340_0018_0002$$$::The two rush over and stop, seeing Caster.[lr]::
39834::$$$message_0340_0018_0003$$$::It must be because Fuji-nee is being held hostage.[lr]::
39835::$$$message_0340_0018_0004$$$::If Saber and Tohsaka were to attack, Caster would cast a spell.::
39836::$$$message_0340_0019_0000$$$::It would be faster than any of us.[lr]::
39837::$$$message_0340_0019_0001$$$::Even if Saber were to charge forward,[lr]::
39838::$$$message_0340_0019_0002$$$::or Tohsaka were to cast a spell,[lr]::
39839::$$$message_0340_0019_0003$$$::Caster's fingertip would light up first.::
39840::$$$message_0340_0020_0000$$$::That position...[lr]::
39841::$$$message_0340_0020_0001$$$::If that happens, -----'s head will definitely splatter like a tomato.::
39842::$$$message_0340_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39843::$$$message_0340_0021_0001$$$::My mind freezes.[lr]::
39844::$$$message_0340_0021_0002$$$::I'm furious.[lr]::
39845::$$$message_0340_0021_0003$$$::My blood is boiling with anger, so much that my vision is about to turn red.[lr]::
39846::$$$message_0340_0021_0004$$$::Yet, my mind is awfully objective.[lr]::
39847::$$$message_0340_0021_0005$$$::I didn't know that you become calm once your anger surpasses a certain limit.::
39848::$$$message_0340_0022_0000$$$::"You're too careless, boy. If you are a mage, you need to put more effort into your Bounded Field."[lr]::
39849::$$$message_0340_0022_0001$$$::She snickers.[lr]::
39850::$$$message_0340_0022_0002$$$::I accept even that, as if it's happening to someone else.::
39851::$$$message_0340_0023_0000$$$::"What an admirable attitude, Caster. Did you come to our territory on your own to surrender?"[lr]::
39852::$$$message_0340_0023_0001$$$::Yes, I have similar business. However, it would be you people asking for forgiveness.::
39853::$$$message_0340_0024_0000$$$::Their voices are enough to create sparks between them.[lr]::
39854::$$$message_0340_0024_0001$$$::Tohsaka keeps glaring at Caster without doing anything.[lr]::
39855::$$$message_0340_0024_0002$$$::If she moves, ----- will die.[lr]::
39856::$$$message_0340_0024_0003$$$::If she were to move, then I'll ----- Tohsaka before Caster.::
39857::$$$message_0340_0025_0000$$$::"...So. What are you trying to do using that hostage?"[lr]::
39858::$$$message_0340_0025_0001$$$::"I do not have any business with you. I am interested in that boy."::
39859::$$$message_0340_0026_0000$$$::"Hey, do you remember the offer I made?"[lr]::
39860::$$$message_0340_0026_0001$$$::The incident at the temple.[lr]::
39861::$$$message_0340_0026_0002$$$::Caster told Archer and I to be her subordinates.::
39862::$$$message_0340_0027_0000$$$::"Ugh...! You're so persistent about it...!"[lr]::
39863::$$$message_0340_0027_0001$$$::Tohsaka's angry.[lr]::
39864::$$$message_0340_0027_0002$$$::...That's unexpected. Archer must've actually reported to Tohsaka.::
39865::$$$message_0340_0028_0000$$$::"Persistent? Yes, I usually would not be interested in a human who has refused already. But, that depends on the person, young lady."[lr]::
39866::$$$message_0340_0028_0001$$$::Caster is looking only at me.::
39867::$$$message_0340_0029_0000$$$::"You are interesting, boy. This is the fifth Holy Grail War, but I do not think a case like you has existed before.[lr]::
39868::$$$message_0340_0029_0001$$$::It is easy to kill you. But you are a valuable sample, so I would like to obtain you alive if possible.[lr]::
39869::$$$message_0340_0029_0002$$$::Do you understand? I am doing such an inelegant thing because I want you to be on my side alive."::
39870::$$$message_0340_0030_0000$$$::That means...[lr]::
39871::$$$message_0340_0030_0001$$$::If I refuse, she will k-ll -----.::
39872::$$$message_0340_0031_0000$$$::"I came here disobeying my Master. I am appraising you that much, so can you not feel my enthusiasm?"::
39873::$$$message_0340_0032_0000$$$::"Stop saying selfish things...! You're just doing whatever you like without obeying your Master...!"::
39874::$$$message_0340_0033_0000$$$::"Oh, are you jealous? But that's too bad. I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in you. You seem to be skilled as a Master, but you are nowhere near my level. What I want is not complete omnipotence, but an incomplete unique ability.[lr]::
39875::$$$message_0340_0033_0001$$$::...In that regard, that boy is ideal. He is an amateur mage, so it shall be easy to control him."::
39876::$$$message_0340_0034_0000$$$::A charming, derisive laughter.[lr]::
39877::$$$message_0340_0034_0001$$$::Caster presses for my answer while digging her fingers into the back of -----'s neck.::
39878::$$$message_0340_0035_0000$$$::"...How troubling. You should not need to think about it.[lr]::
39879::$$$message_0340_0035_0001$$$::Nobody other than me will obtain the Holy Grail. This town is already mine. No matter how skilled Saber may be, she cannot defeat me as I have an inexhaustible supply of magical energy."::
39880::$$$message_0340_0036_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39881::$$$message_0340_0036_0001$$$::Saber's presence moves.[lr]::
39882::$$$message_0340_0036_0002$$$::She's ready for war. She would immediately charge at Caster if she sees an opening.::
39883::$$$message_0340_0037_0000$$$::"...Heh. I am telling you it is useless, Saber.[lr]::
39884::$$$message_0340_0037_0001$$$::The nice thing is that it is only my shadow here doing this.[lr]::
39885::$$$message_0340_0037_0002$$$::The source of my power supply is every person living in this town. It is like having a thousand Masters.[lr]::
39886::$$$message_0340_0037_0003$$$::Do you understand what that means?"::
39887::$$$message_0340_0038_0000$$$::"Ugh... No way, you..."[lr]::
39888::$$$message_0340_0038_0001$$$::"Yes, even if humans don't have magical energy, their souls themselves are something entirely different, right?[lr]::
39889::$$$message_0340_0038_0002$$$::We are soul eaters to begin with. If we take away the magical energy called "life" from our Master, then we can get as much magical energy as we want.[lr]::
39890::$$$message_0340_0038_0003$$$::...I can even use your monstrous Noble Phantasm as many times as I want now."::
39891::$$$message_0340_0039_0000$$$::An almost inexhaustible source of supply.[lr]::
39892::$$$message_0340_0039_0001$$$::Magical energy sucked out from the people in the city.[lr]::
39893::$$$message_0340_0039_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...Is she saying she will win because she has that?[font italic=false][lr]::
39894::$$$message_0340_0039_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...Is she boasting that she's invincible because she uses innocent people like -----?[font italic=false][lr]::
39895::$$$message_0340_0039_0004$$$::It's the same as that time.[lr]::
39896::$$$message_0340_0039_0005$$$::She is still laughing while sacrificing others...?::
39897::$$$message_0340_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39898::$$$message_0340_0040_0001$$$::The firing hammer rises.[lr]::
39899::$$$message_0340_0040_0002$$$::Heat returns to my mind that was frozen from being too objective.::
39900::$$$message_0340_0041_0000$$$::"Now, let me hear your answer, Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
39901::$$$message_0340_0041_0001$$$::You have no chance at winning. Will you obey me along with Saber?"::
39902::$$$message_0340_0042_0000$$$::"...Let go of Fuji-nee."::
39903::$$$message_0340_0043_0000$$$::"...Were you not listening to what I was saying? I told you to come under my control."::
39904::$$$message_0340_0044_0000$$$::"Shut up. Let go of Fuji-nee."[lr]::
39905::$$$message_0340_0044_0001$$$::There is nothing else.[lr]::
39906::$$$message_0340_0044_0002$$$::I don't have a single thing to hand her.::
39907::$$$message_0340_0045_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39908::$$$message_0340_0045_0001$$$::A grinding sound.[lr]::
39909::$$$message_0340_0045_0002$$$::After Caster grits her teeth in irritation, she sighs as if to calm herself down.::
39910::$$$message_0340_0046_0000$$$::"...I understand. So the negotiation is broken off. Only one Master can obtain the Holy Grail. So you have no intention of cooperating with another Master?"::
39911::$$$message_0340_0047_0000$$$::"No, this has nothing to do with the Holy Grail. I just won't cooperate with you."[lr]::
39912::$$$message_0340_0047_0001$$$::"I see. I must really be despised."[lr]::
39913::$$$message_0340_0047_0002$$$::There is no contempt in her quiet voice.[lr]::
39914::$$$message_0340_0047_0003$$$::In return, it is only filled with anger.::
39915::$$$message_0340_0048_0000$$$::"...That is very unfortunate. Especially since I genuinely liked you.[lr]::
39916::$$$message_0340_0048_0001$$$::If you had cooperated with me, I could have shared the Holy Grail with you."::
39917::$$$message_0340_0049_0000$$$::"That's unnecessary. I decided to fight so that I can stop people like you. The Holy Grail has nothing to do with this.[lr]::
39918::$$$message_0340_0049_0001$$$::More importantly, let go of Fuji-nee."::
39919::$$$message_0340_0050_0000$$$::I glare at Caster.[lr]::
39920::$$$message_0340_0050_0001$$$::Receiving my stare filled with enmity, Caster...[lr]::
39921::$$$message_0340_0050_0002$$$::"Hehe... Haha, hahahahahaha!"[lr]::
39922::$$$message_0340_0050_0003$$$::She laughs as if it's funny for some reason.::
39923::$$$message_0340_0051_0000$$$::"...You..."[lr]::
39924::$$$message_0340_0051_0001$$$::"Oh, did I get on your nerves? But it's your fault too, since you said something you do not actually mean."[lr]::
39925::$$$message_0340_0051_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39926::$$$message_0340_0051_0003$$$::I never said anything I don't mean...::
39927::$$$message_0340_0052_0000$$$::"The Holy Grail has nothing to do this? Hehe, is that really so? You are a victim of the Holy Grail.[lr]::
39928::$$$message_0340_0052_0001$$$::By saying that the Holy Grail has nothing to do with this... Doesn't that mean you detest the Holy Grail?"[lr]::
39929::$$$message_0340_0052_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39930::$$$message_0340_0052_0003$$$::For a moment...[lr]::
39931::$$$message_0340_0052_0004$$$::My heart froze.::
39932::$$$message_0340_0053_0000$$$::"...Shirou?"[lr]::
39933::$$$message_0340_0053_0001$$$::I'm frozen and can't understand anything.[lr]::
39934::$$$message_0340_0053_0002$$$::Not even Tohsaka's eyes that look at me with worry, nor Saber's face that's lowered in pain.[lr]::
39935::$$$message_0340_0053_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39936::$$$message_0340_0053_0004$$$::Not even the extremely unpleasant nausea that rises up to my throat.::
39937::$$$message_0340_0054_0000$$$::"I know, Shirou Emiya. The previous war was ten years ago, right? You lost everything then. You were left alone in the flames, awaiting death, and Kiritsugu Emiya found you. [lr]::
39938::$$$message_0340_0054_0001$$$::Therefore, you are not actually a child from this household.[lr]::
39939::$$$message_0340_0054_0002$$$::Yet, you were forced to become a mage against your will, and you have suffered all this time, right?"::
39940::$$$message_0340_0055_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39941::$$$message_0340_0055_0001$$$::"...No way. Emiya, is that..."::
39942::$$$message_0340_0056_0000$$$::"Yes. The Holy Grail was an enemy you detested. How ironic it is that you are participating in this war."[lr]::
39943::$$$message_0340_0056_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
39944::$$$message_0340_0057_0000$$$::"I understand how you feel. Anyone would hold a grudge if their own happiness was wrongfully taken away.[lr]::
39945::$$$message_0340_0057_0001$$$::...Yes. What I like is your past, Shirou Emiya."[lr]::
39946::$$$message_0340_0057_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
39947::$$$message_0340_0058_0000$$$::"You are qualified to take revenge. You have the right to obtain the Holy Grail and settle what happened ten years ago. That is why I considered having you on my side."[lr]::
39948::$$$message_0340_0058_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
39949::$$$message_0340_0059_0000$$$::"...Now, think it over, boy.[lr]::
39950::$$$message_0340_0059_0001$$$::I do not wish for battle either. Killing each other is foolish, right? If the Holy Grail has an infinite abundance of wealth, then it should not run out no matter how much we split it.[lr]::
39951::$$$message_0340_0059_0002$$$::Then, can you not share the Holy Grail with those you trust?"::
39952::$$$message_0340_0060_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::

39954::$$$message_0340_0060_0002$$$::Caster must genuinely think so.::

39958::$$$message_0340_0062_0000$$$::"No, there are ways to obtain the Holy Grail without fighting, Saber. Even if it is not possible for other Servants, I, as Caster, can read the tricks of the Holy Grail.[lr]::
