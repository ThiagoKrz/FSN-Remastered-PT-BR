36589::$$$message_0307_0000_0000$$$::It's lunchtime, so I go to the student council room.[lr]::
36590::$$$message_0307_0000_0001$$$::"Excuse me."[lr]::
36591::$$$message_0307_0000_0002$$$::I say, and open the door.[lr]::
36592::$$$message_0307_0000_0003$$$::"Oh. You're going to eat lunch here today, Emiya?"[lr]::
36593::$$$message_0307_0000_0004$$$::Issei is eating lunch by himself inside.[lr]::
36594::$$$message_0307_0000_0005$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36595::$$$message_0307_0000_0006$$$::...Good, this is convenient.::
36596::$$$message_0307_0001_0000$$$::"How are you doing? How did yesterday's incident turn out?"[lr]::
36597::$$$message_0307_0001_0001$$$::I sit at the table and try to act casual.::
36598::$$$message_0307_0002_0000$$$::"I haven't been given an explanation yet. They've only been considering what happened to the chemicals in the empty classroom on the first floor. That's all that resulted from yesterday and this morning's search."[lr]::
36599::$$$message_0307_0002_0001$$$::He seems unhappy, as he bites into a stiff carrot.::
36600::$$$message_0307_0003_0000$$$::"But you were fortunate at least. By ditching after lunch, you were able to avoid this disaster. Yes, I guess you were rewarded for your daily conduct."::
36601::$$$message_0307_0004_0000$$$::This time, he sips on his tea happily.[lr]::
36602::$$$message_0307_0004_0001$$$::...Well, this is awkward.[lr]::
36603::$$$message_0307_0004_0002$$$::It doesn't seem like the right time to interrogate him, so I'll wait for a while and see.::
36604::$$$message_0307_0005_0000$$$::"Huh...!?"[lr]::
36605::$$$message_0307_0005_0001$$$::Damn, there's only five minutes left before break is up.::
36606::$$$message_0307_0006_0000$$$::"Hm? What happened, Emiya? Did you come up with something?"[lr]::
36607::$$$message_0307_0006_0001$$$::"I didn't come up with anything, but I remembered something. I don't have time to slack off."[lr]::
36608::$$$message_0307_0006_0002$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
36609::$$$message_0307_0006_0003$$$::I hurriedly wrap my lunch back up and face Issei.::
36610::$$$message_0307_0007_0000$$$::"...Hm, I have a bad feeling about this. Please do not ask me for money.[lr]::
36611::$$$message_0307_0007_0001$$$::I don't have any even if you beg."[lr]::
36612::$$$message_0307_0007_0002$$$::I get up from my chair.[lr]::
36613::$$$message_0307_0007_0003$$$::...There's no time.[lr]::
36614::$$$message_0307_0007_0004$$$::I just have to dive right in.[lr]::
36615::$$$message_0307_0007_0005$$$::"Issei. Don't ask any questions and take your shirt off."[lr]::
36616::$$$message_0307_0007_0006$$$::I demand as firmly as possible.::
36617::$$$message_0307_0008_0000$$$::"W-whaaat!!!???"[lr]::
36618::$$$message_0307_0008_0001$$$::"I said, take off your uniform. Not just your jacket, but your shirt too.[lr]::
36619::$$$message_0307_0008_0002$$$::This isn't going to work unless you're stripped down."::
36620::$$$message_0307_0009_0000$$$::"...W-w-w-what are you asking!? Are you insane!? Is this a new method of debate!? Must I, right this instant!?"[lr]::
36621::$$$message_0307_0009_0001$$$::"Yeah, bring it on. Hurry up and strip. It'll be too late once school ends!"::
36622::$$$message_0307_0010_0000$$$::I grab at Issei.[lr]::
36623::$$$message_0307_0010_0001$$$::"Woah...! Hey, stop it, you fool! Are you still the son of a samurai!?"::
36624::$$$message_0307_0011_0000$$$::"...All right."[lr]::
36625::$$$message_0307_0011_0001$$$::In the end, there was no Command Spell on Issei's body.[lr]::
36626::$$$message_0307_0011_0002$$$::I searched thoroughly, but I didn't see anything that looked like a Command Spell.::
36627::$$$message_0307_0012_0000$$$::"Good. Man, I'm glad."[lr]::
36628::$$$message_0307_0012_0001$$$::I nod to myself.::
36629::$$$message_0307_0013_0000$$$::"What's so good about this...!? Why would you go so far just to do nothing!?"[lr]::
36630::$$$message_0307_0013_0001$$$::Mm? Oh, yeah. Sorry, Issei. I can't tell you what's going on, but there was something I had to check. But it's done now, so there's no problem anymore.::
36631::$$$message_0307_0014_0000$$$::I bow my head and apologize.[lr]::
36632::$$$message_0307_0014_0001$$$::"Mrgh... O-okay. If you think you have done something bad, it's natural for you to apologize."[lr]::
36633::$$$message_0307_0014_0002$$$::Issei goes silent with a serious expression.::
36634::$$$message_0307_0015_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
36635::$$$message_0307_0015_0001$$$::But now, it's back to square one.[lr]::
36636::$$$message_0307_0015_0002$$$::If Issei, who has ties with Ryudou Temple, is innocent, then there's no one else that could be applicable as Caster's Master.::
36637::$$$message_0307_0016_0000$$$::"...Hey, Issei. Has there been anything unusual at the temple lately?"[lr]::
36638::$$$message_0307_0016_0001$$$::"Hm? Something unusual as in...?"[lr]::
36639::$$$message_0307_0016_0002$$$::"I don't know. Is there anything different than usual?"::
36640::$$$message_0307_0017_0000$$$::"...Let me see. If you mean recently, there is a new woman. But that's about it. My father and brother are as they always are."[lr]::
36641::$$$message_0307_0017_0001$$$::Issei says calmly.::
36642::$$$message_0307_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36643::$$$message_0307_0018_0001$$$::...A new woman.[lr]::
36644::$$$message_0307_0018_0002$$$::Could that be Caster? ...Well, I'm sure that Servant would pretend to be a human without a problem.[lr]::
36645::$$$message_0307_0018_0003$$$::Or could that woman be Caster's Master?::
36646::$$$message_0307_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36647::$$$message_0307_0019_0001$$$::...Should I try and ask Issei?[lr]::
36648::$$$message_0307_0019_0002$$$::Maybe...[lr]::
