30217::$$$message_0242_0001_0000$$$::The sparks of the clashing swords, the hustling intense spirit.[lr]::
30218::$$$message_0242_0001_0001$$$::The many attacks were inexperienced, not something that one could call a sword dance.[lr]::
30219::$$$message_0242_0001_0002$$$::We were both clumsy and didn't know of retreat.[lr]::
30220::$$$message_0242_0001_0003$$$::The ridiculous sounds of swords were annoying, and I have no memory of them.::
30221::$$$message_0242_0002_0000$$$::At that time...[lr]::
30222::$$$message_0242_0002_0001$$$::I lost an answer and found an answer at the same time.[lr]::
30223::$$$message_0242_0002_0002$$$::A plus and a minus makes zero.[lr]::
30224::$$$message_0242_0002_0003$$$::Nothing has changed after all.[lr]::
30225::$$$message_0242_0002_0004$$$::He's him, and I'm me. I'm just dreaming of his fading memories.::
30226::$$$message_0242_0003_0000$$$::It's only been a month.[lr]::
30227::$$$message_0242_0003_0001$$$::But it already feels so nostalgic.::
30228::$$$message_0242_0004_0000$$$::It feels like it happened so long ago.[lr]::
30229::$$$message_0242_0004_0001$$$::The memory of it is fading day by day, and I can't even remember what the person I was fighting looked like.[lr]::
30230::$$$message_0242_0004_0002$$$::That also can't be helped.[lr]::
30231::$$$message_0242_0004_0003$$$::That was something that was impossible from the start.[lr]::
30232::$$$message_0242_0004_0004$$$::It's not like either of us believed that the fight would change anything.[lr]::
30233::$$$message_0242_0004_0005$$$::We just tried to attack our own shadow to ascertain ourselves.::
30234::$$$message_0242_0005_0000$$$::That's why there was nothing we would gain from winning.[lr]::
30235::$$$message_0242_0005_0001$$$::Something like that has been stuck from the start and won't go away.[lr]::
30236::$$$message_0242_0005_0002$$$::It's the end if you lose, and there is no prize if you win.[lr]::
30237::$$$message_0242_0005_0003$$$::Man, it really didn't pay off.::
30238::$$$message_0242_0006_0000$$$::But I can still recall it if I close my eyes.[lr]::
30239::$$$message_0242_0006_0001$$$::The echoing sounds of unrefined metals.[lr]::
30240::$$$message_0242_0006_0002$$$::A distant and blinding sword fight that did not know of retreat.::
30241::$$$message_0242_0007_0000$$$::It was our beliefs that clashed with each other.[lr]::
30242::$$$message_0242_0007_0001$$$::I opposed my own ideal to carry out my hope.[lr]::
30243::$$$message_0242_0007_0002$$$::The outcome is still undecided.[lr]::
30244::$$$message_0242_0007_0003$$$::I don't know which one won or which one remained.[lr]::
30245::$$$message_0242_0007_0004$$$::It should be a while until the answer comes out.::
30246::$$$message_0242_0008_0000$$$::An illusion like a mirage that disappears if one turns around.[lr]::
30247::$$$message_0242_0008_0001$$$::Just using the reverberations as a guide, my feet will eventually reach this place...::
30248::$$$message_0242_0009_0000$$$::"Hey. Wake up, you fool.[lr]::
30249::$$$message_0242_0009_0001$$$::Everyone left for the assembly. Are you planning to boycott it even though you are at school?"[lr]::
30250::$$$message_0242_0009_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
30251::$$$message_0242_0009_0003$$$::...My body is being shaken.[lr]::
30252::$$$message_0242_0009_0004$$$::The voice brings my sleeping mind back to reality.::
30253::$$$message_0242_0010_0000$$$::"...Mm? Wait, why are you here?"[lr]::
30254::$$$message_0242_0010_0001$$$::I lift my face up from my desk and stare at my classmate's face.::
30255::$$$message_0242_0011_0000$$$::"Why!? This is our classroom, today is our last day of being second years, and it's ten minutes before our end of term assembly![lr]::
30256::$$$message_0242_0011_0001$$$::I came to look for you since I didn't see you, but I didn't think you would actually be sleeping!"::
30257::$$$message_0242_0012_0000$$$::I don't know if he's panicking or if he's mad, but it's rare for Issei to be yelling.[lr]::
30258::$$$message_0242_0012_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
30259::$$$message_0242_0012_0002$$$::It is only Issei and me in the classroom.[lr]::
30260::$$$message_0242_0012_0003$$$::It's 9:50 AM.[lr]::
30261::$$$message_0242_0012_0004$$$::The end of term assembly is from 10 AM, so everyone must've gone to the gymnasium.::
30262::$$$message_0242_0013_0000$$$::"Hello? Are you really awake, Emiya?"[lr]::
30263::$$$message_0242_0013_0001$$$::"...Yeah, I'm completely awake now. Thanks, Issei. I'm glad you came to wake me up."::
30264::$$$message_0242_0014_0000$$$::"Hm? ...Yeah, it's fine if you understand. But thank me later, we won't make it unless we hurry.[lr]::
30265::$$$message_0242_0014_0001$$$::I can't even imagine what kind of rampage Ms. Fujimura will go on if she finds out we're not there." ::
30266::$$$message_0242_0015_0000$$$::"Mm, got it. I can't face my classmates if she gives us ridiculous amounts of homework before vacation. I'll make sure to calm Fuji-nee down."[lr]::
30267::$$$message_0242_0015_0001$$$::"Yeah, I'm counting on you. Forget facing our classmates, we will definitely be cursed if we get even more homework."::
30268::$$$message_0242_0016_0000$$$::That's a scary way to put it, but it's frightening how it's the truth.[lr]::
30269::$$$message_0242_0016_0001$$$::Last summer, the amount of extra homework we got after we made Fuji-nee mad was insane.[lr]::
30270::$$$message_0242_0016_0002$$$::It wasn't even English homework.[lr]::
30271::$$$message_0242_0016_0003$$$::I don't know what she was thinking when she told us to enter some competition anywhere in the country and win a medal.::
30272::$$$message_0242_0017_0000$$$::"Emiya! I'm telling you to hurry!"[lr]::
30273::$$$message_0242_0017_0001$$$::"Sorry, I'm coming."[lr]::
30274::$$$message_0242_0017_0002$$$::We should hurry to the gymnasium for now.[lr]::
30275::$$$message_0242_0017_0003$$$::It takes three minutes if we run from here to the gymnasium. We should be able to get there five minutes before if no teacher finds us.::
30276::$$$message_0242_0018_0000$$$::"No, we can't run in the hallway."[lr]::
30277::$$$message_0242_0018_0001$$$::That was naïve of me.[lr]::
30278::$$$message_0242_0018_0002$$$::As expected of the student council president. He's really committed, as he is still following the rules even in this situation.::
30279::$$$message_0242_0019_0000$$$::"That's honorable of you, Issei. But we won't make it if we walk."[lr]::
30280::$$$message_0242_0019_0001$$$::"Let us hurry without running. Even if it's a minute before, we can make up any excuse as long as we get there on time."[lr]::
30281::$$$message_0242_0019_0002$$$::I nod and walk faster.::
30282::$$$message_0242_0020_0000$$$::It's mid-March, but the sky that I see out the window is amazingly blue.[lr]::
30283::$$$message_0242_0020_0001$$$::Fuyuki City has long winters, but it seems like spring is finally around the corner.::
30284::$$$message_0242_0021_0000$$$::   The days went by quickly.[lr]::
30285::$$$message_0242_0021_0001$$$::It's been a month since the Holy Grail War, and the town is back to the normal Fuyuki City.[lr]::
30286::$$$message_0242_0021_0002$$$::The Holy Grail was destroyed, and most of the damage caused by the Masters was taken care of by the church.[lr]::
30287::$$$message_0242_0021_0003$$$::The person that came to substitute for Kirei Kotomine was old but energetic, and everything was settled efficiently.::
30288::$$$message_0242_0022_0000$$$::But, the traces of the war are still left here and there.[lr]::
30289::$$$message_0242_0022_0001$$$::Souichirou Kuzuki, who chose to fight as a Master, is considered missing.::
30290::$$$message_0242_0023_0000$$$::Issei was sad that Kuzuki, whom he respected as an older brother, was gone, but...[lr]::
30291::$$$message_0242_0023_0001$$$::"He suddenly showed up to the temple to start with. It is only fitting that he leaves the same way."[lr]::
30292::$$$message_0242_0023_0002$$$::He just laughed it off.::
30293::$$$message_0242_0024_0000$$$::But what surprised me was Fuji-nee, since it turns out that they often drank tea together.[lr]::
30294::$$$message_0242_0024_0001$$$::She confessed that she wanted to have a match with him at least once, so it seems like she saw through the fact that Kuzuki was a master of martial arts.::
30295::$$$message_0242_0025_0000$$$::Shinji's life was saved by Tohsaka, and he's currently in the hospital.[lr]::
30296::$$$message_0242_0025_0001$$$::Apparently the hospital is part of the Mage's Association, and his body is recovering.[lr]::
30297::$$$message_0242_0025_0002$$$::Sakura is busy visiting Shinji, so she's been showing up only on the weekends this past month.[lr]::
30298::$$$message_0242_0025_0003$$$::I went to go snoop on them once, but they were getting along so well that I thought I was seeing things.::
30299::$$$message_0242_0026_0000$$$::I don't know if whatever was possessing him went away from that incident, or if he's just unenergetic from the wounds.[lr]::
30300::$$$message_0242_0026_0001$$$::Either way, the Shinji that I saw being taken care of by Sakura was sarcastic but sincere, and he's acting more like the Shinji that I first met.::
30301::$$$message_0242_0027_0000$$$::    Saber is not here anymore.[lr]::
30302::$$$message_0242_0027_0001$$$::After she destroyed the Holy Grail, she left this world as a Servant.[lr]::
30303::$$$message_0242_0027_0002$$$::The moment she destroyed the Holy Grail with her own hands, she must've been released from whatever was binding her.::
30304::$$$message_0242_0028_0000$$$::...It's frustrating that I didn't get to say goodbye, but I should be glad that she's released from her fixation on the Holy Grail. [lr]::
30305::$$$message_0242_0028_0001$$$::If... If I am able to see her again, I want to thank her as much as I can.::
30306::$$$message_0242_0029_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
30307::$$$message_0242_0029_0001$$$::Finally, the most important person...::
30308::$$$message_0242_0030_0000$$$::"...Guh, Tohsaka."[lr]::
30309::$$$message_0242_0030_0001$$$::We get down to the first floor and on our way to the corridor towards the gymnasium...::
30310::$$$message_0242_0031_0000$$$::"Oh, Mr. President. Are you patrolling the building at this time? Or are you taking care of each classroom? I'm getting tired of saying this each time, but you really are diligent."::
30311::$$$message_0242_0032_0000$$$::We run into the one representing the students at the assembly, instead of the student council president, as she comes out of the teacher's office.::
30312::$$$message_0242_0033_0000$$$::"...Humph. I am also tired of hearing that line. Try guessing something else for once.[lr]::
30313::$$$message_0242_0033_0001$$$::Or do you keep saying that on purpose?"[lr]::
30314::$$$message_0242_0033_0002$$$::Issei glares at Tohsaka.::
30315::$$$message_0242_0034_0000$$$::"Huh? Of course it was on purpose. What, did you just realize that, Ryudou?"::
30316::$$$message_0242_0035_0000$$$::"...I see. I thought you had a bit more of a sense of humor, but you really are a blockhead.[lr]::
30317::$$$message_0242_0035_0001$$$::I'm sorry. I always used the same greeting to show my affection for you, but I guess it was hard for you to understand."::
30318::$$$message_0242_0036_0000$$$::"Ugh, what do you mean by affection!? I don't remember you ever showing me affection! ...Hey, come on Emiya, we'll be late if we concern ourselves with this vixen!"::
30319::$$$message_0242_0037_0000$$$::Issei sure doesn't get along with Tohsaka.[lr]::
30320::$$$message_0242_0037_0001$$$::...Well, I feel the same way, so I'm in no position to feel any sympathy.::
30321::$$$message_0242_0038_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
30322::$$$message_0242_0038_0001$$$::Our eyes meet as I pass by Tohsaka.::
30323::$$$message_0242_0039_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30324::$$$message_0242_0039_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
30325::$$$message_0242_0039_0002$$$::We decided that we would act normally when there are others around.[lr]::
30326::$$$message_0242_0039_0003$$$::I naturally ignore Tohsaka and follow Issei.::
30327::$$$message_0242_0040_0000$$$::However...[lr]::
30328::$$$message_0242_0040_0001$$$::"Good morning, Emiya. I'm glad you seem well this morning too."[lr]::
30329::$$$message_0242_0040_0002$$$::I don't know what she didn't like, but she embraces my arm and puts on a big smile.::
30330::$$$message_0242_0041_0000$$$::"Toh[line2]"[lr]::
30331::$$$message_0242_0041_0001$$$::My mind goes blank.[lr]::
30332::$$$message_0242_0041_0002$$$::We had been seeing each other every day, but this is the first time we've touched each other like this in a month.::
30333::$$$message_0242_0042_0000$$$::"Tohsa...ka..."[lr]::
30334::$$$message_0242_0042_0001$$$::I desperately try not to blush and resist Tohsaka's touch.::
30335::$$$message_0242_0043_0000$$$::"I'm joking. But it is true that I'm glad, Emiya.[lr]::
30336::$$$message_0242_0043_0001$$$::Oh, let's go home together once you finish helping out the student council after the assembly. I'll [font italic=true]keep on waiting[font italic=false] for you in my classroom."[lr]::
30337::$$$message_0242_0043_0002$$$::Tohsaka puts emphasis on "keep on waiting."::
30338::$$$message_0242_0044_0000$$$::"W-what are you saying!? Let go of him already...!"[lr]::
30339::$$$message_0242_0044_0001$$$::"It has nothing to do with you, Ryudou.[lr]::
30340::$$$message_0242_0044_0002$$$::Well, if you'll excuse me. I'm also busy since I have to make a speech in place of the student council president."::
30341::$$$message_0242_0045_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
30342::$$$message_0242_0045_0001$$$::Tohsaka leaves, with the noisy footsteps of a victor.::
30343::$$$message_0242_0046_0000$$$::"What's going on, Emiya?[lr]::
30344::$$$message_0242_0046_0001$$$::What's your relationship with that vixen...!?"[lr]::
30345::$$$message_0242_0046_0002$$$::"...Well, it's hard to explain.[lr]::
30346::$$$message_0242_0046_0003$$$::First of all, I think I told you before that we became acquaintances."::
30347::$$$message_0242_0047_0000$$$::"That was a month ago! I warned you to do yourself a favor and cut ties with her... O-oh, I get it! Does she know your weakness!?"::
30348::$$$message_0242_0048_0000$$$::"Oh... Well, I guess you can call it a weakness."[lr]::
30349::$$$message_0242_0048_0001$$$::"Ugh, I knew it...![lr]::
30350::$$$message_0242_0048_0002$$$::Damn it, I cannot let you go now, Toshaka...! Consult me, Emiya! Confess, Emiya! Let's pray that the Buddha will give that vixen her due punishment...!"[lr]::
30351::$$$message_0242_0048_0003$$$::Issei shakes my shoulders.::
30352::$$$message_0242_0049_0000$$$::"Look at the time, Issei. The assembly's starting."[lr]::
30353::$$$message_0242_0049_0001$$$::"...I do not care.[lr]::
30354::$$$message_0242_0049_0002$$$::It starts with that vixen's speech anyway. It will be mentally good for us to be a little late...!"::
30355::$$$message_0242_0050_0000$$$::The student council president is still shaking my shoulders.[lr]::
30356::$$$message_0242_0050_0001$$$::Issei is usually calm, but he's a different person when it involves Tohsaka.[lr]::
30357::$$$message_0242_0050_0002$$$::Tohsaka must be his natural enemy, but...::
30358::$$$message_0242_0051_0000$$$::"...Sorry, Issei. I feel bad letting you down, but I can't do anything about Tohsaka. She'll beat me instead if I go beat her.[lr]::
30359::$$$message_0242_0051_0001$$$::...Um, do yourself a favor and don't go near her."::
30360::$$$message_0242_0052_0000$$$:: "...Hm, that's rare for you to be so negative. Is the weakness that she knows about that bad?"[lr]::
30361::$$$message_0242_0052_0001$$$::"...Unfortunately. So I'm leaving it to you to deal with Tohsaka. I'm sure it'll be a tough fight, but please do your best on my behalf."::
30362::$$$message_0242_0053_0000$$$::"...I see, all right. Don't worry, Emiya. For a better school life, I shall do whatever it takes to reveal Tohsaka's true identity and bring about her downfall.[lr]::
30363::$$$message_0242_0053_0001$$$::That vixen seems to be scheming something with the athletic clubs, but the student council will be solid as a rock in a year. The real match starts then."::
30364::$$$message_0242_0054_0000$$$::The student council president laughs fearlessly.[lr]::
30365::$$$message_0242_0054_0001$$$::...Oh, but Issei.[lr]::
30366::$$$message_0242_0054_0002$$$::We'll all be graduating in a year...::
30367::$$$message_0242_0055_0000$$$::The end of term assembly ends, and the school starts to calmly lose its liveliness.[lr]::
30368::$$$message_0242_0055_0001$$$::Spring break has started.[lr]::
30369::$$$message_0242_0055_0002$$$::Most of the students have left with a smile, and the athletic clubs are already starting their training camps today.::
30370::$$$message_0242_0056_0000$$$::There aren't that many students left in the building.[lr]::
30371::$$$message_0242_0056_0001$$$::All the classrooms are empty, and all that is left in the hallway is the redness from the sunset.::
30372::$$$message_0242_0057_0000$$$::"So you're finally done, huh? Issei really makes you help until the very end. I'm sure that's his way of getting back at me."[lr]::
30373::$$$message_0242_0057_0001$$$::An empty classroom.[lr]::
30374::$$$message_0242_0057_0002$$$::Tohsaka smiles and says so as soon as she sees me in the 2-A classroom tinted by the sunset.::
30375::$$$message_0242_0058_0000$$$::"You idiot, it's because you did that ridiculous thing. I would've been released earlier had you not said anything unnecessary."[lr]::
30376::$$$message_0242_0058_0001$$$::I enter the classroom, complaining.[lr]::
30377::$$$message_0242_0058_0002$$$::I wonder why I feel so restless in other classrooms even though they all look the same.::
30378::$$$message_0242_0059_0000$$$::"What? Are you saying it's my fault, Shirou?"[lr]::
30379::$$$message_0242_0059_0001$$$::"Half of it is definitely you. Look, you're the one who said we should act like strangers until we're third years, since it'll be weird if we suddenly get close. So, why did you do such a thing?"::
30380::$$$message_0242_0060_0000$$$::"...Heh. Today is our last day of being second years, so it should be fine if I get a bit of a head start.[lr]::
30381::$$$message_0242_0060_0001$$$::First of all, there are other ways to ignore me.[lr]::
30382::$$$message_0242_0060_0002$$$::Maybe it's fine to do so if we pass by each other during lunch break, but you should've at least acknowledged me, since we were the only ones there."::
30383::$$$message_0242_0061_0000$$$::I don't know what she's upset about, but Tohsaka complains while looking the other way.[lr]::
30384::$$$message_0242_0061_0001$$$::...Hm.[lr]::
30385::$$$message_0242_0061_0002$$$::Is it because of the classroom during the sunset?[lr]::
30386::$$$message_0242_0061_0003$$$::That gesture that I'm used to seeing looks so fresh and cute that it makes me admire her.::
30387::$$$message_0242_0062_0000$$$::"...Geez. Here. I got this, but do you want it?"[lr]::
30388::$$$message_0242_0062_0001$$$:: I offer her the orange juice pack that is distributed to students who help clean up.::
30389::$$$message_0242_0063_0000$$$::"Oh, yeah, I'll take it. Yay, you're thoughtful when it comes to stuff like this."[lr]::
30390::$$$message_0242_0063_0001$$$::She accepts the juice pack and takes a sip out of the straw.[lr]::
30391::$$$message_0242_0063_0002$$$::...She's sitting by the window.[lr]::
30392::$$$message_0242_0063_0003$$$::Tohsaka is looking down at the campus, as if looking at something bright.::
30393::$$$message_0242_0064_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30394::$$$message_0242_0064_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
30395::$$$message_0242_0064_0002$$$::I follow her example and look down at the campus while sipping.[lr]::
30396::$$$message_0242_0064_0003$$$::It must be the track team running.[lr]::
30397::$$$message_0242_0064_0004$$$::Our athletics department is really lively, even though it's spring break starting tomorrow.::
30398::$$$message_0242_0065_0000$$$::"Hey. Weren't you on the track team before, Emiya?"[lr]::
30399::$$$message_0242_0065_0001$$$::Then...[lr]::
30400::$$$message_0242_0065_0002$$$::Tohsaka suddenly asks me something strange.::
30401::$$$message_0242_0066_0000$$$::"The track team? No, I was always in the archery club."[lr]::
30402::$$$message_0242_0066_0001$$$::"...I see. Well, I guess some people are like that. Seeing the sunset just reminded me."[lr]::
30403::$$$message_0242_0066_0002$$$:: Telling me to forget about it, Tohsaka sips on her orange juice.::
30404::$$$message_0242_0067_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30405::$$$message_0242_0067_0001$$$::I'll forget it if she tells me to.[lr]::
30406::$$$message_0242_0067_0002$$$::When she calls me "Emiya" instead of "Shirou," half the time she's making a sarcastic remark, and the other half is when she's saying something important.[lr]::
30407::$$$message_0242_0067_0003$$$::I'm sure this one was the latter.[lr]::
30408::$$$message_0242_0067_0004$$$::After a month of her grueling magecraft course, I'm starting to finally notice Tohsaka's habits.::
30409::$$$message_0242_0068_0000$$$::"...But time sure does fly by.[lr]::
30410::$$$message_0242_0068_0001$$$::It's already been a month since the Holy Grail War ended and you became my apprentice. At this rate, I'm sure a year will fly by as well."::
30411::$$$message_0242_0069_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30412::$$$message_0242_0069_0001$$$::It's been a month since I started learning magecraft from Tohsaka in hopes of becoming stronger.[lr]::
30413::$$$message_0242_0069_0002$$$::I've been putting in hard work and tossed around by Tohsaka's malicious nature so it was a whirlwind, but it went by quickly.::
30414::$$$message_0242_0070_0000$$$::This past month seemed long but felt fast.[lr]::
30415::$$$message_0242_0070_0001$$$::So, then... A year might go by as quick as spring break.::
30416::$$$message_0242_0071_0000$$$::"...A year, huh? We'll be leaving this school by that time."[lr]::
30417::$$$message_0242_0071_0001$$$::"Yeah. Today would be our last time in this classroom, and we'll be in a new classroom starting from April. Just like that, we'll be going to another place a year from now."[lr]::
30418::$$$message_0242_0071_0002$$$::Tohsaka holds her knees and blankly looks out the window, still looking down at the campus.::
30419::$$$message_0242_0072_0000$$$::"Another place, huh?"[lr]::
30420::$$$message_0242_0072_0001$$$::I wonder what I'll be doing when I graduate a year from now.[lr]::
30421::$$$message_0242_0072_0002$$$::...No, I don't even have to think about it.[lr]::
30422::$$$message_0242_0072_0003$$$::What I must do doesn't change.[lr]::
30423::$$$message_0242_0072_0004$$$::I just need to make my ideal come true, just like he believed.::
30424::$$$message_0242_0073_0000$$$::...Well, and...[lr]::
30425::$$$message_0242_0073_0001$$$::I have one other goal that's just as big right now, but I don't want to think about it too much since it's irritating.::
30426::$$$message_0242_0074_0000$$$::"Hey, Emiya. What are you going to do once you graduate? Are you going to succeed your father after all?"[lr]::
30427::$$$message_0242_0074_0001$$$::"Huh? ...Well, yeah, but more than succeeding my father, I want to become a proper mage already. Or else, I won't look cool, right?"::
30428::$$$message_0242_0075_0000$$$::"Oh? Who are you trying to look cool for?"[lr]::
30429::$$$message_0242_0075_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
30430::$$$message_0242_0075_0002$$$::This is it.[lr]::
30431::$$$message_0242_0075_0003$$$::In other words, the other goal is to make her admit defeat.::
30432::$$$message_0242_0076_0000$$$::"I-it doesn't matter. Anyways, my biggest priority is to become a proper mage, so that's why I became your apprentice. Please look after me for one more year."[lr]::
30433::$$$message_0242_0076_0001$$$::"Oh. You're rather confident, trying to become a proper mage in just one year. I took over the role of mentor bracing myself for at least ten years, but you're fine with just one more year, huh?"::
30434::$$$message_0242_0077_0000$$$::"T-ten years...!?[lr]::
30435::$$$message_0242_0077_0001$$$::I-I appreciate it, but... Oh, no, that's not what I meant...! T-that's a really long way ahead. Wouldn't you get tired too?" ::
30436::$$$message_0242_0078_0000$$$::"Not really. Just like your goal is to become a proper mage, my goal is also to make you a proper mage. I have it all planned out in my head, you know? Do you want me to write it out for you?"::
30437::$$$message_0242_0079_0000$$$::"...Oh, um..."[lr]::
30438::$$$message_0242_0079_0001$$$::Um, that's...[lr]::
30439::$$$message_0242_0079_0002$$$::I couldn't ask for more, but...::
30440::$$$message_0242_0080_0000$$$::"But I guess that's impossible. You're going to succed your father, right? Then that means you're staying in this town after you graduate."[lr]::
30441::$$$message_0242_0080_0001$$$::"...Yeah. Well, what about you? Your family supervises Fuyuki, right? Doesn't that mean you can't leave this town either?"::
30442::$$$message_0242_0081_0000$$$::"Me? I'm going to London once I graduate.[lr]::
30443::$$$message_0242_0081_0001$$$:: I was able to get a recommendation from the Mage's Association from this incident, so they're admitting me without any exams."[lr]::
30444::$$$message_0242_0081_0002$$$:: "Wha[line2]you mean that London, the headquarters of the Mage's Association!?"::
30445::$$$message_0242_0082_0000$$$::"Yes. There's a limit to what I can do in Fuyuki, so I'm thinking of studying at the Clock Tower for about five years.[lr]::
30446::$$$message_0242_0082_0001$$$::I heard my father did the same thing, so isn't it natural to go to the most prestigious educational institution if I want to become a proper mage?"::
30447::$$$message_0242_0083_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30448::$$$message_0242_0083_0001$$$::...I'm surprised.[lr]::
30449::$$$message_0242_0083_0002$$$::It's so sudden that my eyes get wide and my head becomes empty.[lr]::
30450::$$$message_0242_0083_0003$$$::For Tohsaka who is a legitimate mage, that much is natural.[lr]::
30451::$$$message_0242_0083_0004$$$::I finally realize the difference in our positions that I hadn't thought about until now.::
30452::$$$message_0242_0084_0000$$$::"London, huh? That's really impressive, right?"[lr]::
30453::$$$message_0242_0084_0001$$$::"Hmm, I'm not sure about that.[lr]::
30454::$$$message_0242_0084_0002$$$::It's vexing, but they didn't invite me because they acknowledged my individual powers. I was only invited because of my father's accomplishments, and because I was the last one standing." ::
30455::$$$message_0242_0085_0000$$$::She says it casually, but it must be impressive after all.[lr]::
30456::$$$message_0242_0085_0001$$$::...But London, huh? ...That's indeed a bit too far.[lr]::
30457::$$$message_0242_0085_0002$$$::And just like my old man who wasn't a part of the Mage's Association, I'm also not good with formal stuff like that.::
30458::$$$message_0242_0086_0000$$$::"...But, you also have the qualifications in that case. If I recommend you, I'm sure they would at least let you take the entrance exam..."::
30459::$$$message_0242_0087_0000$$$::...But, I might be able to move there at least.[lr]::
30460::$$$message_0242_0087_0001$$$::I can start working more, study English, save up enough for the flight to Britain and about a month's worth of living expenses, and find a job over there…::
30461::$$$message_0242_0088_0000$$$::"...I know you're not enthusiastic since the Association is enemy territory for you, but the Clock Tower has the proper equipment and a great environment for training.[lr]::
30462::$$$message_0242_0088_0001$$$::Oh, but you have to keep your Reality Marble a secret, so I guess they'll test your basics... Man, would one year be enough...?"::
30463::$$$message_0242_0089_0000$$$::No, no, even if I hypothetically rented an apartment there...[lr]::
30464::$$$message_0242_0089_0001$$$::I don't know what kind of place the Clock Tower is, but I'm sure Tohsaka will get even busier... In that case, I should study on my own and go see her once I become a proper mage.[lr]::
30465::$$$message_0242_0089_0002$$$::Yeah, that's right, that's right.[lr]::
30466::$$$message_0242_0089_0003$$$::First of all, London isn't even suited for me. I bet I'll faint if I go there and it's filled with people like Kotomine...::
30467::$$$message_0242_0090_0000$$$::"...Hey. Are you listening, Emiya?"[lr]::
30468::$$$message_0242_0090_0001$$$::"Huh? Did you say something, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
30469::$$$message_0242_0090_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
30470::$$$message_0242_0090_0003$$$::Tohsaka goes quiet with a clouded expression.[lr]::
30471::$$$message_0242_0090_0004$$$::   Then...[lr]::
30472::$$$message_0242_0090_0005$$$::As she takes a deep breath, with a serious expression...::
30473::$$$message_0242_0091_0000$$$::"I forgot to mention this, but I'm getting invited as the successor of the Tohsaka family. In other words, I'm able to get an actual room to myself as a proper mage."[lr]::
30474::$$$message_0242_0091_0001$$$::She says something that doesn't make sense.::
30475::$$$message_0242_0092_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
30476::$$$message_0242_0092_0001$$$::"I'm telling you that they approve of me as a proper mage. So it's natural for me to have an apprentice or two, right?[lr]::
30477::$$$message_0242_0092_0002$$$::You know, they have factional disputes over there, so they said I'm allowed to take at least one apprentice."[lr]::
30478::$$$message_0242_0092_0003$$$::Tohsaka glances at my face.::
30479::$$$message_0242_0093_0000$$$::"...Um, that means..."[lr]::
30480::$$$message_0242_0093_0001$$$::Even if I'm thickheaded, I can at least tell what Tohsaka is trying to say.[lr]::
30481::$$$message_0242_0093_0002$$$::In other words...::
30482::$$$message_0242_0094_0000$$$::"That's right. It seems like I can take at least one person unconditionally as an assistant. In that case, you won't have to take the exam, and you'll be exempt from any tuition fees.[lr]::
30483::$$$message_0242_0094_0001$$$::...Well, you'll be in a disadvantageous position where you're a student at the Association without being a part of it."::
30484::$$$message_0242_0095_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30485::$$$message_0242_0095_0001$$$::Color returns to my mind that went white.[lr]::
30486::$$$message_0242_0095_0002$$$::No, I force color back into it and mobilize it.[lr]::
30487::$$$message_0242_0095_0003$$$::What Tohsaka is saying...[lr]::
30488::$$$message_0242_0095_0004$$$::I rack my brain and absorb myself into weighing my options that I have a year from now.[lr]::
30489::$$$message_0242_0095_0005$$$::I must look funny being flustered, as Tohsaka is giggling.::
30490::$$$message_0242_0096_0000$$$::"W-what? I'm not being manipulated by your words."[lr]::
30491::$$$message_0242_0096_0001$$$::"That's all I have to say. I'll be going to London."::
30492::$$$message_0242_0097_0000$$$::She looks softly at me.[lr]::
30493::$$$message_0242_0097_0001$$$::Tohsaka looks at me with a mischievous expression.[lr]::
30494::$$$message_0242_0097_0002$$$::"So, what will you do, Shirou?"[lr]::
30495::$$$message_0242_0097_0003$$$::She gently asks me, as if seeing through my heart.::
30496::$$$message_0242_0098_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30497::$$$message_0242_0098_0001$$$::My face turns red in an instant.[lr]::
30498::$$$message_0242_0098_0002$$$::Her words and behavior alone blows away my trivial humility and dislike towards the Association.[lr]::
30499::$$$message_0242_0098_0003$$$::...This is what I mean by Tohsaka knowing my weakness.[lr]::
30500::$$$message_0242_0098_0004$$$::Falling for her is a weakness that I haven't been able to deal with for a long time.::
30501::$$$message_0242_0099_0000$$$::"Oh, you're suddenly quiet. I haven't heard your answer yet."[lr]::
30502::$$$message_0242_0099_0001$$$::She keeps smiling mischievously.[lr]::
30503::$$$message_0242_0099_0002$$$::She knows what my answer is, yet she pursues and attacks mercilessly.::
30504::$$$message_0242_0100_0000$$$::"Uh... So, I..."[lr]::
30505::$$$message_0242_0100_0001$$$::London is honestly too far, but I can't imagine learning magecraft from anyone other than Tohsaka.[lr]::
30506::$$$message_0242_0100_0002$$$::And more than that, I wasn't even thinking of parting with Tohsaka.[lr]::
30507::$$$message_0242_0100_0003$$$::Most of all, I want to be with... Tohsaka...::
30508::$$$message_0242_0101_0000$$$::"Geez. Be clear, this is important.[lr]::
30509::$$$message_0242_0101_0001$$$::You'll become my assistant, but will you come with me?"::
30510::$$$message_0242_0102_0000$$$::"S-shut up, idiot...! Idiot, idiot, idiot! I-i-if it's so important, tell me about it in a more appropriate place! I can't answer you when it's so sudden...!!!"::
30511::$$$message_0242_0103_0000$$$:: I don't know what will happen to me if I stay like this, so I look away from Tohsaka.[lr]::
30512::$$$message_0242_0103_0001$$$::...I still feel her presence through my back.[lr]::
30513::$$$message_0242_0103_0002$$$::Tohsaka happily watches me sweat.::
30514::$$$message_0242_0104_0000$$$::"Hey, Shirou. What's your answer?"[lr]::
30515::$$$message_0242_0104_0001$$$::A gentle voice like a whisper.[lr]::
30516::$$$message_0242_0104_0002$$$::...I give up.[lr]::
30517::$$$message_0242_0104_0003$$$::Was it this hard to just reply and nod honestly?[lr]::
30518::$$$message_0242_0104_0004$$$::"..."[lr]::
30519::$$$message_0242_0104_0005$$$::But, I can't look back at Tohsaka unless I say it clearly.::
30520::$$$message_0242_0105_0000$$$::"...Idiot. Don't ask me such an obvious question."[lr]::
30521::$$$message_0242_0105_0001$$$::I look at Tohsaka just with my eyes and tell her my true feelings to the best of my ability.[lr]::
30522::$$$message_0242_0105_0002$$$::Tohsaka's smile widens just from those words.::
30523::$$$message_0242_0105_0003$$$::"...Yeah. Then, I look forward to working with you from now on too, Emiya.[lr]::
30524::$$$message_0242_0105_0004$$$::I'm going to train you without holding back until you become a proper mage, so brace yourself."::
30525::$$$message_0242_0106_0000$$$::"...Same here. By the way, I'm taking that seriously. I'm going to become a proper mage, so you'll have to look after me."[lr]::
30526::$$$message_0242_0106_0001$$$::"Of course. It's my ambition to turn you into a new man and make you happy. I won't let you give up just from being taken to London."::
30527::$$$message_0242_0107_0000$$$::I don't know where her previous cuteness went.[lr]::
30528::$$$message_0242_0107_0001$$$::Tohsaka says with her confident smile and jumps off of the desk.::
30529::$$$message_0242_0108_0000$$$::...The sun should set soon.[lr]::
30530::$$$message_0242_0108_0001$$$::Spring break will end, it'll become April, and another year should pass by quickly.[lr]::
30531::$$$message_0242_0108_0002$$$::We will part with this scenery until then.[lr]::
30532::$$$message_0242_0108_0003$$$::After a year...[lr]::
30533::$$$message_0242_0108_0004$$$::I will be spending my last moments of student life with Tohsaka like this.::
30534::$$$message_0242_0109_0000$$$::"Let's go home. We're going to have a lively dinner at your place tonight."[lr]::
30535::$$$message_0242_0109_0001$$$::We leave the classroom without any regrets.[lr]::
30536::$$$message_0242_0109_0002$$$::I hear the liveliness of the athletic clubs from the schoolyard.[lr]::
30537::$$$message_0242_0109_0003$$$::Their shouts are distant and remind me of a sword fight from some time ago.::
30538::$$$message_0242_0110_0000$$$::I can't stay in the same place forever.[lr]::
30539::$$$message_0242_0110_0001$$$::Tohsaka and I will be going to a different place a year from now.[lr]::
30540::$$$message_0242_0110_0002$$$::It should be a while until I find out whether this is the right choice or not.::
30541::$$$message_0242_0111_0000$$$::I recall that red figure just once.[lr]::
30542::$$$message_0242_0111_0001$$$::Neither this classroom nor that sword fight will change.[lr]::
30543::$$$message_0242_0111_0002$$$::Everything is the same.[lr]::
30544::$$$message_0242_0111_0003$$$::An illusion like a mirage that disappears if one turns around.::
30545::$$$message_0242_0112_0000$$$::But I can get there if I aim high.[lr]::
30546::$$$message_0242_0112_0001$$$::I will definitely catch up to his back with Tohsaka's help.[lr]::
30547::$$$message_0242_0112_0002$$$::So I'll come up with an answer at that time.::
30548::$$$message_0242_0113_0000$$$::...The sound of swords echoing in the distance.[lr]::
30549::$$$message_0242_0113_0001$$$::Using that as a guide, I will eventually reach that place.::
30550::$$$message_0242_0114_0000$$$::   What came and went were those distant memories.[lr]::
30551::$$$message_0242_0114_0001$$$::   They were signs that he left behind, cut off, and could not be returned.::
30552::$$$message_0242_0115_0000$$$::The sparks of clashing swords.[lr]::
30553::$$$message_0242_0115_0001$$$::The hustling intense spirit.[lr]::
30554::$$$message_0242_0115_0002$$$::The many attacks were inexperienced.[lr]::
30555::$$$message_0242_0115_0003$$$::It could not be called a sword dance, as they were clumsy and fatal attacks that just tried to deny each other.[lr]::
30556::$$$message_0242_0115_0004$$$::Why did that revive such a worn-out oath?::
30557::$$$message_0242_0116_0000$$$::                                        That was an impossible sword fight.::
30558::$$$message_0242_0117_0000$$$::His charging body was covered in wounds.[lr]::
30559::$$$message_0242_0117_0001$$$::His fingers were broken, limbs torn apart, and the boy had not realized, but his breathing had stopped long ago.[lr]::
30560::$$$message_0242_0117_0002$$$::His speed to step in was trifling, and his repeated attacks were mediocre.[lr]::
30561::$$$message_0242_0117_0003$$$::He absorbed knowledge and got to the level where he could endure combat, but he had returned to his former self.::
30562::$$$message_0242_0118_0000$$$::A mediocre attack that was swung haphazardly.[lr]::
30563::$$$message_0242_0118_0001$$$::However...[lr]::
30564::$$$message_0242_0118_0002$$$::That attack was heavier than any other that came before.::
30565::$$$message_0242_0119_0000$$$::There is no hero of justice.[lr]::
30566::$$$message_0242_0119_0001$$$::The boy's mind was knocked down by the one who grew to realize that more than anyone else, saying, "Your ideal is fake."[lr]::
30567::$$$message_0242_0119_0002$$$::The distorted mind should collapse from being unable to bear it.[lr]::
30568::$$$message_0242_0119_0003$$$::It was obvious that the boy will be devoured by his own contradiction.::
30569::$$$message_0242_0120_0000$$$::But, where are the signs of him giving in?[lr]::
30570::$$$message_0242_0120_0001$$$::There is no lie in his broken body and him gripping his sword, holding his loosening spirit together.::
30571::$$$message_0242_0121_0000$$$::The intensity of the sword fight is like nothing before.[lr]::
30572::$$$message_0242_0121_0001$$$::The boy recklessly swings his sword.[lr]::
30573::$$$message_0242_0121_0002$$$::The attacks are equally matched.[lr]::
30574::$$$message_0242_0121_0003$$$::The space is filled with sparks, and anything that would come between them would get cut to pieces.[lr]::
30575::$$$message_0242_0121_0004$$$::That was the embodiment of their minds that melt together, even though they repel each other. ::
30576::$$$message_0242_0122_0000$$$::The desperate blow that strikes.[lr]::
30577::$$$message_0242_0122_0001$$$::It is no more than the final flames that one shows when they see the end.[lr]::
30578::$$$message_0242_0122_0002$$$::The boy is out of breath with every blow, almost falls, steadies himself, and swings the sword again.::
30579::$$$message_0242_0123_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30580::$$$message_0242_0123_0001$$$::Seeing that, he confirms it.[lr]::
30581::$$$message_0242_0123_0002$$$::The enemy has no more strength left.[lr]::
30582::$$$message_0242_0123_0003$$$::The boy in front of him is a corpse, just as he looks.[lr]::
30583::$$$message_0242_0123_0004$$$::However...[lr]::
30584::$$$message_0242_0123_0005$$$::Why does power endlessly remain in his arms that swings his sword?::
30585::$$$message_0242_0124_0000$$$::He sees an illusion.[lr]::
30586::$$$message_0242_0124_0001$$$::It must be because he was bored from seeing him swing his sword know it is useless.[lr]::
30587::$$$message_0242_0124_0002$$$::The irritation boils up his most detestable impulse.::
30588::$$$message_0242_0125_0000$$$::...What did he feel was beautiful, and what did he believe was noble?::
30589::$$$message_0242_0126_0000$$$::The boy said so,[lr]::
30590::$$$message_0242_0126_0001$$$::That he did not want to see any more people die meaninglessly.[lr]::
30591::$$$message_0242_0126_0002$$$::He wanted to save everyone that was suffering if he could save them.::
30592::$$$message_0242_0127_0000$$$::It is out of the question.[lr]::
30593::$$$message_0242_0127_0001$$$::He knows that the fact that it is hypocrisy and meaningless happiness.[lr]::
30594::$$$message_0242_0127_0002$$$::The theory that others are more important than yourself is an ideal that should never be held.::
30595::$$$message_0242_0128_0000$$$::...But.[lr]::
30596::$$$message_0242_0128_0001$$$::Did he ever not dream that it would be so wonderful if he could really live like that...?::
30597::$$$message_0242_0129_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
30598::$$$message_0242_0129_0001$$$::He cannot hear what his enemy is saying.[lr]::
30599::$$$message_0242_0129_0002$$$::His enemy's voice is that weak, but his attacks are relentless.[lr]::
30600::$$$message_0242_0129_0003$$$::Both of his hands that are gripping his swords are one with the hilt.[lr]::
30601::$$$message_0242_0129_0004$$$::It must be to secure the sword, but the impact would go directly to his body like that.[lr]::
30602::$$$message_0242_0129_0005$$$::The boy is covered in blood, and if he takes a step back, he will fall forward and die.[lr]::
30603::$$$message_0242_0129_0006$$$::For the boy, he should be suffering like hell with every attack he makes.::
30604::$$$message_0242_0130_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
30605::$$$message_0242_0130_0001$$$::Voices that cannot be made out.[lr]::
30606::$$$message_0242_0130_0002$$$::The boy, who is on the verge of death, single-mindedly faces the obstacle in front of him.[lr]::
30607::$$$message_0242_0130_0003$$$::He does not need to be told what he is driven by.::
30608::$$$message_0242_0131_0000$$$::                                          It is a bad dream.[lr]::
30609::$$$message_0242_0131_0001$$$::                                          He is being shown an old mirror.::
30610::$$$message_0242_0132_0000$$$::He keeps swinging his sword with tearing arms.[lr]::
30611::$$$message_0242_0132_0001$$$::The only thing there is a strained yell.[lr]::
30612::$$$message_0242_0132_0002$$$::"...!"[lr]::
30613::$$$message_0242_0132_0003$$$::There were people who could not be saved and there was him, who could not save them.[lr]::
30614::$$$message_0242_0132_0004$$$::Seeing the people dying meaninglessly, and he swore to never let this happen again...::
30615::$$$message_0242_0133_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
30616::$$$message_0242_0133_0001$$$::There is one thing that comes and goes through his mind.[lr]::
30617::$$$message_0242_0133_0002$$$::Things he believes in...[lr]::
30618::$$$message_0242_0133_0003$$$::Things he believed in...[lr]::
30619::$$$message_0242_0133_0004$$$::An ideal that he swore not to surrender to anyone else.[lr]::
30620::$$$message_0242_0133_0005$$$::Something that he swore not to surrender to anyone else even now...::
30621::$$$message_0242_0134_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
30622::$$$message_0242_0134_0001$$$::He knew that there is no end to this sword fight that is repeated.::
30623::$$$message_0242_0135_0000$$$::This enemy will not stop.[lr]::
30624::$$$message_0242_0135_0001$$$::He won't stop on his own.[lr]::
30625::$$$message_0242_0135_0002$$$::Even though the boy is attacking with all his might, he takes no notice of the boy.[lr]::
30626::$$$message_0242_0135_0003$$$::What the boy is trying to slash through is himself, the one who obstructs himself.[lr]::
30627::$$$message_0242_0135_0004$$$::The enemy swung his sword for what he believed in and what he will keep on believing in.::
30628::$$$message_0242_0136_0000$$$::"Ungh..."[lr]::
30629::$$$message_0242_0136_0001$$$::Realizing that, he grits his teeth furiously.[lr]::
30630::$$$message_0242_0136_0002$$$::The boy keeps challenging, knowing that he cannot win and that it's meaningless.[lr]::
30631::$$$message_0242_0136_0003$$$::That is the exact mistake he made.[lr]::
30632::$$$message_0242_0136_0004$$$::   But, then why?[lr]::
30633::$$$message_0242_0136_0005$$$::Why do these eyes keep on staring at him?::
30634::$$$message_0242_0137_0000$$$::A clashing sound.[lr]::
30635::$$$message_0242_0137_0001$$$::The attack is easily repelled.[lr]::
30636::$$$message_0242_0137_0002$$$::The opponent that was unable to dodge any of the attacks repels the attack like it's nothing.::
30637::$$$message_0242_0137_0003$$$::   The mirror breaks.[lr]::
30638::$$$message_0242_0137_0004$$$::He is not strong.[lr]::
30639::$$$message_0242_0137_0005$$$::He is not strong at all.[lr]::
30640::$$$message_0242_0137_0006$$$::There is nothing more unsightly than him risking his life to fight.[lr]::
30641::$$$message_0242_0137_0007$$$::However...[lr]::
30642::$$$message_0242_0137_0008$$$::Who can laugh at him...?::
30643::$$$message_0242_0138_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30644::$$$message_0242_0138_0001$$$::His breath stops.[lr]::
30645::$$$message_0242_0138_0002$$$::Parrying the sword, the enemy readies his sword with a remarkably bigger movement than other times.[lr]::
30646::$$$message_0242_0138_0003$$$::A final blow.[lr]::
30647::$$$message_0242_0138_0004$$$::Can the boy keep on standing with his wounded body and fading spirit?::
30648::$$$message_0242_0139_0000$$$::Of course he can.[lr]::
30649::$$$message_0242_0139_0001$$$::The boy has surpassed that limit ten times.[lr]::
30650::$$$message_0242_0139_0002$$$::Then, it is obvious that the enemy in front of him won't stop even if this attack is blocked.::
30651::$$$message_0242_0140_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
30652::$$$message_0242_0140_0001$$$::The boy swings his sword as he collapses.[lr]::
30653::$$$message_0242_0140_0002$$$::Those eyes...[lr]::
30654::$$$message_0242_0140_0003$$$::They are looking straight at only him...::
30655::$$$message_0242_0141_0000$$$::He seems a nostalgic dream for an instant.::
30656::$$$message_0242_0142_0000$$$::                         Whose dream was that, and who inherited that dream?::
30657::$$$message_0242_0143_0000$$$::"                              !!!"[lr]::
30658::$$$message_0242_0143_0001$$$::The boy's voice reaches the empty mind.[lr]::
30659::$$$message_0242_0143_0002$$$::A single scenery closes in in front of him.::
30660::$$$message_0242_0144_0000$$$::   What an ugly and entrenched, fake goodwill.[lr]::
30661::$$$message_0242_0144_0001$$$::   That beautiful ideal to struggle for.::
30662::$$$message_0242_0145_0000$$$::The final blow reaches him.[lr]::
30663::$$$message_0242_0145_0001$$$::But the man does not watch the sword that is about to pierce him.::
30664::$$$message_0242_0146_0000$$$::That is the only thing on the boy's mind.[lr]::
30665::$$$message_0242_0146_0001$$$::Even if that heart is fake, the beauty of what he believed in was real.[lr]::
30666::$$$message_0242_0146_0002$$$::   That is something he cannot lie about.[lr]::
30667::$$$message_0242_0146_0003$$$::That is the one thing he can be proud about and something that was his own power.::
30668::$$$message_0242_0147_0000$$$::The boy cries out with his lost voice.[lr]::
30669::$$$message_0242_0147_0001$$$::That he wants everyone to be happy.[lr]::
30670::$$$message_0242_0147_0002$$$::Yes.[lr]::
30671::$$$message_0242_0147_0003$$$::A path to retreat did not exist from the start.[lr]::
30672::$$$message_0242_0147_0004$$$::Because the dream is...::
30673::$$$message_0242_0148_0000$$$::He has made many mistakes and caused many sins with his own hands.[lr]::
30674::$$$message_0242_0148_0001$$$::He hated himself and had no other way to atone for them except to kill himself.[lr]::
30675::$$$message_0242_0148_0002$$$::His hands are covered in blood, and it is something that can never be forgiven.[lr]::
30676::$$$message_0242_0148_0003$$$::But still...::
30677::$$$message_0242_0149_0000$$$::   A straight gaze.[lr]::
30678::$$$message_0242_0149_0001$$$::   Mistakes and lies,[lr]::
30679::$$$message_0242_0149_0002$$$::   shaking off everything that digs into his heart,[lr]::
30680::$$$message_0242_0149_0003$$$::   running without stopping...::
30681::$$$message_0242_0150_0000$$$::The battle ends with a victory.[lr]::
30682::$$$message_0242_0150_0001$$$::The pain that pierces his heart is not a remission of his conviction.[lr]::
30683::$$$message_0242_0150_0002$$$::As the man hates himself, remission will never come.::
30684::$$$message_0242_0151_0000$$$::But, he earns a small answer.[lr]::
30685::$$$message_0242_0151_0001$$$::The answer is only for this summoning. It is a meaningless thing that he will forget the next time he is summoned.[lr]::
30686::$$$message_0242_0151_0002$$$::There is nothing to regret.[lr]::
30687::$$$message_0242_0151_0003$$$::That is something that has already been built and something that the boy will spend the rest of his life building up. ::
30688::$$$message_0242_0152_0000$$$::There is only one thing that comes and goes through his mind.[lr]::
30689::$$$message_0242_0152_0001$$$::He has regrets.[lr]::
30690::$$$message_0242_0152_0002$$$::He doesn't know how many times he wished to redo things.[lr]::
30691::$$$message_0242_0152_0003$$$::Emiya will continue cursing this result and the eternal future.[lr]::
30692::$$$message_0242_0152_0004$$$::But still...::
30693::$$$message_0242_0153_0000$$$::                                             But still... I was not wrong...::
30694::$$$message_0242_0154_0000$$$::                There is nothing to talk about.[lr]::
30695::$$$message_0242_0154_0001$$$::                The boy will remain, and I will leave.[lr]::
30696::$$$message_0242_0154_0002$$$::                The only thing that remain in his memory are the exchanged blows.::
30697::$$$message_0242_0155_0000$$$::The path is long.[lr]::
30698::$$$message_0242_0155_0001$$$::Using the distant reverberations as a guide, the boy heads towards the deserted land.::
