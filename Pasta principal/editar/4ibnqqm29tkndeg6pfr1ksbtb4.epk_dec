59571::$$$message_0541_0000_0000$$$::"Sakura thinks we had a fight?"[lr]::
59572::$$$message_0541_0000_0001$$$::"Huh? I mean, didn't you? She said it was her fault."::
59573::$$$message_0541_0001_0000$$$::"...It might have appeared that way, but Sakura was correct. Far from being a quarrel, it was a conversation that brought my inadequacies to light..."::
59574::$$$message_0541_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59575::$$$message_0541_0002_0001$$$::Wow.[lr]::
59576::$$$message_0541_0002_0002$$$::Saber's grumbling at herself.[lr]::
59577::$$$message_0541_0002_0003$$$::Not that it does a thing to stop her chopsticks from delivering bite after bite of food to her mouth.::
59578::$$$message_0541_0003_0000$$$::"No, sorry I phrased it weirdly. I was curious because of how much it bothers Sakura. Just forget it."::
59579::$$$message_0541_0004_0000$$$::"Haah... both of you keep saying the same thing. Are you perhaps teaming up to tease me?"[lr]::
59580::$$$message_0541_0004_0001$$$::"Why would I go out of my way just to prank you!? And what would Sakura and I have to gain from that?"[lr]::
59581::$$$message_0541_0004_0002$$$::Actually, I'm terrified of pranking Saber and being found out.::
59582::$$$message_0541_0005_0000$$$::"That's true. Then, I suppose it is your mutual way of being considerate to me."[lr]::
59583::$$$message_0541_0005_0001$$$::Saber muses as she ingests an omelette.[lr]::
59584::$$$message_0541_0005_0002$$$::It's good to be a glutton in the morning. Mm-hm.::
59585::$$$message_0541_0006_0000$$$::"But I wonder what Sakura meant. She wouldn't feel that down if it was something petty. Do you mind telling me, Saber?"[lr]::
59586::$$$message_0541_0006_0001$$$::"W-well, it was simply that I was too weak of a Servant. To put it briefly, I failed to protect you due to my lack of skill."::
59587::$$$message_0541_0007_0000$$$::"...I think you're doing more than plenty on that front.[lr]::
59588::$$$message_0541_0007_0001$$$::I just went and fainted on my own last night. You don't need to beat yourself up over it."::
59589::$$$message_0541_0008_0000$$$::"That may be true...but Sakura was right to warn me. It was wrong of me to be unwilling to listen to her.[lr]::
59590::$$$message_0541_0008_0001$$$::No matter what Sakura says, I am making you, my Master, fight in a war."::
59591::$$$message_0541_0009_0000$$$::Saber looks away uncomfortably.[lr]::
59592::$$$message_0541_0009_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
59593::$$$message_0541_0009_0002$$$::I mean, it's strange.[lr]::
59594::$$$message_0541_0009_0003$$$::Why is Saber getting so worked up over something that we already mutually agreed on?::
59595::$$$message_0541_0010_0000$$$::"...unclear. Residents reporting suspicious behavior have requested that authorities investigate houses in the area."::
59596::$$$message_0541_0011_0000$$$::The news is on TV.[lr]::
59597::$$$message_0541_0011_0001$$$::I turned on the TV while eating, and it's showing a story about last night's events.::
59598::$$$message_0541_0012_0000$$$::"Thirty people were found in serious condition and taken immediately to the hospital.[lr]::
59599::$$$message_0541_0012_0001$$$::This marks the seventh mass coma incident this month. Medical exams suggest something akin to food poisoning..."::
59600::$$$message_0541_0013_0000$$$::I finish breakfast and get ready for school.[lr]::
59601::$$$message_0541_0013_0001$$$::I'm going to school to see Tohsaka.[lr]::
59602::$$$message_0541_0013_0002$$$::I need to discuss what happened last night with her[line2]about Zouken Matou and that black Shadow.::
59603::$$$message_0541_0014_0000$$$::"Police strongly suspect that the fresh wave of victims across Miyama South 4-chome was caused by the spread of some drug..."::
59604::$$$message_0541_0015_0000$$$::Miyama South 4-chome.[lr]::
59605::$$$message_0541_0015_0001$$$::Tohsaka was glaring in that direction last night.[lr]::
59606::$$$message_0541_0015_0002$$$::...Archer said that the Shadow was causing the comas.::
59607::$$$message_0541_0016_0000$$$::Thirty unconscious people.[lr]::
59608::$$$message_0541_0016_0001$$$::I've experienced for myself what that was like.[lr]::
59609::$$$message_0541_0016_0002$$$::Like Caster, the Shadow lurks in the dark and sucks magical energy from people around town.::
59610::$$$message_0541_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59611::$$$message_0541_0017_0001$$$::No, it's more than just "sucking."[lr]::
59612::$$$message_0541_0017_0002$$$::Caster had a gentle touch, compared to that thing.[lr]::
59613::$$$message_0541_0017_0003$$$::She cleverly made sure to harvest energy from people in a repeatable, painless way.[lr]::
59614::$$$message_0541_0017_0004$$$::Like drawing blood through a syringe, to use a metaphor.::
59615::$$$message_0541_0018_0000$$$::...This is nothing like that.[lr]::
59616::$$$message_0541_0018_0001$$$::Caster may have only drawn blood, but the thing I saw last night feasts on its victims.[lr]::
59617::$$$message_0541_0018_0002$$$::The Shadow has no mind or mercy. It only cares about devouring its victims' magical energy, mind and all.::
59618::$$$message_0541_0019_0000$$$::"Saber. I need to talk to you before I leave for school."[lr]::
59619::$$$message_0541_0019_0001$$$::"Yes, what is it, Shirou?"::
59620::$$$message_0541_0020_0000$$$::Saber heard what they said on the news, too.[lr]::
59621::$$$message_0541_0020_0001$$$::She probably knows what I'm about to say, but she quietly waits for me to continue, as always.::
59622::$$$message_0541_0021_0000$$$::"It's about our direction going forward. You saw that thing last night, right?"[lr]::
59623::$$$message_0541_0021_0001$$$::"Yes. It was like nothing I have ever seen, and resembled no Phantasmal species that I know of."::
59624::$$$message_0541_0022_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I don't know what it is.[lr]::
59625::$$$message_0541_0022_0001$$$::But it's our enemy. It didn't look like a Master or Servant, but it deliberately targeted me and Tohsaka, and it's been taking magical energy from people around town.[lr]::
59626::$$$message_0541_0022_0002$$$::Then..."::
59627::$$$message_0541_0023_0000$$$::"...We are going to prioritize finding that Shadow?[lr]::
59628::$$$message_0541_0023_0001$$$::You want us to go after something that has nothing to do with us, and ignore the other Masters and Servants?"::
59629::$$$message_0541_0024_0000$$$::Saber gives me a hard stare.[lr]::
59630::$$$message_0541_0024_0001$$$::...Her goal is to obtain the Holy Grail.[lr]::
59631::$$$message_0541_0024_0002$$$::And I'm asking her to help me with an irrelevant objective.[lr]::
59632::$$$message_0541_0024_0003$$$::Of course she'd be against it.[lr]::
59633::$$$message_0541_0024_0004$$$::But still...::
59634::$$$message_0541_0025_0000$$$::"Yeah. We can't leave it alone. I think it takes priority over the Holy Grail War."[lr]::
59635::$$$message_0541_0025_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59636::$$$message_0541_0025_0002$$$::Saber watches me silently for a moment.[lr]::
59637::$$$message_0541_0025_0003$$$::The deafening silence makes me hold my breath.::
59638::$$$message_0541_0026_0000$$$::"...Haah. Goodness, I guessed it might come to this. I'd rather not get involved with that Shadow, but..."[lr]::
59639::$$$message_0541_0026_0001$$$::"Huh? Saber? Are you sure about this?"::
59640::$$$message_0541_0027_0000$$$::"Whether I am or not, I know that you would go off on your own even if I refused.[lr]::
59641::$$$message_0541_0027_0001$$$::In that case, it would completely defeat my purpose here. If I allow you to die, then I will also be unable to remain in this era.[lr]::
59642::$$$message_0541_0027_0002$$$::So I will go along with you, despite whatever misgivings I may have."::
59643::$$$message_0541_0028_0000$$$::"Urgh. Well, yeah, but..."[lr]::
59644::$$$message_0541_0028_0001$$$::"Besides, it is only a matter of time before you repeat yesterday's recklessness if I leave you alone. That was the second time, so there is bound to be a third. I will be forced to apologize to Sakura if it happens again."::
59645::$$$message_0541_0029_0000$$$::"Then..."[lr]::
59646::$$$message_0541_0029_0001$$$::"A Servant should follow its Master's orders, even if I am extremely reluctant to do so. If you have made your decision, Shirou, then I will lend my sword to your effort."::
59647::$$$message_0541_0030_0000$$$::"...Saber."[lr]::
59648::$$$message_0541_0030_0001$$$::"But Shirou, that Shadow is no ordinary opponent. Even Berserker would be easier to bring down."::
59649::$$$message_0541_0031_0000$$$::"Oof...yeah, I felt that on my own skin.[lr]::
59650::$$$message_0541_0031_0001$$$::You...can't really describe it as strong or weak. It's pure misfortune. It isn't something you can beat up until it goes down."::
59651::$$$message_0541_0032_0000$$$::"I have nothing else to add if you understand that.[lr]::
59652::$$$message_0541_0032_0001$$$::...But Shirou, choosing to go after it is the most difficult path of all. Please keep that in mind."::
59653::$$$message_0541_0033_0000$$$::"...? I mean, I'll be careful, but why would you say that? Do you know what it is, like Archer?"::
59654::$$$message_0541_0034_0000$$$::"...No, I am in the same position as you. I have no idea what the Shadow is."::
59655::$$$message_0541_0035_0000$$$::Saber averts her gaze.[lr]::
59656::$$$message_0541_0035_0001$$$::Then, as if uttering an ominous premonition she just had...::
59657::$$$message_0541_0036_0000$$$::"I just have a vague sense that it is like a star of misfortune. Like a curse that brings inescapable ruin upon all it touches."[lr]::
59658::$$$message_0541_0036_0001$$$::She leaves me with that.::
