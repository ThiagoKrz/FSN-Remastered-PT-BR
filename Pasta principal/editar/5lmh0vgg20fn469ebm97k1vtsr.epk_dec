18685::$$$message_0175_0000_0000$$$::   Oh, that's right.[lr]::
18686::$$$message_0175_0000_0001$$$::There's only one thing to do.[lr]::
18687::$$$message_0175_0000_0002$$$::We've always done it this way.[lr]::
18688::$$$message_0175_0000_0003$$$::So we should do the same, right to the end.[lr]::
18689::$$$message_0175_0000_0004$$$::It's not romantic, and it's not elegant, but sitting across from each other and coming up with a plan of action suits me and Saber best.::
18690::$$$message_0175_0001_0000$$$::"Shirou, it makes sense to come up with a plan, but is this the place for that?"[lr]::

18694::$$$message_0175_0002_0002$$$::Okay, now.[lr]::
18695::$$$message_0175_0002_0003$$$::There's a reason I had Saber go inside the shed.::
18696::$$$message_0175_0003_0000$$$::Right now, we have neither a plan nor the means to defeat Gilgamesh.[lr]::
18697::$$$message_0175_0003_0001$$$::So it goes without saying that we need...something extra.[lr]::
18698::$$$message_0175_0003_0002$$$::So...[lr]::
