72019::$$$message_0662_0000_0000$$$::   A tepid breeze caresses my cheeks.::
72020::$$$message_0662_0001_0000$$$::We come to the end of the passage, which opens into a larger cavern.[lr]::
72021::$$$message_0662_0001_0001$$$::It's as wide as the school grounds.[lr]::
72022::$$$message_0662_0001_0002$$$::I can't see the ceiling in the murk, but it could be as high as ten meters.::
72023::$$$message_0662_0002_0000$$$::There are no signs of life.[lr]::
72024::$$$message_0662_0002_0001$$$::The forgotten underground wasteland reminds me of the pictures of the moon's surface I saw in books, long ago.[lr]::
72025::$$$message_0662_0002_0002$$$::There...[lr]::
72026::$$$message_0662_0002_0003$$$::stands Saber, waiting for us.::
72027::$$$message_0662_0003_0000$$$::She's the only one in the cave.[lr]::
72028::$$$message_0662_0003_0001$$$::I don't see Sakura, Zouken, or Assassin.[lr]::
72029::$$$message_0662_0003_0002$$$::Only the darkened swordswoman blocks our path.::
72030::$$$message_0662_0004_0000$$$::"...Saber."[lr]::
72031::$$$message_0662_0004_0001$$$::"........."[lr]::
72032::$$$message_0662_0004_0002$$$::She wouldn't have anything to say to me.::
72033::$$$message_0662_0005_0000$$$::Of course not.[lr]::
72034::$$$message_0662_0005_0001$$$::Saber's only job is to eliminate intruders.[lr]::
72035::$$$message_0662_0005_0002$$$::She's the gatekeeper and executioner here.[lr]::
72036::$$$message_0662_0005_0003$$$::She's the strongest Servant protecting Sakura, and she could take us both alone.::
72037::$$$message_0662_0006_0000$$$::"...Hmph. Doesn't look like we'll be able to talk our way through."[lr]::
72038::$$$message_0662_0006_0001$$$::Tohsaka arms herself with the Jeweled Sword she kept behind her waist, keeping her stance low.::
72039::$$$message_0662_0007_0000$$$::   She intends to attack from the front.[lr]::
72040::$$$message_0662_0007_0001$$$::I don't know what powers that sword has, but she seems to think it'll work in a clash against Saber.::
72041::$$$message_0662_0008_0000$$$::But it won't go well.[lr]::
72042::$$$message_0662_0008_0001$$$::I know Saber, so there are ways to deal with her. We shouldn't reveal our only secret weapon while Zouken and Assassin could still be waiting[line2]::
72043::$$$message_0662_0009_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, wait! Saber is[line2]"[lr]::
72044::$$$message_0662_0009_0001$$$::"Rin. I have no reason to fight you. Take care not to point that sword at me. I would be violating Sakura's orders if I killed you here."::
72045::$$$message_0662_0010_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
72046::$$$message_0662_0010_0001$$$::Saber's quiet voice is the same as ever. It stops Rin in her tracks.[lr]::
72047::$$$message_0662_0010_0002$$$::Tohsaka and I both know what that means.::
72048::$$$message_0662_0011_0000$$$::"...What do you mean? Aren't you the gatekeeper here, Saber?"[lr]::
72049::$$$message_0662_0011_0001$$$::"Yes. I will eliminate any who attempt to pass.[lr]::
72050::$$$message_0662_0011_0002$$$::That was Sakura's order. But..."[lr]::
72051::$$$message_0662_0011_0003$$$::"I'm an exception. She wants to see me?"[lr]::
72052::$$$message_0662_0011_0004$$$::Saber nods wordlessly.::
72053::$$$message_0662_0012_0000$$$::"...Okay. Sakura's serious, then."[lr]::
72054::$$$message_0662_0012_0001$$$::She murmurs briefly.[lr]::
72055::$$$message_0662_0012_0002$$$::After a big sigh, Tohsaka walks toward Saber.::
72056::$$$message_0662_0013_0000$$$::"Tohsaka."[lr]::
72057::$$$message_0662_0013_0001$$$::"Sorry. That's how it is, so I'm going on ahead."[lr]::
72058::$$$message_0662_0013_0002$$$::Tohsaka boldly walks past Saber.[lr]::
72059::$$$message_0662_0013_0003$$$::Just before she blends into the dark...::
72060::$$$message_0662_0014_0000$$$::"Shirou. I don't know what will happen to you, but I trust you. Make sure you live up to that."::
72061::$$$message_0662_0015_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
72062::$$$message_0662_0015_0001$$$::...Hold on.[lr]::
72063::$$$message_0662_0015_0002$$$::I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with that vague statement, not that my brain is working very well right now.::
72064::$$$message_0662_0016_0000$$$::"I-I'm saying that I don't want you to complain when you show up after everything's over! ...If you want to save Sakura, then don't take too long."[lr]::
72065::$$$message_0662_0016_0001$$$::Tohsaka's long hair whips through the air, and she disappears into the depths of the cave without looking back.::
72066::$$$message_0662_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72067::$$$message_0662_0017_0001$$$::...Thanks, Tohsaka.[lr]::
72068::$$$message_0662_0017_0002$$$::That boosted my spirits.[lr]::
72069::$$$message_0662_0017_0003$$$::In other words, telling me to come before she settles the score with Sakura was her roundabout way of cheering me on.::
72070::$$$message_0662_0018_0000$$$::"That is impossible. You will die here, Shirou."[lr]::
72071::$$$message_0662_0018_0001$$$::"...!"::
72072::$$$message_0662_0019_0000$$$::Saber's bloodlust swells.[lr]::
72073::$$$message_0662_0019_0001$$$::Tohsaka's gone, leaving only me.[lr]::
72074::$$$message_0662_0019_0002$$$::I suppose that in this situation, Saber doesn't need to hide her hostility anymore.::
72075::$$$message_0662_0020_0000$$$::"Did I hear you correctly? You said that you would only kill those who attempt to pass. If he stays here, you should not attack him."::
72076::$$$message_0662_0021_0000$$$::"If he stays there, yes.[lr]::
72077::$$$message_0662_0021_0001$$$::But he [font italic=true]will[font italic=false] try to pass. He knows he cannot beat me, but he still needs to go.[lr]::
72078::$$$message_0662_0021_0002$$$::Am I wrong, Rider?"[lr]::
72079::$$$message_0662_0021_0003$$$::"No, you did serve him once, Saber.[lr]::
72080::$$$message_0662_0021_0004$$$::You must be quite familiar with his character."::
72081::$$$message_0662_0022_0000$$$::...Saber narrows her eyes.[lr]::
72082::$$$message_0662_0022_0001$$$::She holds a black-dyed sacred sword in her hands.[lr]::
72083::$$$message_0662_0022_0002$$$::   She's coming.[lr]::
72084::$$$message_0662_0022_0003$$$::Me or Rider.[lr]::
72085::$$$message_0662_0022_0004$$$::If either of us take so much as a step forward, Saber will rush in to cut us down with a single blow.::
72086::$$$message_0662_0023_0000$$$::"...You won't let us pass, no matter what, Saber?"[lr]::
72087::$$$message_0662_0023_0001$$$::"Enough! I told you that this is my role now."[lr]::
72088::$$$message_0662_0023_0002$$$::I grasp the holy shroud covering my left arm.[lr]::
72089::$$$message_0662_0023_0003$$$::...Saber doesn't show a hint of doubt.[lr]::
72090::$$$message_0662_0023_0004$$$::We're enemies now.[lr]::
72091::$$$message_0662_0023_0005$$$::That's the undeniable truth that I saw for myself in the forest that night.::
72092::$$$message_0662_0024_0000$$$::And I answer...[lr]::
72093::$$$message_0662_0024_0001$$$::"...I see. Then we'll destroy you."[lr]::
72094::$$$message_0662_0024_0002$$$::I have to accept it.::
72095::$$$message_0662_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72096::$$$message_0662_0025_0001$$$::"I'm going to save Sakura. You're in the way."[lr]::
72097::$$$message_0662_0025_0002$$$::Saber isn't my only enemy.[lr]::
72098::$$$message_0662_0025_0003$$$::I still need to deal with Assassin and Zouken, who's responsible for all of this.[lr]::
72099::$$$message_0662_0025_0004$$$::I can't let this take up any more of our time.::
72100::$$$message_0662_0026_0000$$$::"Shirou, get behind me. I will engage Saber, as planned."[lr]::
72101::$$$message_0662_0026_0001$$$::Rider pushes me behind her while removing her blindfold.::
72102::$$$message_0662_0027_0000$$$::Saber raises her sword.[lr]::
72103::$$$message_0662_0027_0001$$$::   The tip of her sword is already keenly focused on Rider.::
72104::$$$message_0662_0028_0000$$$::"Don't be ridiculous. I said we'd take her together. Rider, you can't..."[lr]::
72105::$$$message_0662_0028_0001$$$::"I cannot defeat her, but I can suppress her. Fortunately, Saber has no attribute that protects against Mystic Eyes.[lr]::
72106::$$$message_0662_0028_0002$$$::I cannot petrify her because her magical energy exceeds mine, but I can weigh her down. I should be able to hold out against her for two minutes at maximum effort."::
72107::$$$message_0662_0029_0000$$$::Rider's eyes focus on Saber.[lr]::
72108::$$$message_0662_0029_0001$$$::They can turn everything they see to stone, and they can weaken Saber temporarily.::
72109::$$$message_0662_0030_0000$$$::"I will create an opportunity. Stay still and make sure you don't miss it."[lr]::
72110::$$$message_0662_0030_0001$$$::"Rider..."[lr]::
72111::$$$message_0662_0030_0002$$$::"I am off. My life is in your hands, Shirou."::
72112::$$$message_0662_0031_0000$$$::Rider vanishes.[lr]::
72113::$$$message_0662_0031_0001$$$::She charges the dark knight at extreme speed, raising a gust of wind.::
72114::$$$message_0662_0032_0000$$$::Human eyesight can't even perceive Rider's godlike speed.[lr]::
72115::$$$message_0662_0032_0001$$$::Saber casually knocks her back.::
72116::$$$message_0662_0033_0000$$$::"Very well. I'll erase you first, Rider."[lr]::
72117::$$$message_0662_0033_0001$$$::An enormous pressure suffuses the cave.[lr]::
72118::$$$message_0662_0033_0002$$$::The black swordsman smiles coldly, and calmly begins to move.::
