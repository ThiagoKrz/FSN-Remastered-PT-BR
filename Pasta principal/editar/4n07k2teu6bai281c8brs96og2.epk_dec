59397::$$$message_0539_0000_0000$$$::"Ngh, hah!"[lr]::
59398::$$$message_0539_0000_0001$$$::I step towards Zouken and swing the kyousaku stick with all my strength.[lr]::
59399::$$$message_0539_0000_0002$$$::I aim a vertical slash from skull to groin,[lr]::
59400::$$$message_0539_0000_0003$$$::but something repels it, immediately sending me flying backward.::
59401::$$$message_0539_0001_0000$$$::"Argh!"[lr]::
59402::$$$message_0539_0001_0001$$$::My back slams into a wall.[lr]::
59403::$$$message_0539_0001_0002$$$::I can't breathe, like someone punched the wind out of me.[lr]::
59404::$$$message_0539_0001_0003$$$::My back feels numb where it hit the wall, like when you get too close to a fire.::
59405::$$$message_0539_0002_0000$$$::I hear bugs near my ear.[lr]::
59406::$$$message_0539_0002_0001$$$::The bugs coating the wall moved so that they wouldn't be crushed when I hit it.[lr]::
59407::$$$message_0539_0002_0002$$$::...Even their chittering seems to taunt me.::
59408::$$$message_0539_0003_0000$$$::"You made it back in time, Assassin. I'll let you dispose of the boy. It should be an easy job compared to Saber, so take your time and enjoy it."::
59409::$$$message_0539_0004_0000$$$::Zouken disappears.[lr]::
59410::$$$message_0539_0004_0001$$$::In the darkness where he lurked,[lr]::
59411::$$$message_0539_0004_0002$$$::a white skull snickers at me.::
59412::$$$message_0539_0005_0000$$$::...So that's the Assassin Servant.[lr]::
59413::$$$message_0539_0005_0001$$$::He's a black-robed killer with a white mask that suits Zouken well.::
59414::$$$message_0539_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59415::$$$message_0539_0006_0001$$$::He's going to kill me.[lr]::
59416::$$$message_0539_0006_0002$$$::My left hand hurts.[lr]::
59417::$$$message_0539_0006_0003$$$::I can barely think.[lr]::
59418::$$$message_0539_0006_0004$$$::My heartbeat reaches a fever pitch, realizing these are my last moments.[lr]::
59419::$$$message_0539_0006_0005$$$::Assassin hurls lethal weapons at my groin, throat, heart, and stomach, and I have no way to stop them.::
59420::$$$message_0539_0006_0006$$$::Silver light repels the incoming attack.[lr]::
59421::$$$message_0539_0006_0007$$$::A blade bats aside all four daggers that were about to kill me.::
59422::$$$message_0539_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59423::$$$message_0539_0007_0001$$$::Only one person could have done that.[lr]::
59424::$$$message_0539_0007_0002$$$::My left hand still hurts.[lr]::
59425::$$$message_0539_0007_0003$$$::My Command Spells aren't gone yet.[lr]::
59426::$$$message_0539_0007_0004$$$::That means...::
59427::$$$message_0539_0008_0000$$$::"Saber!"[lr]::
59428::$$$message_0539_0008_0001$$$::"Did you fail to finish her, you fool!?"::
59429::$$$message_0539_0009_0000$$$::I look up.[lr]::
59430::$$$message_0539_0009_0001$$$::Someone appears as if to protect me from the white-masked Servant, but it's...[lr]::
59431::$$$message_0539_0009_0002$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
59432::$$$message_0539_0009_0003$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
59433::$$$message_0539_0009_0004$$$::Another Servant in dark clothes, like Assassin.::
59434::$$$message_0539_0010_0000$$$::"Rider...?"[lr]::
59435::$$$message_0539_0010_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59436::$$$message_0539_0010_0002$$$::There's no doubt about it.[lr]::
59437::$$$message_0539_0010_0003$$$::That's Shinji's Servant, Rider.[lr]::
59438::$$$message_0539_0010_0004$$$::Why is she here to help me?::
59439::$$$message_0539_0011_0000$$$::"You would dare disobey me!? Damn it. They mean nothing to me, Assassin! Kill all who would stand in my way!"[lr]::
59440::$$$message_0539_0011_0001$$$::The skull answers Zouken's shout.::
59441::$$$message_0539_0012_0000$$$::Her long hair traces through the air.[lr]::
59442::$$$message_0539_0012_0001$$$::Rider wordlessly turns toward Assassin,[lr]::
59443::$$$message_0539_0012_0002$$$::facing the rain of daggers he unleashes.::
59444::$$$message_0539_0013_0000$$$::   I can't follow the daggers with my eyes.::
59445::$$$message_0539_0014_0000$$$::The skull mask bounds and scrambles around the cramped shrine room.[lr]::
59446::$$$message_0539_0014_0001$$$::As soon as I spot him on the walls, he's on the ceiling, then the floor, throwing one dagger after another.[lr]::
59447::$$$message_0539_0014_0002$$$::They come from every direction without end, giving their target no chance to block or evade them all.::
59448::$$$message_0539_0015_0000$$$::In the blink of an eye, the volley of daggers lines the floor like a sharp forest.[lr]::
59449::$$$message_0539_0015_0001$$$::Rider can't deal with that.[lr]::
59450::$$$message_0539_0015_0002$$$::I've seen her move when she fought Saber.[lr]::
59451::$$$message_0539_0015_0003$$$::Assassin's assault was probably fierce enough to keep Saber at bay.[lr]::
59452::$$$message_0539_0015_0004$$$::But she beat Rider in a single blow, so Rider has no chance.::
59453::$$$message_0539_0016_0000$$$::The white skull hurls a merciless barrage of darts.[lr]::
59454::$$$message_0539_0016_0001$$$::   But then, I notice...[lr]::
59455::$$$message_0539_0016_0002$$$::Something like frustration behind his attacks.::
59456::$$$message_0539_0017_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
59457::$$$message_0539_0017_0001$$$::By the time I realize what's wrong, the difference in power is already clear.[lr]::
59458::$$$message_0539_0017_0002$$$::...They aren't hitting her.[lr]::
59459::$$$message_0539_0017_0003$$$::Not a single one of the dozens of daggers from the shadows even scratches Rider.::
59460::$$$message_0539_0018_0000$$$::"daMN YoU..."[lr]::
59461::$$$message_0539_0018_0001$$$::The voice comes from the ceiling.[lr]::
59462::$$$message_0539_0018_0002$$$::Assassin glares hatefully at his foe. Maybe he ran out of daggers.[lr]::
59463::$$$message_0539_0018_0003$$$::There...::
59464::$$$message_0539_0019_0000$$$::                                              is a gigantic snake.::
59465::$$$message_0539_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59466::$$$message_0539_0020_0001$$$::...I don't believe it.[lr]::
59467::$$$message_0539_0020_0002$$$::That many daggers.[lr]::
59468::$$$message_0539_0020_0003$$$::Rider evaded them all with pure speed.::
59469::$$$message_0539_0021_0000$$$::It's not like when she saved me, moments earlier.[lr]::
59470::$$$message_0539_0021_0001$$$::She simply raced around on the ground, as if to declare that she didn't even need to block the daggers to defend herself.::
59471::$$$message_0539_0022_0000$$$::"What are you playing at, Assassin!? There's no need to show mercy against my grandchild's Servant! Hurry up and take care of this!"[lr]::
59472::$$$message_0539_0022_0001$$$::"I CAN'T Do tHAt. she'S dIFFerENt tHaN BefoRe."::
59473::$$$message_0539_0023_0000$$$::Assassin eyes Rider dubiously from the ceiling.[lr]::
59474::$$$message_0539_0023_0001$$$::Rider is different from the Servant I witnessed before.[lr]::
59475::$$$message_0539_0023_0002$$$::The magical energy in her body and the sheer physical prowess are on a totally different level.[lr]::
59476::$$$message_0539_0023_0003$$$::She might not be as strong as Saber, but she's clearly superior to Assassin.::
59477::$$$message_0539_0024_0000$$$::"Kh... How..."[lr]::
59478::$$$message_0539_0024_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59479::$$$message_0539_0024_0002$$$::Rider doesn't answer.[lr]::
59480::$$$message_0539_0024_0003$$$::She just crouches low.::
59481::$$$message_0539_0025_0000$$$::Just as I realize it's the posture of a predator about to pounce on its prey,::
59482::$$$message_0539_0025_0001$$$::Rider flies up at the ceiling while Assassin leaps at the ground, and they cross blades.::
59483::$$$message_0539_0026_0000$$$::"Keh!"[lr]::
59484::$$$message_0539_0026_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59485::$$$message_0539_0026_0002$$$::Both fighters clash their daggers and land, facing away from each other.[lr]::
59486::$$$message_0539_0026_0003$$$::Rider is unharmed.[lr]::
59487::$$$message_0539_0026_0004$$$::Meanwhile, Assassin's shoulder is skewered by one of her daggers.::
59488::$$$message_0539_0027_0000$$$::"Heh. Fool[line2]ngh!?"[lr]::
59489::$$$message_0539_0027_0001$$$::Assassin attempts to pull out the dagger in his shoulder.::
59490::$$$message_0539_0028_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59491::$$$message_0539_0028_0001$$$::Before he can, a metallic sound[lr]::
59492::$$$message_0539_0028_0002$$$::of chains rings out, and Rider...::
59493::$$$message_0539_0028_0003$$$::"Eh? Whaaaaa!?"[lr]::
59494::$$$message_0539_0028_0004$$$::...uses her chains to bodily swing Assassin around!::
59495::$$$message_0539_0029_0000$$$::"Gah, geeeeeh!"[lr]::
59496::$$$message_0539_0029_0001$$$::The skull shrieks in pain.[lr]::
59497::$$$message_0539_0029_0002$$$::Rider just keeps spinning him around mercilessly.::
59498::$$$message_0539_0030_0000$$$::Like she's swinging a ball and chain.[lr]::
59499::$$$message_0539_0030_0001$$$::Assassin flails through the room helplessly, crashing through walls, his arms and legs bending at wrong angles with each impact.::
59500::$$$message_0539_0031_0000$$$::"Whoa, watch it!"[lr]::
59501::$$$message_0539_0031_0001$$$::I duck to avoid the whirling man-tornado.::
59502::$$$message_0539_0032_0000$$$::"Gah! Kah! Gah!"[lr]::
59503::$$$message_0539_0032_0001$$$::It can't be described as merely "powerful" or "violent."[lr]::
59504::$$$message_0539_0032_0002$$$::After spinning him around as she pleases, she lets the centrifugal force carry him and lets go.[lr]::
59505::$$$message_0539_0032_0003$$$::It's like throwing a sledgehammer.::
59506::$$$message_0539_0033_0000$$$::Assassin, his bones shattered, is thrown through the last wall headfirst...::
59507::$$$message_0539_0034_0000$$$::"Ah."[lr]::
59508::$$$message_0539_0034_0001$$$::...and goes flying.[lr]::
59509::$$$message_0539_0034_0002$$$::The skull-masked Servant is tossed out into the temple yard like a piece of trash, bounces off the ground a few times spattering blood everywhere, and finally rolls to a stop at the mountain gate.::
59510::$$$message_0539_0035_0000$$$::"Ah...wow..."[lr]::
59511::$$$message_0539_0035_0001$$$::...That was brutal.[lr]::
59512::$$$message_0539_0035_0002$$$::I know by now that Servants don't die that easily, but he probably can't fight anymore.::
59513::$$$message_0539_0036_0000$$$::"You fool..."[lr]::
59514::$$$message_0539_0036_0001$$$::Zouken's presence fades.[lr]::
59515::$$$message_0539_0036_0002$$$::Sensing the tables turning, the old mage departs with a harsh word for Rider,[lr]::
59516::$$$message_0539_0036_0003$$$::and the bugs that were cowering in the corners of the room leave with their master.::
