36884::$$$message_0312_0000_0000$$$::"Oh. I think they're having a sale at the shopping district today."[lr]::
36885::$$$message_0312_0000_0001$$$::...Hm.[lr]::
36886::$$$message_0312_0000_0002$$$::Saber is looking forward to dinner, so it might not be a bad idea to splurge and make it a fancy dinner.[lr]::
36887::$$$message_0312_0000_0003$$$::I can just report to Tohsaka once I get home.::
36888::$$$message_0312_0001_0000$$$::"...I just bought some beef filet."::
36889::$$$message_0312_0002_0000$$$::And veal too. It's rare, expensive, and doesn't taste that different, but boy did I fall for the butcher's sales pitch hook, line, and sinker!::
36890::$$$message_0312_0003_0000$$$::"Oh well. It was pretty cheap."[lr]::
36891::$$$message_0312_0003_0001$$$::I can just look at it as a day's worth of earnings, I guess.[lr]::
36892::$$$message_0312_0003_0002$$$::Saber looks like she'd like something like this. We've been having homemade meals, so I'm sure she would be happy if I make something like a Western-style full-course meal.::
36893::$$$message_0312_0004_0000$$$::"...It'd be perfect if I could prepare appetizers, desserts, and cheese, but it'd be hard on my wallet.[lr]::
36894::$$$message_0312_0004_0001$$$::Saber is fine, but if I even made Fuji-nee a gourmet meal, then later on it'd be...?"::
36895::$$$message_0312_0005_0000$$$::Something unfamiliar caught the corner of my eye.[lr]::
36896::$$$message_0312_0005_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
36897::$$$message_0312_0005_0002$$$::I wonder what it is and look back at the cake shop, Fleur.::
36898::$$$message_0312_0006_0000$$$::...Is that some kind of uniform?[lr]::
36899::$$$message_0312_0006_0001$$$::A woman in an outfit unfit for this antique shopping district looks like she's giving the lady at the local cake shop some trouble.::
36900::$$$message_0312_0007_0000$$$::...I get curious and stop.[lr]::
36901::$$$message_0312_0007_0001$$$::From what I overheard, it seemed like the money that the woman in white is trying to pay with is not Japanese yen, so the lady in the cake shop doesn't seem to know what to do.[lr]::
36902::$$$message_0312_0007_0002$$$::The out-of-place woman is also speaking in broken Japanese.::
36903::$$$message_0312_0008_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
36904::$$$message_0312_0008_0001$$$::...Well, I got a bargain.[lr]::
36905::$$$message_0312_0008_0002$$$::I guess I'll do something about it since I happened to pass by.::
36906::$$$message_0312_0009_0000$$$::"Thank you!"[lr]::
36907::$$$message_0312_0009_0001$$$::I'm thanked two-fold and leave the cake shop.::
36908::$$$message_0312_0010_0000$$$::"...Thanks. You helped me with the cake."[lr]::
36909::$$$message_0312_0010_0001$$$::The girl also thanks me in broken Japanese.[lr]::
36910::$$$message_0312_0010_0002$$$::But, I really haven't done much.[lr]::
36911::$$$message_0312_0010_0003$$$::All I did was exchange her foreign currency with my two thousand yen bills.::
36912::$$$message_0312_0011_0000$$$::"...Change. Left over. You can have it."[lr]::
36913::$$$message_0312_0011_0001$$$::"Huh? No, I got enough already. You gave me two ten franc notes."::
36914::$$$message_0312_0012_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
36915::$$$message_0312_0012_0001$$$::This Nightingale-esque clad woman looks around absent-mindedly.::
36916::$$$message_0312_0013_0000$$$::"...I'm already done shopping. Goodbye."[lr]::
36917::$$$message_0312_0013_0001$$$::She bows and leaves.[lr]::
36918::$$$message_0312_0013_0002$$$::I watch the girl leave, thinking to myself that there are days like this.::
36919::$$$message_0312_0014_0000$$$::Then...[lr]::
36920::$$$message_0312_0014_0001$$$::"Oh yeah. Do you like cake?"[lr]::
36921::$$$message_0312_0014_0002$$$::I get curious and ask her.::
36922::$$$message_0312_0015_0000$$$::The girl in white stops and after looking around absent-mindedly...[lr]::
36923::$$$message_0312_0015_0001$$$::"...Yes. And Sella has common tastes."[lr]::
36924::$$$message_0312_0015_0002$$$::She gives a vague answer.::
36925::$$$message_0312_0016_0000$$$::I check the school directory as soon as I get home and call Tohsaka's.[lr]::
36926::$$$message_0312_0016_0001$$$::The phone rings.[lr]::
36927::$$$message_0312_0016_0002$$$::After calling dozens of times, right before I'm ready to give up, she picks up.::
36928::$$$message_0312_0017_0000$$$::"Yes, this is Tohsaka."[lr]::
36929::$$$message_0312_0017_0001$$$::The voice on the other end is definitely Tohsaka's.::
36930::$$$message_0312_0018_0000$$$::"Hello? It's Emiya. Do you have time right now?"[lr]::
36931::$$$message_0312_0018_0001$$$::"Huh? Stop fooling around, Ar[line2]Wait, no way, is it actually you...!?"[lr]::
36932::$$$message_0312_0018_0002$$$::"...Hey. I don't have the free time to be playing around with you."::
36933::$$$message_0312_0019_0000$$$::"Oh... No, that's not it... Sorry, I was just a little surprised. Did something happen for you to call?"::
36934::$$$message_0312_0020_0000$$$::"It's about Issei. I promised you that I would get it cleared up today. Issei wasn't a Master. He didn't have a Command Spell anywhere, so there's no doubt."::
36935::$$$message_0312_0021_0000$$$::"Really? ...I'm surprised that you actually looked into it today. So Issei is innocent, huh? ...Well, we're out of leads now, but I guess that's fine."[lr]::
36936::$$$message_0312_0021_0001$$$::I can't tell whether she's disappointed or relieved. I can't grasp Tohsaka's reaction that well through the phone.::
36937::$$$message_0312_0022_0000$$$::"Anyway, good work. We'll think about what to do about the search for the Master tomorrow. So is that all? If so, I have to go."[lr]::
36938::$$$message_0312_0022_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
36939::$$$message_0312_0022_0002$$$::I don't have anything else to say.[lr]::
36940::$$$message_0312_0022_0003$$$::But, there is one other thing that bothers me.::
36941::$$$message_0312_0023_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. You seemed surprised earlier. Did something happen?"[lr]::
36942::$$$message_0312_0023_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36943::$$$message_0312_0023_0002$$$::I can feel Tohsaka's bewilderment through the phone.[lr]::
36944::$$$message_0312_0023_0003$$$::After a brief moment of silence...::
36945::$$$message_0312_0024_0000$$$::"...Nothing. I just got surprised since your voice just sounded a bit different over the phone."[lr]::
36946::$$$message_0312_0024_0001$$$::She states the obvious in a cold voice and hangs up.:yҲ
