31744::$$$message_0255_0000_0000$$$::"It's cold."[lr]::
31745::$$$message_0255_0000_0001$$$::The rooftop is mercilessly cold.[lr]::
31746::$$$message_0255_0000_0002$$$::It would be crowded with students enjoying the breeze during the summer, but it's as desolate as a shopping district on New Years during the winter.::
31747::$$$message_0255_0001_0000$$$::"It's cold."[lr]::
31748::$$$message_0255_0001_0001$$$::I say it one more time.[lr]::
31749::$$$message_0255_0001_0002$$$::Though it's an honest opinion, I'd really just like the person next to me to take the hint.[lr]::
31750::$$$message_0255_0001_0003$$$::"W-what? Suck it up if you're a man."[lr]::
31751::$$$message_0255_0001_0004$$$::My objection is shot down right away.::
31752::$$$message_0255_0002_0000$$$::"Over here, Emiya. It isn't as windy and we won't be seen."[lr]::
31753::$$$message_0255_0002_0001$$$::She quickly moves to her destination and doesn't make eye contact.::
31754::$$$message_0255_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31755::$$$message_0255_0003_0001$$$::I eat my lunch.[lr]::
31756::$$$message_0255_0003_0002$$$::She must've called me over since she had something to talk about, but she doesn't speak up at all.::
31757::$$$message_0255_0004_0000$$$::Even so...[lr]::
31758::$$$message_0255_0004_0001$$$::When I sneak a peek at her, she's looking at me as if she wants to say something.::
31759::$$$message_0255_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31760::$$$message_0255_0005_0001$$$::I keep eating my lunch.[lr]::
31761::$$$message_0255_0005_0002$$$::There's nothing else I can do to keep my cool.[lr]::
31762::$$$message_0255_0005_0003$$$::At this point I don't care that it's cold or quiet.::
31763::$$$message_0255_0006_0000$$$::It's just...[lr]::
31764::$$$message_0255_0006_0001$$$::This is making me anxious.[lr]::
31765::$$$message_0255_0006_0002$$$::Since the places where we can avoid the wind are limited, Tohsaka is eating her bread right next to me.[lr]::
31766::$$$message_0255_0006_0003$$$::We're so close that if I move my body even just a little, our shoulders will rub.[lr]::
31767::$$$message_0255_0006_0004$$$::Doesn't it look like we're eating lunch, like, [font italic=true]together[font italic=false] from the outside?::
31768::$$$message_0255_0007_0000$$$::"Ungh..."[lr]::
31769::$$$message_0255_0007_0001$$$::I try my best to keep from blushing.[lr]::
31770::$$$message_0255_0007_0002$$$::...Damn it.[lr]::
31771::$$$message_0255_0007_0003$$$::Why didn't it occur to me when she invited me in the hallway?::
31772::$$$message_0255_0008_0000$$$::It's only natural that I can't keep it together.[lr]::
31773::$$$message_0255_0008_0001$$$::Though she's my ally now, I've admired her for quite some time.[lr]::
31774::$$$message_0255_0008_0002$$$::...Well, I can't say this to Tohsaka since she would just laugh it off, but man, I wish she happened to be more considerate to a case like that.::
31775::$$$message_0255_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31776::$$$message_0255_0009_0001$$$::My chopsticks hit the bottom of my lunchbox.[lr]::
31777::$$$message_0255_0009_0002$$$::...Finished.[lr]::
31778::$$$message_0255_0009_0003$$$::All that's left is to clean up after myself.[lr]::
31779::$$$message_0255_0009_0004$$$::It seems like Tohsaka finished a while ago, as she is watching me idly.::
31780::$$$message_0255_0010_0000$$$::...Man.[lr]::
31781::$$$message_0255_0010_0001$$$::Lunch break is going to end in a few minutes.[lr]::
31782::$$$message_0255_0010_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31783::$$$message_0255_0010_0003$$$::I guess I'll just have to ask her what we'll do after school today...::
31784::$$$message_0255_0011_0000$$$::We speak up simultaneously.[lr]::
31785::$$$message_0255_0011_0001$$$::Our eyes finally meet for the first time today.::
31786::$$$message_0255_0012_0000$$$::We talk at the exact same moment again and look away in embarrassment.::
31787::$$$message_0255_0013_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][r]::
31788::$$$message_0255_0013_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31789::$$$message_0255_0013_0002$$$::Silence follows.[lr]::
31790::$$$message_0255_0013_0003$$$::The end of lunch break is nearing.[lr]::
31791::$$$message_0255_0013_0004$$$::I'm relieved and disappointed that we might have to go now.::
31792::$$$message_0255_0014_0000$$$::   Then...[lr]::
31793::$$$message_0255_0014_0001$$$::"...Um, sorry about last night."[lr]::
31794::$$$message_0255_0014_0002$$$::Tohsaka murmurs in an apologetic voice.::
31795::$$$message_0255_0015_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
31796::$$$message_0255_0015_0001$$$::"I said about yesterday. I used a Command Spell on Archer... I know it's late, but sorry."::
31797::$$$message_0255_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31798::$$$message_0255_0016_0001$$$::My frivolous thoughts pause.[lr]::
31799::$$$message_0255_0016_0002$$$::...What happened last night...[lr]::
31800::$$$message_0255_0016_0003$$$::Archer tried to kill me, and Tohsaka says she used a Command Spell on him.::
31801::$$$message_0255_0017_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. So, that means..."[lr]::
31802::$$$message_0255_0017_0001$$$::"...Yes. As long as we're allies, I ordered him not to attack you with a Command Spell. So from now on, something like yesterday won't happen again."[lr]::
31803::$$$message_0255_0017_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31804::$$$message_0255_0017_0003$$$::...That [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] a relief.[lr]::
31805::$$$message_0255_0017_0004$$$::It's a relief, but Tohsaka used a Command Spell on something like that?::
31806::$$$message_0255_0018_0000$$$::"I see. But, that's nothing for you to apologize for.[lr]::
31807::$$$message_0255_0018_0001$$$::That is something he did on his own. You didn't know what he was doing either, right?"::
31808::$$$message_0255_0019_0000$$$::"...Yeah. But, that doesn't mean I have nothing to do with it. It's my responsibility as Master for letting him do as he pleases."[lr]::
31809::$$$message_0255_0019_0001$$$::She looks down, dejected.[lr]::
31810::$$$message_0255_0019_0002$$$::This is really unlike her. It bothers me more than the fact that I got attacked by Archer.::
31811::$$$message_0255_0020_0000$$$::"All right. I'll say that's the case if you say so.[lr]::
31812::$$$message_0255_0020_0001$$$::But I'm surprised Archer actually told you. I would never think that he would actually report to you that he attacked me."::
31813::$$$message_0255_0021_0000$$$::"...Yeah. But it's obvious something happened if your Servant comes home wounded with no magical energy.[lr]::
31814::$$$message_0255_0021_0001$$$::He hides things, but he doesn't lie. He readily confessed when I asked him what happened."::
31815::$$$message_0255_0022_0000$$$::"Oh, you're back to normal. That's good, it's not like you if you're like that."[lr]::
31816::$$$message_0255_0022_0001$$$::"Mrgh... Hey, what does that mean?"[lr]::
31817::$$$message_0255_0022_0002$$$::"Don't worry about it. So where's Archer?"::
31818::$$$message_0255_0023_0000$$$::"I left him at home. He's been acting strange since last night, and I don't want to have him see you after what happened yesterday."[lr]::
31819::$$$message_0255_0023_0001$$$::Yeah, I don't want to see him either.[lr]::
31820::$$$message_0255_0023_0002$$$:: It's obvious we would just end up insulting each other if we saw each other.::
31821::$$$message_0255_0024_0000$$$::"...Okay. But Tohsaka, why did he attack me?"::
31822::$$$message_0255_0025_0000$$$::"...He said the fewer enemies, the better.[lr]::
31823::$$$message_0255_0025_0001$$$::Something about how he didn't care about you, but he has to defeat Saber because she'll get in the way later on.[lr]::
31824::$$$message_0255_0025_0002$$$::He thought it was bothersome how easily you got manipulated by another Master, so he decided to kill you."::
31825::$$$message_0255_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31826::$$$message_0255_0026_0001$$$::Damn it, I can't object to that.[lr]::
31827::$$$message_0255_0026_0002$$$::I'm certainly burdensome, falling into Caster's trap like that.[lr]::
31828::$$$message_0255_0026_0003$$$::He must've figured that the moment I was caught in her spell.::
31829::$$$message_0255_0027_0000$$$::"I got it. I don't want to harp on this too much. It was partially my fault as well, and in any case, I don't know what would've happened if he hadn't come.[lr]::
31830::$$$message_0255_0027_0001$$$::See, it evens out in the end. Don't feel bad about it."::
31831::$$$message_0255_0028_0000$$$::"...Yeah, it means a lot if you say so."[lr]::
31832::$$$message_0255_0028_0001$$$::She looks away awkwardly.[lr]::
31833::$$$message_0255_0028_0002$$$::That strong sense of responsibility must be getting in the way of her agreeability. ::
31834::$$$message_0255_0029_0000$$$::"Oh, the bell rang just in time."[lr]::
31835::$$$message_0255_0029_0001$$$::Lunch break is over.[lr]::
31836::$$$message_0255_0029_0002$$$::I didn't even taste anything because of the situation, but I guess this wasn't bad at all.::
31837::$$$message_0255_0030_0000$$$::"Let's get back inside. We'll be late for fifth period."[lr]::
31838::$$$message_0255_0030_0001$$$::I stand up and head to the door.[lr]::
31839::$$$message_0255_0030_0002$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
31840::$$$message_0255_0030_0003$$$::But, Tohsaka is still sitting.::
31841::$$$message_0255_0031_0000$$$::"Tohsaka? The bell rang."[lr]::
31842::$$$message_0255_0031_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
31843::$$$message_0255_0031_0002$$$::She doesn't answer, but she looks at me as though she wants to say something.[lr]::
31844::$$$message_0255_0031_0003$$$::"Keep me company for a bit. It's all right to skip one class, right?"[lr]::
31845::$$$message_0255_0031_0004$$$::The words a model honor student would never dare say.::
31846::$$$message_0255_0032_0000$$$::The bell rings to indicate the start of fifth period.[lr]::
31847::$$$message_0255_0032_0001$$$::Yet, what are we doing...[lr]::
31848::$$$message_0255_0032_0002$$$::Drinking coffee at a place like this?::
31849::$$$message_0255_0033_0000$$$::...On a side note, I had to go buy the canned coffee real quicklike. [lr]::
31850::$$$message_0255_0033_0001$$$::"There's still five minutes until class starts right? I think that's enough time to go down to the store on the first floor from here."[lr]::
31851::$$$message_0255_0033_0002$$$::So was the devilish request from Tohsaka.::
31852::$$$message_0255_0034_0000$$$::"And how about you?"[lr]::
31853::$$$message_0255_0034_0001$$$::"Huh...? Oh, when I started learning magecraft? Yeah, I think that's about right. I begged my old man for something like two years, and he finally taught me."::
31854::$$$message_0255_0035_0000$$$::"So, nearly eight years... Your father sure did an incomplete job. If he was going to teach you, he should've taught you since you were born.[lr]::
31855::$$$message_0255_0035_0001$$$::You'd have already hit a growth spurt eight years ago. From that point, he wouldn't have been able to engrave a crest on you, or tamper with your body."::
31856::$$$message_0255_0036_0000$$$::Tohsaka says dangerous things.[lr]::
31857::$$$message_0255_0036_0001$$$::Well, I know this is the part of her that's a mage.::
31858::$$$message_0255_0037_0000$$$::"I guess. Like I said before, my old man never intended to teach me magecraft. So that's why he didn't go through the proper steps like you did.[lr]::
31859::$$$message_0255_0037_0001$$$::...Wait, what do you mean by doing something when you're born?"::
31860::$$$message_0255_0038_0000$$$::"...Um, it's just how it sounds. The longer the history, the larger the family's Magic Crest gets.[lr]::
31861::$$$message_0255_0038_0001$$$::A Magic Crest is a Magic Circuit given form. The moment you try to engrave it on a human host, their body attempts to reject it. And it seriously hurts.[lr]::
31862::$$$message_0255_0038_0002$$$::So, we transplant it little by little from when we're young to minimize the pain. We also ingest this powder made from bitter herbs and strange bones to create resistance within our body."::
31863::$$$message_0255_0039_0000$$$::"...Well, you don't have to worry about it since it doesn't concern you as a mage. It would be all sorts of trouble if you tried to copy it now."::
31864::$$$message_0255_0040_0000$$$::"I don't intend to.[lr]::
31865::$$$message_0255_0040_0001$$$::But are you okay? It sounds painful just hearing about it."[lr]::
31866::$$$message_0255_0040_0002$$$::...I don't know how to explain it.::
31867::$$$message_0255_0041_0000$$$::I've never known a "normal" practitioner of magecraft.[lr]::
31868::$$$message_0255_0041_0001$$$::But when I went to Tohsaka's house, I felt an inexplicable pressure.::
31869::$$$message_0255_0042_0000$$$::A family that passes along a long history...[lr]::
31870::$$$message_0255_0042_0001$$$::Children that have the duty to succeed since they were born, secluded from the normal world, completely disregarding anything they may want...[lr]::
31871::$$$message_0255_0042_0002$$$::I bite my lip, daring to imagine how painstaking and tiresome that must be.::
31872::$$$message_0255_0043_0000$$$::"Ooh. I see, so you're worried about things like that?"[lr]::
31873::$$$message_0255_0043_0001$$$::"...Ugh. W-what's up with that look? I'm not worried or anything."::
31874::$$$message_0255_0044_0000$$$::"Of course not. There's nothing to be worried about. I'm doing this because I want to, so I don't regret it at all. Isn't it the same for you?"[lr]::
31875::$$$message_0255_0044_0001$$$::"Mm...? Why are you asking me?"[lr]::
31876::$$$message_0255_0044_0002$$$::Wait, the same? Tohsaka and I?::
31877::$$$message_0255_0045_0000$$$::"...Geez. You really lack some self-awareness, you know.[lr]::
31878::$$$message_0255_0045_0001$$$::Look, my training was certainly tougher. But I've never thought about running away from it. I'm saying it must be the same for you."[lr]::
31879::$$$message_0255_0045_0002$$$::"Oh... Yeah. That's true, but I was never asked to do anything as hard as what you were doing."::
31880::$$$message_0255_0046_0000$$$::"Don't be ridiculous. It's not sane to start learning magecraft after living a normal life for nine years.[lr]::
31881::$$$message_0255_0046_0001$$$::...I don't know what your daily routine was like, but it must've been dangerous. Like you were living on the edge and would lose your life if you failed."::
31882::$$$message_0255_0047_0000$$$::"Oh... No, since I'm an amateur, it's not supposed to be [font italic=true]that[font italic=false] dangerous. It won't even compare to what you went through, Tohsaka."::
31883::$$$message_0255_0048_0000$$$::"I suppose. I can't compare myself to you either.[lr]::
31884::$$$message_0255_0048_0001$$$::...Training in magecraft is like that. The only common thing is that we're putting our life on a scale.[lr]::
31885::$$$message_0255_0048_0002$$$::It varies how much we dedicate to it, so how much we're willing to risk differs."::
31886::$$$message_0255_0049_0000$$$::"In that sense, your training is a lot more harsh than mine.[lr]::
31887::$$$message_0255_0049_0001$$$::I've never trained in a way that might kill me. First of all, I don't fail."[lr]::
31888::$$$message_0255_0049_0002$$$::"...Wow. You actually went there."::
31889::$$$message_0255_0050_0000$$$::She casually dunks on me.[lr]::
31890::$$$message_0255_0050_0001$$$::Tohsaka basically said that she doesn't know what it feels like to fail...unlike the rest of us.::
31891::$$$message_0255_0051_0000$$$::"Hey, why the long face? I just gave you a compliment."[lr]::
31892::$$$message_0255_0051_0001$$$::"Hmph. I don't exactly feel thrilled being told I did well this time from someone who always gets perfect scores."::
31893::$$$message_0255_0052_0000$$$::"I don't just mean right now.[lr]::
31894::$$$message_0255_0052_0001$$$::My point is, it's true that the training was hard, but it wasn't painful. That's why I didn't quit, and I'm still working on it. That's the same for you, right?"::
31895::$$$message_0255_0053_0000$$$::"Hm..."[lr]::
31896::$$$message_0255_0053_0001$$$::Hard but not painful.[lr]::
31897::$$$message_0255_0053_0002$$$::...I do think that's like what I feel.[lr]::
31898::$$$message_0255_0053_0003$$$::I never felt that it was painful or hard.[lr]::
31899::$$$message_0255_0053_0004$$$::No, to be honest, I couldn't afford to think that.[lr]::
31900::$$$message_0255_0053_0005$$$::I just wanted to catch up to Kiritsugu.::
31901::$$$message_0255_0054_0000$$$::I'll become like Kiritsugu some day.[lr]::
31902::$$$message_0255_0054_0001$$$::I've kept training to become the hero of justice that Kiritsugu couldn't.[lr]::
31903::$$$message_0255_0054_0002$$$::Looking back, most of my memories are about the training I did in the shed.[lr]::
31904::$$$message_0255_0054_0003$$$::I've never regretted that.[lr]::
31905::$$$message_0255_0054_0004$$$::Perhaps it's because I believed that that was the most important thing to do for myself.::
31906::$$$message_0255_0055_0000$$$::"...I see. I haven't really thought of it like that. I guess it means I've done my share too, huh?"[lr]::
31907::$$$message_0255_0055_0001$$$::That's right. You've come this far being self-taught, so you should have more confidence in yourself.::
31908::$$$message_0255_0056_0000$$$::Tohsaka says proudly.[lr]::
31909::$$$message_0255_0056_0001$$$::...I'm a bit embarrassed.[lr]::
31910::$$$message_0255_0056_0002$$$::It's worse when she's happy about it as if it's her own accomplishment.::
31911::$$$message_0255_0057_0000$$$::"Let's talk shop now that we got that clear. We have to know each other's strengths if we're going to be allies."[lr]::
31912::$$$message_0255_0057_0001$$$::"Strengths...? Oh, the magecraft that we can use. Isn't it late for that? You already know what I can do."::
31913::$$$message_0255_0058_0000$$$::"Yes, your magecraft is Strengthening, right?[lr]::
31914::$$$message_0255_0058_0001$$$::I won't go as far as saying that's rare, but there aren't that many mages that use it as their primary field. I've been wondering, but why are you particular about Strengthening?"::
31915::$$$message_0255_0059_0000$$$::"Well, that's the only thing I can use. I tried other things, but I could only do Strengthening."[lr]::
31916::$$$message_0255_0059_0001$$$::The rest are basic things like making a blueprint and stuff.[lr]::
31917::$$$message_0255_0059_0002$$$::That's not something to be talking about now.::
31918::$$$message_0255_0060_0000$$$::"I see. Mine is Conversion.[lr]::
31919::$$$message_0255_0060_0001$$$::The aggregation, flow, and transformation of power. That's my basic power, and I know all the famous spells. I can make a Bounded Field the size of a classroom and adjust the shape."::
31920::$$$message_0255_0061_0000$$$::Conversion of power... That's the most basic and all-rounder type.[lr]::
31921::$$$message_0255_0061_0001$$$::In other words, she's saying she can transfer magical energy into any vessel and transform it.::
31922::$$$message_0255_0062_0000$$$::"I see. I'm glad you're telling me, but is it really okay for you to tell me your magecraft?"[lr]::
31923::$$$message_0255_0062_0001$$$::"You told me yours, right? It's not fair if I hide mine."[lr]::
31924::$$$message_0255_0062_0002$$$::Tohsaka says and puts her left hand out.::
31925::$$$message_0255_0063_0000$$$::"I showed you last time, but this is my Magic Crest.[lr]::
31926::$$$message_0255_0063_0001$$$::The technique of Conversion is what's passed down in the Tohsaka family. I'm good at transferring power from myself or someone else.[lr]::
31927::$$$message_0255_0063_0002$$$::Usually, magical energy disappears when we take it out of our body, right?[lr]::
31928::$$$message_0255_0063_0003$$$::Magical energy itself can't create Mystics. We activate the equation called magecraft using magical energy before it disappears. So it's hard to transfer pure magical energy that's not involved in magecraft..."::
31929::$$$message_0255_0064_0000$$$::She stops there and takes out a small stone out of her pocket.[lr]::
31930::$$$message_0255_0064_0001$$$::...Is it a gem?[lr]::
31931::$$$message_0255_0064_0002$$$::The transparent polyhedron reminds me of a kaleidoscope.::
31932::$$$message_0255_0065_0000$$$::"But I can store my magical energy into other objects.[lr]::
31933::$$$message_0255_0065_0001$$$::No, not just my magical energy, but I can store other mages' magical energy. And although it's difficult, magical energy isn't the only thing I can transfer."::
31934::$$$message_0255_0066_0000$$$::"The most compatible storage space is a gem.[lr]::
31935::$$$message_0255_0066_0001$$$::You know that gems can act like a location that are easy to store thoughts, right? A prison that stops the flow of energy.[lr]::
31936::$$$message_0255_0066_0002$$$::On top of that, crystals that have been in the ground for a long time can house strong Nature Spirits. Such gems can become simple Magic Crests when magical energy is poured into them.[lr]::
31937::$$$message_0255_0066_0003$$$::Well, since they are gems, they'll break once the magical energy is released."::
31938::$$$message_0255_0067_0000$$$::Tohsaka shrugs and puts the gem away.[lr]::
31939::$$$message_0255_0067_0001$$$::"...Man, that's a waste. By breaking, you mean it'll go away after it's used once, right? Do you have to replace such an expensive thing like a gem each time?"::
31940::$$$message_0255_0068_0000$$$::"...Yeah, exactly. That's why we're always broke.[lr]::
31941::$$$message_0255_0068_0001$$$::Mages of the Tohsaka family have to start making money once they succeed..."[lr]::
31942::$$$message_0255_0068_0002$$$::"I see. Yeah, we all have our different problems, Tohsaka."::
31943::$$$message_0255_0069_0000$$$::"...Uhh..."[lr]::
31944::$$$message_0255_0069_0001$$$::She looks away, as if she said too much.[lr]::
31945::$$$message_0255_0069_0002$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
31946::$$$message_0255_0069_0003$$$::I think this every time, but Tohsaka is actually really awkward deep down.::
90004::$$$message_0255_9999_0000$$$::"Hey, Tohsaka..."::
90005::$$$message_0255_9999_0001$$$::"Can I ask you something?"::
90006::$$$message_0255_9999_0002$$$::"Oh, no, it's n-nothing. But...if there's something you want to say, I'm all ears."::
90007::$$$message_0255_9999_0003$$$::"Wh-what? Um, if you have something to say, you go ahead first."::G,
