3497::$$$message_0038_0000_0000$$$::"Okay. Try to Strengthen this lamp for starters.[lr]::
3498::$$$message_0038_0000_0001$$$::You just need to reinforce the glass."[lr]::
3499::$$$message_0038_0000_0002$$$::Tohsaka hands me an old-looking lamp.::
3500::$$$message_0038_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
3501::$$$message_0038_0001_0001$$$::I sit on the floor.[lr]::
3502::$$$message_0038_0001_0002$$$::I cup the lamp with my hands and take a deep breath.[lr]::
3503::$$$message_0038_0001_0003$$$::Tohsaka says it like it's so easy, but I'm all tense from nervousness.::
3504::$$$message_0038_0002_0000$$$::I've been trying this every night, but with a success rate below 0.1 percent.[lr]::
3505::$$$message_0038_0002_0001$$$::Tohsaka says she wants to see what I can do to measure my skill, but there's nothing to measure if my Strengthening doesn't work in the first place.::
3506::$$$message_0038_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
3507::$$$message_0038_0003_0001$$$::I try to shake off any distractions.[lr]::
3508::$$$message_0038_0003_0002$$$::Right now, I need to focus on the lamp.::
3509::$$$message_0038_0004_0000$$$::The blueprint of the lamp pops into my head.[lr]::
3510::$$$message_0038_0004_0001$$$::The material of the glass, its composition, the flow of its power...I can see it as if it were a network of blood vessels.[lr]::
3511::$$$message_0038_0004_0002$$$::Then all I have to do is to infuse my magical energy into those vessels.::
3512::$$$message_0038_0005_0000$$$::I just have to do what I always do.[lr]::
3513::$$$message_0038_0005_0001$$$::The sensation of a burning metal rod sliding down my spine.[lr]::
3514::$$$message_0038_0005_0002$$$::All I have to do is let that burning nerve into myself, however much it shouldn't exist in a human body, and let it fuse with me.[lr]::
3515::$$$message_0038_0005_0003$$$::As long as that works, all I have to do is to pour the right amount of magical energy into the glass.::
3516::$$$message_0038_0006_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
3517::$$$message_0038_0006_0001$$$::It shatters.[lr]::
3518::$$$message_0038_0006_0002$$$::I couldn't control myself, and I ended up using more magical energy than I should have...and the glass shattered.::
3519::$$$message_0038_0007_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
3520::$$$message_0038_0007_0001$$$::I look timidly at Tohsaka.[lr]::
3521::$$$message_0038_0007_0002$$$::"Figured. I was afraid this might be the case, and it is."::
3522::$$$message_0038_0008_0000$$$::"Hm? What do you mean, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
3523::$$$message_0038_0008_0001$$$::"Isn't it obvious? I was absolutely baffled by your lack of skill! First of all, you don't even understand the basics. Honestly, I'm impressed you can produce any magical energy at all with a method so completely absurd!"::
3524::$$$message_0038_0009_0000$$$::"Tohsaka...um...are you mad?"::
3525::$$$message_0038_0010_0000$$$::"Of course I'm mad! I can hardly believe you've been training when you have such basic problems, and I kind of want to kill your mentor for not correcting you![lr]::
3526::$$$message_0038_0010_0001$$$::Why are you doing it in such a roundabout way!?"::
3527::$$$message_0038_0011_0000$$$::"Hm. I get it, but don't bad-mouth my old man. It's my own fault that I don't have talent. He's got nothing to do with it."::
3528::$$$message_0038_0012_0000$$$::"He has everything to do with it. A teacher's job is to correct a student's errors, and he took you on as an apprentice.[lr]::
3529::$$$message_0038_0012_0001$$$::I know it's pointless to take it out on someone who's not here anymore, but your teacher got the [font italic=true]first step[font italic=false] wrong."::
3530::$$$message_0038_0013_0000$$$::Tohsaka, clearly still angry, takes something that looks like a can out of her bag.[lr]::
3531::$$$message_0038_0013_0001$$$::It looks like a can filled with colorful hard candy, the sort of thing children overseas might like.[lr]::
3532::$$$message_0038_0013_0002$$$::I've seen similar containers in Japan, too.[lr]::
3533::$$$message_0038_0013_0003$$$::They hold a variety of differently flavored candies. The white ones are mint.::
3534::$$$message_0038_0014_0000$$$::"Shirou, hold out your hand."[lr]::
3535::$$$message_0038_0014_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
3536::$$$message_0038_0014_0002$$$::I do as she asks.[lr]::
3537::$$$message_0038_0014_0003$$$::Tohsaka shakes out the can, and a red candy drops into my hand.::
3538::$$$message_0038_0015_0000$$$::"Here. Swallow this." [lr]::
3539::$$$message_0038_0015_0001$$$::"What???"[lr]::
3540::$$$message_0038_0015_0002$$$::Again, I do as she asks.::
3541::$$$message_0038_0016_0000$$$::"It's not sweet."[lr]::
3542::$$$message_0038_0016_0001$$$::Actually, it has no flavor at all.[lr]::
3543::$$$message_0038_0016_0002$$$::And the texture is...more like rock than candy.::
3544::$$$message_0038_0017_0000$$$::"...Hm?"[lr]::
3545::$$$message_0038_0017_0001$$$::I force myself to swallow it.[lr]::
3546::$$$message_0038_0017_0002$$$::"Whoa, ouch. My throat's tingling. What was that, Tohsaka?"::
3547::$$$message_0038_0018_0000$$$::"What do you mean? It's a jewel. Couldn't you tell?"[lr]::
3548::$$$message_0038_0018_0001$$$::She says it so casually.[lr]::
3549::$$$message_0038_0018_0002$$$::But it's totally outrageous.::
3550::$$$message_0038_0019_0000$$$::"Wha...a jewel!? Why!?"[lr]::
3551::$$$message_0038_0019_0001$$$::"I couldn't help it. I had some medicine too, but that won't work if I want to correct you. I figure I need to use the strongest possible options to open up your switch."::
3552::$$$message_0038_0020_0000$$$::"Uh, that's not my point...! Why did you make me swallow a jewel!? I can't digest that!"::
3553::$$$message_0038_0021_0000$$$::"You know, if you're going to worry, you should worry about other stuff. That wasn't an ordinary jewel.[lr]::
3554::$$$message_0038_0021_0001$$$::What I gave you just now is a compulsory learning device, since you don't know anything at all. It's going to start melting soon, so brace yourself or you'll faint."::
3555::$$$message_0038_0022_0000$$$::"You say that I'm going to faint so casually[line2]"[lr]::
3556::$$$message_0038_0022_0001$$$::Just as I say that...[lr]::
3557::$$$message_0038_0022_0002$$$::...it starts to get weird.::
3558::$$$message_0038_0023_0000$$$::"WHAT!?"[lr]::
3559::$$$message_0038_0023_0001$$$::My body is burning.[lr]::
3560::$$$message_0038_0023_0002$$$::My limbs are starting to go numb.[lr]::
3561::$$$message_0038_0023_0003$$$::Heat builds up in my back in a flare of what I can only describe as pain.[lr]::
3562::$$$message_0038_0023_0004$$$::I furrow my brow and try to concentrate, or I know I'll fall over.::
3563::$$$message_0038_0024_0000$$$::"You... What did..."[lr]::
3564::$$$message_0038_0024_0001$$$::I know.[lr]::
3565::$$$message_0038_0024_0002$$$::I know this feeling.[lr]::
3566::$$$message_0038_0024_0003$$$::This is the feeling of failure.[lr]::
3567::$$$message_0038_0024_0004$$$::This is my body reacting when it fails to construct a Magic Circuit inside me!::
3568::$$$message_0038_0025_0000$$$::"It's okay. It might be painful, but it should slowly ease up as long you can maintain this state. Though the heat could last for two or three weeks."[lr]::
3569::$$$message_0038_0025_0001$$$::...I really want to respond, but I can't stay composed enough to do it.[lr]::
3570::$$$message_0038_0025_0002$$$::All I can do is muster the strength to stay balanced so I don't topple over.::
3571::$$$message_0038_0026_0000$$$::"Listen. The difference between a mage and a human is the presence or absence of a switch.[lr]::
3572::$$$message_0038_0026_0001$$$::You already know that this switch is for turning the Magic Circuit on and off.[lr]::
3573::$$$message_0038_0026_0002$$$::See the electric kettle over there? Mages are like that. Ordinary humans are just regular kettles that can't boil water on their own, but they can at least keep it warm."::
3574::$$$message_0038_0027_0000$$$::"That's what we are: similar, but different.[lr]::
3575::$$$message_0038_0027_0001$$$::The difference is in whether someone has a switch to boil the water or not.[lr]::
3576::$$$message_0038_0027_0002$$$::The moment we are born with it...or rather, the moment it's made, is when we're separated into electric kettles and plain, insulated bottles. Anyone who doesn't have this switch won't ever be able to experience magecraft."::
3577::$$$message_0038_0028_0000$$$::"You see, you might be an amateur, but you [font italic=true]do[font italic=false] have a Magic Circuit.[lr]::
3578::$$$message_0038_0028_0001$$$::That means you have an affinity for it. It's why, once you've created a Magic Circuit inside you, all you have to do is use the switch.[lr]::
3579::$$$message_0038_0028_0002$$$::You're just toggling the switch on and off to produce magic energy."::
3580::$$$message_0038_0029_0000$$$::I calm my breathing.[lr]::
3581::$$$message_0038_0029_0001$$$::Just as Tohsaka said, so long as I maintain my composure, things don't get worse.::
3582::$$$message_0038_0030_0000$$$::"You only have to make a Magic Circuit once. But all this time, you've been creating a Magic Circuit from scratch and incorporating it into yourself every time you use it."::
3583::$$$message_0038_0031_0000$$$::"And that's such a waste. Once you've created the circuit inside yourself, even once, all you have to do is turn it on or off.[lr]::
3584::$$$message_0038_0031_0001$$$::Normally, those who have created a Magic Circuit would be trained in how to turn it on and off next.[lr]::
3585::$$$message_0038_0031_0002$$$::But your mentor didn't do that. So you've been risking your life creating a Magic Circuit every time.[lr]::
3586::$$$message_0038_0031_0003$$$::...Of course, your father may have been misinformed too."::
3587::$$$message_0038_0032_0000$$$::I exhale.[lr]::
3588::$$$message_0038_0032_0001$$$::Sensation is starting to return to my limbs.::
3589::$$$message_0038_0033_0000$$$::"Since you have been training the wrong way for so long, your switch is closed, which means all I can do is force it open and make your body understand it has a switch."::
3590::$$$message_0038_0034_0000$$$::"You see, that jewel you swallowed forces that switch on. So, you'll be like this forever unless you can use your own strength to turn it off and return to your normal state.[lr]::
3591::$$$message_0038_0034_0001$$$::If you can do that, you won't need the help of the jewel. After that, you should be able to control your Magic Circuit with some simple mental commands."::
3592::$$$message_0038_0035_0000$$$::"...I...get that, but..."[lr]::
3593::$$$message_0038_0035_0001$$$::Can't we do something about this [font italic=true]burning[font italic=false] sensation?[lr]::
3594::$$$message_0038_0035_0002$$$::She keeps telling me to turn off this switch, but how the hell I am supposed to do that?::
3595::$$$message_0038_0036_0000$$$::"Eh, you can already talk!?[lr]::
3596::$$$message_0038_0036_0001$$$::Huh. I guess you're good at controlling yourself. You might get back to normal faster than I thought.[lr]::
3597::$$$message_0038_0036_0002$$$::As for the switch itself, your body will naturally try to turn it off to calm down and get comfortable as quickly as it can.[lr]::
3598::$$$message_0038_0036_0003$$$::All you have to do is will that process to speed up. Easy, right?"::
3599::$$$message_0038_0037_0000$$$::"Uh...it's not... I don't get it.[lr]::
3600::$$$message_0038_0037_0001$$$::You say there's a switch, but it doesn't feel real to me."::
3601::$$$message_0038_0038_0000$$$::"You might think that right now, but eventually you'll be able to form a really clear image. It'll be like a button in your mind, and all you have to do is press it. It should open your Magic Circuit, easy as that."::
3602::$$$message_0038_0039_0000$$$::"I hope so...but I just feel sick right now..."::
3603::$$$message_0038_0040_0000$$$::"I figured you would. You've always closed your Magic Circuit after using your Strengthening magecraft, right?[lr]::
3604::$$$message_0038_0040_0001$$$::Now you're doing the opposite: opening your Magic Circuit up. It's like you're running full speed this whole time, so of course it's tough.[lr]::
3605::$$$message_0038_0040_0002$$$::But that's all part of being a mage. If you're going to fight as a Master, turning the switch on and off will be a huge help to you."::
3606::$$$message_0038_0041_0000$$$::"I know. You took me by surprise, but I appreciate what you did. You're right...once I grasp the idea of this switch, it'll help a lot."::
3607::$$$message_0038_0042_0000$$$::"So you do understand. No need to thank me, though. You're my ally, so I'm only doing this because I can't afford for you to be weak forever."[lr]::
3608::$$$message_0038_0042_0001$$$::Tohsaka huffs and looks away.[lr]::
3609::$$$message_0038_0042_0002$$$::Maybe it's because my body's all warm.[lr]::
3610::$$$message_0038_0042_0003$$$::But, dazed as I am, I find myself thinking that Tohsaka might just be a good person.::
3611::$$$message_0038_0043_0000$$$::"What? Why are you staring at me like that?"[lr]::
3612::$$$message_0038_0043_0001$$$::"Nothing. I just thought you weren't really being honest."::
3613::$$$message_0038_0044_0000$$$::"I see. You must have a lot of spare energy if you can manage to be so flippant right now. If you're fine, then you won't mind me continuing, right?"[lr]::
3614::$$$message_0038_0044_0001$$$::Tohsaka grins wickedly and draws closer.::
3615::$$$message_0038_0045_0000$$$::"...Ugh."[lr]::
3616::$$$message_0038_0045_0001$$$::Hold on a minute.[lr]::
3617::$$$message_0038_0045_0002$$$::I still can't move a muscle, so what is she...hey.::
3618::$$$message_0038_0046_0000$$$::"Try doing your Strengthening magecraft again.[lr]::
3619::$$$message_0038_0046_0001$$$::You might not be able to control your magical energy right now, but you'll be no use in battle unless you can get used to being in this state.[lr]::
3620::$$$message_0038_0046_0002$$$::It's okay. I brought a ton of lamps. I don't know how many times you're going to fail, but I'm not going to let you rest until you succeed in Strengthening."::
3621::$$$message_0038_0047_0000$$$::She smiles, and even though I can hardly move, she hands me a lamp.[lr]::
3622::$$$message_0038_0047_0001$$$::"...Ungh."[lr]::
3623::$$$message_0038_0047_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Tohsaka, this is brutal. It's like forcing someone to walk a tightrope while they have a forty-degree fever...[font italic=false]::
3624::$$$message_0038_0048_0000$$$::"Honestly, I didn't think I'd give up before you did."[lr]::
3625::$$$message_0038_0048_0001$$$::Tohsaka glares at me.[lr]::
3626::$$$message_0038_0048_0002$$$::Her penetrating stare is accusing.::
3627::$$$message_0038_0049_0000$$$::"...Uh...sorry?"[lr]::
3628::$$$message_0038_0049_0001$$$::"I underestimated you. I never imagined you would destroy all thirty.[lr]::
3629::$$$message_0038_0049_0002$$$::Sorry, but that's it for today's training. We don't have anything else left to measure your skill at Strengthening."::
3630::$$$message_0038_0050_0000$$$::"...Ugh."[lr]::
3631::$$$message_0038_0050_0001$$$::Come on, at least I tried.[lr]::
3632::$$$message_0038_0050_0002$$$::I tried hard, even though my body was burning up like I'd been thrown into a boiling kettle.[lr]::
3633::$$$message_0038_0050_0003$$$::I tried, but in the end, I didn't manage to succeed in my magecraft a single time.::
3634::$$$message_0038_0051_0000$$$::"You know, if it's just the glass that's broken, you can fix it. I saw you fix the broken window in my house the other day."[lr]::
3635::$$$message_0038_0051_0001$$$::"I can't. That window got broken normally, but these lamps broke because it couldn't hold all your magical energy. It's much harder to work with things infused with someone else's magical energy... Remember that, okay?"::
3636::$$$message_0038_0052_0000$$$::"Hm. Yeah?"[lr]::
3637::$$$message_0038_0052_0001$$$::"That's right. Go ahead and rest, Shirou. I'd call this a win since I managed to trigger your switch.[lr]::
3638::$$$message_0038_0052_0002$$$::Once you're able to control it, I'll teach you the rest."::
3639::$$$message_0038_0053_0000$$$::"Phew. I appreciate the chance to rest, but what else are you going to teach me?"::
3640::$$$message_0038_0054_0000$$$::"You can only do Strengthening magecraft, right? You said that's all you can do, so I might be able to kick it up another notch and teach you Alteration magecraft.[lr]::
3641::$$$message_0038_0054_0001$$$::Have you been taught what Strengthening, Alteration, and Projection magecraft are?"::
3642::$$$message_0038_0055_0000$$$::"...Hm."[lr]::
3643::$$$message_0038_0055_0001$$$::I have, a little.[lr]::
3644::$$$message_0038_0055_0002$$$::Strengthening is, as the word suggests, used to strengthen something.[lr]::
3645::$$$message_0038_0055_0003$$$::Most people typically think of Strengthening as just making something harder, but it actually involves enhancing an object's attributes and effects.[lr]::
3646::$$$message_0038_0055_0004$$$::A sword gets sharper, a lamp glows brighter, and so on.::
3647::$$$message_0038_0056_0000$$$::Alteration doesn't need much explanation.[lr]::
3648::$$$message_0038_0056_0001$$$::For example, you can't start a fire using blades.[lr]::
3649::$$$message_0038_0056_0002$$$::Alteration is when some ability beyond the object's usual traits is imbued into it.[lr]::
3650::$$$message_0038_0056_0003$$$::And then Projection is...::
3651::$$$message_0038_0057_0000$$$::"Wait. What is Projection again? I remember my old man saying that word a lot, but..."::
3652::$$$message_0038_0058_0000$$$::"You know what Strengthening and Alteration are, right? Then I think you can imagine what Projection is.[lr]::
3653::$$$message_0038_0058_0001$$$::Simply put, it's magecraft that can replicate things.[lr]::
3654::$$$message_0038_0058_0002$$$::Unlike Strengthening and Alteration, Projection isn't a magecraft that imbues an object with something.[lr]::
3655::$$$message_0038_0058_0003$$$::It's essentially magecraft that constructs something from nothing, using only your own magical energy. It's one of the most difficult disciplines."::
3656::$$$message_0038_0059_0000$$$::"Oh...but you know that magical energy is disposable, right?[lr]::
3657::$$$message_0038_0059_0001$$$::Anything you create with Projection will quickly disappear.[lr]::
3658::$$$message_0038_0059_0002$$$::If you Project a sword with ten times the magical energy you use to Strengthen an existing sword...the Strengthened sword will still be stronger.[lr]::
3659::$$$message_0038_0059_0003$$$::Strengthening augments something, so it's efficient.[lr]::
3660::$$$message_0038_0059_0004$$$::On the other hand, Projection uses way too much magical energy, so it's not really used all that often."::
3661::$$$message_0038_0060_0000$$$::"Oh I remember now. My old man said something similar. He said it wasn't worth it, so I shouldn't pursue it."::
3662::$$$message_0038_0061_0000$$$::"Exactly. Now if you're done asking questions, let's call it a day. You seem shaky on your feet, so I can help you get back to your room."::
3663::$$$message_0038_0062_0000$$$::Tohsaka helps me to my room.[lr]::
3664::$$$message_0038_0062_0001$$$::And Saber is waiting for me by the veranda corridor.::
3665::$$$message_0038_0063_0000$$$::"Good work, both of you."[lr]::
3666::$$$message_0038_0063_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
3667::$$$message_0038_0063_0002$$$::I don't even have the strength to answer.[lr]::
3668::$$$message_0038_0063_0003$$$::I just nod in thanks and head into my room.::
3669::$$$message_0038_0064_0000$$$::"How is Shirou doing, Rin?"[lr]::
3670::$$$message_0038_0064_0001$$$::"Bad. Really bad. He doesn't have the talent."[lr]::
3671::$$$message_0038_0064_0002$$$::It's a typically merciless Tohsaka response.::
3672::$$$message_0038_0065_0000$$$::...And the next thing I know, I'm staring up at the night sky.[lr]::
3673::$$$message_0038_0065_0001$$$::Tonight, I'm not trying to run away because I'm anxious around Saber.[lr]::
3674::$$$message_0038_0065_0002$$$::I'm just trying to let the night wind cool my burning body...and to think about what Tohsaka taught me.::
3675::$$$message_0038_0066_0000$$$::"Once I can use my switch, then it'll be time to think about the next steps.[lr]::
3676::$$$message_0038_0066_0001$$$::If I can't even manage the simple task of Strengthening, I don't know what the future might hold for me."::
3677::$$$message_0038_0067_0000$$$::I try to infuse magical energy into a wooden plank I dragged out from the shed as I mumble to myself.[lr]::
3678::$$$message_0038_0067_0001$$$::A cracking sound echoes up to me.[lr]::
3679::$$$message_0038_0067_0002$$$::The plank cracks, and my Strengthening fails.::
3680::$$$message_0038_0068_0000$$$::"I can see its structure fine, but I don't understand why I can't control my magical energy."[lr]::
3681::$$$message_0038_0068_0001$$$::Tohsaka said I was putting too much power into it.[lr]::
3682::$$$message_0038_0068_0002$$$::She even said that I should just use small amounts of magical energy, and just focus on reinforcing the object's weak points.[lr]::
3683::$$$message_0038_0068_0003$$$::So she's basically telling me to take it easy.::
3684::$$$message_0038_0069_0000$$$::"She doesn't have to remind me."[lr]::
3685::$$$message_0038_0069_0001$$$::Problem is, I can't manage to ease up.[lr]::
3686::$$$message_0038_0069_0002$$$::If only there was a good way to relax...[lr]::
3687::$$$message_0038_0069_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
3688::$$$message_0038_0069_0004$$$::The sound of barely audible footsteps just reaches my ears.[lr]::
3689::$$$message_0038_0069_0005$$$::This is the second time I've sensed that presence.::
3690::$$$message_0038_0070_0000$$$::"What? I don't need anything from you."[lr]::
3691::$$$message_0038_0070_0001$$$::"The feeling's mutual. Rin, however, is apparently concerned about you. I can't just sit by and do nothing about that."::
3692::$$$message_0038_0071_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
3693::$$$message_0038_0071_0001$$$::I throw the plank away, glaring at Archer.[lr]::
3694::$$$message_0038_0071_0002$$$::Archer seems curious about the plank. He picks it up.::
3695::$$$message_0038_0072_0000$$$::"Strengthening magecraft, huh? Pretty pathetic quality too, I might add."[lr]::
3696::$$$message_0038_0072_0001$$$::"What!? Yeah, I know I'm not a fully trained mage. I feel bad for making your Master take on extra work for me."[lr]::
3697::$$$message_0038_0072_0002$$$::"No, that's not it. Even Rin is mistaken on this matter."[lr]::
3698::$$$message_0038_0072_0003$$$::"Eh? What do you mea[line2]"::
3699::$$$message_0038_0073_0000$$$::"Hmph. Applying new traits to something that already exists? That's just wishful thinking. You aren't skillful enough to do something like that."[lr]::
3700::$$$message_0038_0073_0001$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"::
3701::$$$message_0038_0074_0000$$$::He's just saying whatever he wants, but I can't think of a response. He's right.[lr]::
3702::$$$message_0038_0074_0001$$$::I know I'm not skilled, and it's my own fault I can't do magecraft properly.[lr]::
3703::$$$message_0038_0074_0002$$$::There's no point in taking it out on him.::
3704::$$$message_0038_0075_0000$$$::"What's wrong? You were more spirited last night."[lr]::
3705::$$$message_0038_0075_0001$$$::"Shut up! I'm just not saying anything because you're right.[lr]::
3706::$$$message_0038_0075_0002$$$::It's all my fault for not being good enough."::
3707::$$$message_0038_0076_0000$$$::I huff and look away.[lr]::
3708::$$$message_0038_0076_0001$$$::I don't know how he interpreted that, but...[lr]::
3709::$$$message_0038_0076_0002$$$::"Hm. In a way, I think you've been cursed with poor mentors..."[lr]::
3710::$$$message_0038_0076_0003$$$::Archer almost sounds impressed for a moment.::
3711::$$$message_0038_0077_0000$$$::"Eh? That's not true. My old man and Tohsaka are good teachers. I'm the one who can't learn."::
3712::$$$message_0038_0078_0000$$$::"That's exactly it. You're better off with a mage who has no talent.[lr]::
3713::$$$message_0038_0078_0001$$$::Geniuses will never understand the struggles of ordinary people.[lr]::
3714::$$$message_0038_0078_0002$$$::Rin is far too brilliant to understand the mistakes a failure like you is making."::
3715::$$$message_0038_0079_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
3716::$$$message_0038_0079_0001$$$::I don't really get what Archer's trying to say.[lr]::
3717::$$$message_0038_0079_0002$$$::I don't get it, but if I had to guess...::
3718::$$$message_0038_0080_0000$$$::"I don't get it. Are you just trying to pick a fight?"[lr]::
3719::$$$message_0038_0080_0001$$$::If so...bring it on.[lr]::
3720::$$$message_0038_0080_0002$$$::"Another mistake. You're not fit for fighting, Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
3721::$$$message_0038_0080_0003$$$::Your battle is supposed to be a mental one...a fight against your own self."::
3722::$$$message_0038_0081_0000$$$::"They say a mage's battle is a mental one. I already know that. But if we're gonna fight, it should be with our fists."::
3723::$$$message_0038_0082_0000$$$::"Honestly...you're making things pretty hard on Saber."[lr]::
3724::$$$message_0038_0082_0001$$$::Archer despises me from the bottom of his heart.[lr]::
3725::$$$message_0038_0082_0002$$$::I've never seen his eyes like this... They seem filled with real disappointment and anger.::
3726::$$$message_0038_0083_0000$$$::"I'm only going to say this once, so listen carefully: [lr]::
3727::$$$message_0038_0083_0001$$$::You haven't got a prayer of winning once the battle starts.[lr]::
3728::$$$message_0038_0083_0002$$$::None of your skills are worth a damn against Servants."::
3729::$$$message_0038_0084_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
3730::$$$message_0038_0084_0001$$$::Saber already told me that.[lr]::
3731::$$$message_0038_0084_0002$$$::I won't win in battle.[lr]::
3732::$$$message_0038_0084_0003$$$::No matter what grand scheme I try, I have no chance of victory.::
3733::$$$message_0038_0085_0000$$$::"Then at least imagine it. If you can't possibly beat the opponent in reality, then beat them in your imagination.[lr]::
3734::$$$message_0038_0085_0001$$$::If you can't win yourself...imagine something that [font italic=true]can[font italic=false] win.[lr]::
3735::$$$message_0038_0085_0002$$$::It's all you can really do."::
3736::$$$message_0038_0086_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
3737::$$$message_0038_0086_0001$$$::I don't know why...[lr]::
3738::$$$message_0038_0086_0002$$$::But Archer's words strike a chord with me.::
3739::$$$message_0038_0087_0000$$$::My heart's telling me not to forget them.[lr]::
3740::$$$message_0038_0087_0001$$$::More than anyone else, I know I should never forget what this man's saying.::
3741::$$$message_0038_0088_0000$$$::"What a joke. I can't believe I'm giving advice to someone I should be killing. I guess a bit of Rin's softness has rubbed off on me."[lr]::
3742::$$$message_0038_0088_0001$$$::All of a sudden, Archer disappears.[lr]::
3743::$$$message_0038_0088_0002$$$::Archer's supposed to be keeping watch.[lr]::
3744::$$$message_0038_0088_0003$$$::He must have gone back to the roof, where he can do that best.::
3745::$$$message_0038_0089_0000$$$::"What's with him?"[lr]::
3746::$$$message_0038_0089_0001$$$::I complain to the empty air.[lr]::
3747::$$$message_0038_0089_0002$$$::Naturally, there's no response.[lr]::
3748::$$$message_0038_0089_0003$$$::While Archer's words echo in my mind, the cold air blows over my flushed body.::
