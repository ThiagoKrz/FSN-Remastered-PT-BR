45394::$$$message_0401_0000_0000$$$::"Hup...!"[lr]::
45395::$$$message_0401_0000_0001$$$::I match the repeated attacks from the long sword with a long sword.[lr]::
45396::$$$message_0401_0000_0002$$$::The swords offset each other, and the fragments are sent flying into the atmosphere. ::
45397::$$$message_0401_0001_0000$$$::"Hey, don't..."[lr]::
45398::$$$message_0401_0001_0001$$$::The handle of a curved sword appears behind him.[lr]::
45399::$$$message_0401_0001_0002$$$::"...Get ahead of yourself, kid...!"[lr]::
45400::$$$message_0401_0001_0003$$$::But I'm faster...[lr]::
45401::$$$message_0401_0001_0004$$$::I pull out the curved sword at his feet and swing it straight at him...!::
45402::$$$message_0401_0002_0000$$$::"Ungh!"[lr]::
45403::$$$message_0401_0002_0001$$$::Gilgamesh retreats.[lr]::
45404::$$$message_0401_0002_0002$$$::I close the distance at once, pull out the sword, and slash at him.::
45405::$$$message_0401_0003_0000$$$::"Guh, why...!?[lr]::
45406::$$$message_0401_0003_0001$$$::Why am I losing to this mongrel's sword...!?"[lr]::
45407::$$$message_0401_0003_0002$$$::I match my sword to the rapid successions of Noble Phantasms.::
45408::$$$message_0401_0004_0000$$$::"Haah... Haah, haah, haah, haah...!"[lr]::
45409::$$$message_0401_0004_0001$$$::I'm not thinking.[lr]::
45410::$$$message_0401_0004_0002$$$::My body and mind will stop if I stop.[lr]::
45411::$$$message_0401_0004_0003$$$::I will keep moving forward now.[lr]::
45412::$$$message_0401_0004_0004$$$::The instant I see his Noble Phantasm, I reel in the same one that I have at hand, and strike him down with all my might...!::
45413::$$$message_0401_0005_0000$$$::"Impossible... Am I being cornered by such a sham...!?"::
45414::$$$message_0401_0006_0000$$$::"Ungh, hnng...!"[lr]::
45415::$$$message_0401_0006_0001$$$::The sounds of clashing swords echo through the area.[lr]::
45416::$$$message_0401_0006_0002$$$::He cannot handle my attacks and has to destroy my weapon with his.::
45417::$$$message_0401_0007_0000$$$::   That will be the cause of his defeat.[lr]::
45418::$$$message_0401_0007_0001$$$::Having over 1000 Noble Phantasms, he is the greatest Heroic Spirit without a doubt.::
45419::$$$message_0401_0008_0000$$$::But, he is no more than an owner.[lr]::
45420::$$$message_0401_0008_0001$$$::He is not a wielder who only has one Noble Phantasm but is able to use that to its fullest potential.::
45421::$$$message_0401_0009_0000$$$::If my opponent was another Servant, I would not be able to match them even if I made a world like this.[lr]::
45422::$$$message_0401_0009_0001$$$::Even if I have infinite swords, I can't beat an enemy who has a single ultimate Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
45423::$$$message_0401_0009_0002$$$::I'm sure Gilgamesh would be able to, but I don't have enough physical ability to.::
45424::$$$message_0401_0010_0000$$$::Therefore... The only Servant that I can close in on is this man.[lr]::
45425::$$$message_0401_0010_0001$$$::If we have the same ability and are both owners, I'll go a step ahead of him since I already have swords prepared...!::
45426::$$$message_0401_0011_0000$$$::"Dammit... Dammit, dammit dammit dammit dammit dammit...!!! I did not think I would have to use my sword against someone like you...!"[lr]::
45427::$$$message_0401_0011_0001$$$::Gilgamesh raises his arm.[lr]::
45428::$$$message_0401_0011_0002$$$::The hilt that appears behind him is that demonic sword, the only sword that does not exist in this world...!::
45429::$$$message_0401_0012_0000$$$::"I won't let you...!"[lr]::
45430::$$$message_0401_0012_0001$$$::"Guh...!?"[lr]::
45431::$$$message_0401_0012_0002$$$::I swing my twin swords.[lr]::
45432::$$$message_0401_0012_0003$$$::I immediately draw Kanshou and Bakuya and cut off his arm as it reaches for his magical sword...!::
45433::$$$message_0401_0013_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
45434::$$$message_0401_0013_0001$$$::The weapons come to a halt.[lr]::
45435::$$$message_0401_0013_0002$$$::He loses his best sword and is left completely defenseless.::
45436::$$$message_0401_0014_0000$$$::"Hup...!"[lr]::
45437::$$$message_0401_0014_0001$$$::My body acts before I can think.[lr]::
45438::$$$message_0401_0014_0002$$$::With victory assured, my arms and legs drive me into the King of Heroes' space even more sharply to slice his body in two...!::
45439::$$$message_0401_0015_0000$$$::"...Guh!"[lr]::
45440::$$$message_0401_0015_0001$$$::He jumps back.[lr]::
45441::$$$message_0401_0015_0002$$$::Gilgamesh retreats, barely dodging my twin swords.::
45442::$$$message_0401_0016_0000$$$::"Khh... At this moment, you are stronger than me...!"[lr]::
45443::$$$message_0401_0016_0001$$$::Gilgamesh admits his defeat and tries to retreat.::
45444::$$$message_0401_0017_0000$$$::"I'm not letting you get away."[lr]::
45445::$$$message_0401_0017_0001$$$::I'll lose if he regains his composure. I have to settle the match at this moment before this heat cools down...![lr]::
45446::$$$message_0401_0017_0002$$$::"Bastard...!"::
45447::$$$message_0401_0018_0000$$$::"Crap...!"[lr]::
45448::$$$message_0401_0018_0001$$$::He must've realized that he would not be able to escape, as he pulls out a Noble Phantasm from behind him with his remaining arm.[lr]::
45449::$$$message_0401_0018_0002$$$::But I'm faster.[lr]::
45450::$$$message_0401_0018_0003$$$::Meanwhile, I'll surely...::
45451::$$$message_0401_0019_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
45452::$$$message_0401_0019_0001$$$::"What...?"[lr]::
45453::$$$message_0401_0019_0002$$$::Our voices overlap.[lr]::
45454::$$$message_0401_0019_0003$$$::That change is instant.::
45455::$$$message_0401_0020_0000$$$::The flash of light coming from the lake eliminates the hill of swords.[lr]::
45456::$$$message_0401_0020_0001$$$::The massive magical energy wiped away the already disappearing Reality Marble.::
45457::$$$message_0401_0021_0000$$$::    That's fine.[lr]::
45458::$$$message_0401_0021_0001$$$::The match is settled.[lr]::
45459::$$$message_0401_0021_0002$$$::I can defeat this Servant just by swinging these twin swords.[lr]::
45460::$$$message_0401_0021_0003$$$::But after that...::
45461::$$$message_0401_0022_0000$$$::A black hole.[lr]::
45462::$$$message_0401_0022_0001$$$::A round void big enough to swallow a human whole...[lr]::
45463::$$$message_0401_0022_0002$$$::appears before me... On Gilgamesh's body.::
45464::$$$message_0401_0023_0000$$$::"Wh...at?"[lr]::
45465::$$$message_0401_0023_0001$$$::Gilgamesh looks down at his own body, appalled.[lr]::
45466::$$$message_0401_0023_0002$$$::...His body is being swallowed.[lr]::
45467::$$$message_0401_0023_0003$$$::The golden Servant is being swallowed up by the hole that has opened inside him.::
45468::$$$message_0401_0024_0000$$$::"Wa[line2]"[lr]::
45469::$$$message_0401_0024_0001$$$::Did he want to say "wait?"[lr]::
45470::$$$message_0401_0024_0002$$$::The void mercilessly swallows the Servant.[lr]::
45471::$$$message_0401_0024_0003$$$::...There was no way for him to escape.[lr]::
45472::$$$message_0401_0024_0004$$$::The void was opened in his own body after all.[lr]::
45473::$$$message_0401_0024_0005$$$::There's no way he can escape from something that is in his body.::
45474::$$$message_0401_0025_0000$$$::"...What was... that?"[lr]::
45475::$$$message_0401_0025_0001$$$::I stand there, dumbfounded.[lr]::
45476::$$$message_0401_0025_0002$$$::The void in front of me gets smaller by the moment.::
45477::$$$message_0401_0026_0000$$$::...I don't know what this is.[lr]::
45478::$$$message_0401_0026_0001$$$::But it seems like Tohsaka and Saber were able to destroy the Holy Grail.[lr]::
45479::$$$message_0401_0026_0002$$$::My only guess is that this black void appeared from that effect and he vanished.::
45480::$$$message_0401_0027_0000$$$::"...Phew. Anyways, now..."[lr]::
45481::$$$message_0401_0027_0001$$$::Everything is over.[lr]::
45482::$$$message_0401_0027_0002$$$::The twin swords disappear.[lr]::
45483::$$$message_0401_0027_0003$$$::The magical energy occupying my body rapidly fades, and at the same time...[lr]::
45484::$$$message_0401_0027_0004$$$::"Oh... Shoot."[lr]::
45485::$$$message_0401_0027_0005$$$::Fatigue assails me.::
45486::$$$message_0401_0027_0006$$$::"...Damn. This is bad, I can't walk."[lr]::
45487::$$$message_0401_0027_0007$$$::I want to go see how Tohsaka's doing right away, but my body won't move.[lr]::
45488::$$$message_0401_0027_0008$$$::...Well, I'm sure she's doing fine since Saber went to her.::
45489::$$$message_0401_0027_0009$$$::"...Right. I guess..."[lr]::
45490::$$$message_0401_0027_0010$$$::I can rest a bit.[lr]::
45491::$$$message_0401_0027_0011$$$::And the moment I take a deep breath...[lr]::
45492::$$$message_0401_0027_0012$$$::"Wha[line2]!?"[lr]::
45493::$$$message_0401_0027_0013$$$::A chain wraps around my arm.::
45494::$$$message_0401_0028_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
45495::$$$message_0401_0028_0001$$$::My breath stops.[lr]::
45496::$$$message_0401_0028_0002$$$::The chain that's mercilessly wrapped around my arm pulls me towards the black hole...!::
45497::$$$message_0401_0029_0000$$$::"Agh, khh...!"[lr]::
45498::$$$message_0401_0029_0001$$$::I put strength in my limbs, but I can't resist at all.[lr]::
45499::$$$message_0401_0029_0002$$$::My feet slide towards the void along with the very ground they are planted on...!::
45500::$$$message_0401_0030_0000$$$::"Khh... That fool, does he not even know that Servants cannot become the core...!?"[lr]::
45501::$$$message_0401_0030_0001$$$::"You...!"::
45502::$$$message_0401_0031_0000$$$::The thing crawling from the void was definitely him.[lr]::
45503::$$$message_0401_0031_0001$$$::But... That body has melted here and there.[lr]::
45504::$$$message_0401_0031_0002$$$::That void must melt anything it swallows...!::
45505::$$$message_0401_0032_0000$$$::"Khh, you little...!"[lr]::
45506::$$$message_0401_0032_0001$$$::I try to pull the chain off of me, but it doesn't budge.[lr]::
45507::$$$message_0401_0032_0002$$$::This chain restrained even Berserker. It's not something that I can take off no matter how hard I try...!::
45508::$$$message_0401_0033_0000$$$::"Agh, guh..."[lr]::
45509::$$$message_0401_0033_0001$$$::I'm getting drawn in...![lr]::
45510::$$$message_0401_0033_0002$$$::I'll be swallowed like him if I go near that void...!::
45511::$$$message_0401_0034_0000$$$::"Damn, are you trying to take me with you...!?"[lr]::
45512::$$$message_0401_0034_0001$$$::"You fool, I have no intention of dying...![lr]::
45513::$$$message_0401_0034_0002$$$::Stay right there until I pull myself out, you lowlife!"[lr]::
45514::$$$message_0401_0034_0003$$$::"You...!"[lr]::
45515::$$$message_0401_0034_0004$$$::He's so arrogant even in a situation like this...!::
45516::$$$message_0401_0035_0000$$$::"Ah... Khh, damn..."[lr]::
45517::$$$message_0401_0035_0001$$$::But, what should I do?[lr]::
45518::$$$message_0401_0035_0002$$$::I can't get the chain off no matter what I do.[lr]::
45519::$$$message_0401_0035_0003$$$::I'll fall into the void along with him like this.[lr]::
45520::$$$message_0401_0035_0004$$$::Even if I hold out, he'll pull himself out then.::
45521::$$$message_0401_0036_0000$$$::It means I'm going to die either way...[lr]::
