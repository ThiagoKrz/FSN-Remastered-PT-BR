50717::$$$message_0438_0000_0000$$$::Since it's noon already and we missed breakfast, we decide to have lunch for now.[lr]::
50718::$$$message_0438_0000_0001$$$::Saber can't turn into spirit form like Archer, since unlike the other Masters, I'm not providing her the magical energy that she needs.[lr]::
50719::$$$message_0438_0000_0002$$$::It goes without saying that I'm an inexperienced Master.::
50720::$$$message_0438_0001_0000$$$::She says she can prevent the consumption of magical energy by getting sleep, but she can't replenish it no matter how much she limits herself.[lr]::
50721::$$$message_0438_0001_0001$$$::In that case, the only way to replenish her energy is by eating food. Since I'm in charge of the meals, I can't cut corners.::
50722::$$$message_0438_0002_0000$$$::"Servants are materialized using magical energy, right?[lr]::
50723::$$$message_0438_0002_0001$$$::So then... If your magical energy isn't restored, are you going to get weaker as you fight...?"[lr]::
50724::$$$message_0438_0002_0002$$$::After putting away the dishes, I ask while I fold my apron.::
50725::$$$message_0438_0003_0000$$$::"It does not mean that energy is never restored.[lr]::
50726::$$$message_0438_0003_0001$$$::Magical energy is produced within my body as long as I'm active. Even if Servants do not get support from without, they can replenish their magical energy using their own Magic Circuits."[lr]::
50727::$$$message_0438_0003_0002$$$::"Oh. Then isn't there no problem?"::
50728::$$$message_0438_0004_0000$$$::"...Well, how do I explain this? Let's see... Let's use this faucet as an example.[lr]::
50729::$$$message_0438_0004_0001$$$::There is water dripping from the faucet now, correct? Think of this as the amount of magical energy produced within my body. Consider the cup receiving the dripping water as myself.[lr]::
50730::$$$message_0438_0004_0002$$$::In this state, little by little, I can accumulate magical energy."::
50731::$$$message_0438_0005_0000$$$::"Now. The more water the cup holds, the more water can come out of the faucet.[lr]::
50732::$$$message_0438_0005_0001$$$::As long as the cup holds water, water will continue flowing from the faucet. But once the cup's water runs out[line2]when I use up my magical energy[line2]the faucet will completely shut off."::
50733::$$$message_0438_0006_0000$$$::"At which point there will be no supply of magical energy, and the cup will forever stay empty.[lr]::
50734::$$$message_0438_0006_0001$$$::   That means termination for the Servant.[lr]::
50735::$$$message_0438_0006_0002$$$::Either they receive a fatal wound, or they run out of magical energy...though the latter rarely occurs."::
50736::$$$message_0438_0007_0000$$$::"...But it's fine as long as there's at least a drop left in the cup, right? If the cup has some magical energy[line2]water[line2]then the faucet is still on. So if time passes, the cup will fill with water."::
50737::$$$message_0438_0008_0000$$$::"That is correct. However, the water filling the cup is constantly consumed, even as we speak.[lr]::
50738::$$$message_0438_0008_0001$$$::Additionally, it is lost at an ever-increasing pace during battle.[lr]::
50739::$$$message_0438_0008_0002$$$::...In fact, the more powerful the action, the more water it consumes. If I were to use a Noble Phantasm, I could empty the entire cup even if it were full."::
50740::$$$message_0438_0009_0000$$$::...This is getting complicated.[lr]::
50741::$$$message_0438_0009_0001$$$::To sum it up, since I am figuratively Saber's faucet, she can only restore magical energy at a slow pace since I am only providing the equivalent of a drip.[lr]::
50742::$$$message_0438_0009_0002$$$::So to fill the cup with water, she has to vanquish her enemies swiftly, followed by resting and conserving energy as efficiently as possible.::
50743::$$$message_0438_0010_0000$$$::"...Oh man. So using your Noble Phantasm is a luxury we can't afford, huh?"[lr]::
50744::$$$message_0438_0010_0001$$$::"That is correct. However, it does not mean that I cannot use it.[lr]::
50745::$$$message_0438_0010_0002$$$::If I suppress its power, it should be possible to use it once."::
50746::$$$message_0438_0011_0000$$$::"What are you saying? I can't let you do that. You're not allowed to use your Noble Phantasm, okay? If you die doing that, there's no way I could ever make it up to you."[lr]::
50747::$$$message_0438_0011_0001$$$::Saber sets her tea down.::
50748::$$$message_0438_0012_0000$$$::"...Hmm."[lr]::
50749::$$$message_0438_0012_0001$$$::She frowns and reaches for the tea.::
50750::$$$message_0438_0013_0000$$$::    Then...[lr]::
50751::$$$message_0438_0013_0001$$$::We're thankfully interrupted by the phone ringing.::
50752::$$$message_0438_0014_0000$$$::"...A phone call at this time on a Sunday..."[lr]::
50753::$$$message_0438_0014_0001$$$::I have a good idea of who it is, and I'm terrified of what'll happen if I were to ignore the call.::
50754::$$$message_0438_0015_0000$$$::"...Hello? This is Emiya."[lr]::
50755::$$$message_0438_0015_0001$$$::"Hi, this is Fujimura!"::
50756::$$$message_0438_0016_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
50757::$$$message_0438_0016_0001$$$::I feel dizzy.[lr]::
50758::$$$message_0438_0016_0002$$$::She's so overpowering.[lr]::
50759::$$$message_0438_0016_0003$$$::The sound of her voice is enough to pull me back to the everyday reality from before all this nonsense that has happened overnight.::
50760::$$$message_0438_0017_0000$$$::"...What do you want? Just so you know, I'm busy, Fuji-nee."[lr]::
50761::$$$message_0438_0017_0001$$$::"What, I'm busy, too. I gave up my day off to teach my students."[lr]::
50762::$$$message_0438_0017_0002$$$::It's strange.[lr]::
50763::$$$message_0438_0017_0003$$$::It's like she's right in front of me, puffing with pride.::
50764::$$$message_0438_0018_0000$$$::"Okay. Well, nobody here is being robbed or dying, so you can get back to chaperoning club activities with a clear conscience and all that."[lr]::
50765::$$$message_0438_0018_0001$$$::I try to cut the conversation short.::
50766::$$$message_0438_0019_0000$$$::"H-hey, wait! Your big sister is swallowing her pride and calling you, so it would be terrible if you hung up without listening to what I have to say!"[lr]::
50767::$$$message_0438_0019_0001$$$::...Yeah, and I've been neck-deep in it for the past night. Not that saying so would help any.[lr]::
50768::$$$message_0438_0019_0002$$$::Though I suppose if she's desperate enough to make a call, she really is in trouble?::
50769::$$$message_0438_0020_0000$$$::"...Okay. So, what's up?"[lr]::
50770::$$$message_0438_0020_0001$$$::"Shirou, I wanna eat lunch. How about those sweet rolled omelettes you make?"[lr]::
50771::$$$message_0438_0020_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
50772::$$$message_0438_0020_0003$$$::"That'll be it for my order. I want it delivered to the kyudo club right away. Bye."[lr]::
50773::$$$message_0438_0020_0004$$$::...Honestly. What's up with that teacher?::
50774::$$$message_0438_0021_0000$$$::"...Man, they say that beasts go wild when they're hungry..."[lr]::
50775::$$$message_0438_0021_0001$$$::I put my apron back on.[lr]::
50776::$$$message_0438_0021_0002$$$::...Well, there's leftovers from lunch anyway, and rolled omelettes are easy enough to add.::
50777::$$$message_0438_0022_0000$$$::"Okay, I'm done... Saber, can you watch the house for a bit?[lr]::
50778::$$$message_0438_0022_0001$$$::I'll be right back, so wait here, okay?"[lr]::
50779::$$$message_0438_0022_0002$$$::I head out to the hallway, carrying Fuji-nee's lunch.[lr]::
50780::$$$message_0438_0022_0003$$$::Saber follows.::
50781::$$$message_0438_0023_0000$$$::I put on my shoes.[lr]::
50782::$$$message_0438_0023_0001$$$::When I look up...[lr]::
50783::$$$message_0438_0023_0002$$$::Saber is also putting on her shoes, without saying a word.::
50784::$$$message_0438_0024_0000$$$::"...Saber?"[lr]::
50785::$$$message_0438_0024_0001$$$::My voice is annoyingly timid.[lr]::
50786::$$$message_0438_0024_0002$$$::...I can already tell what she's going to say, but I have to ask.::
50787::$$$message_0438_0025_0000$$$::"Um, well..."[lr]::
50788::$$$message_0438_0025_0001$$$::"I shall accompany you if you are going outside. Servants protect their Masters. It is dangerous to let you walk outside alone." ::
50789::$$$message_0438_0026_0000$$$::...I knew it.[lr]::
50790::$$$message_0438_0026_0001$$$::Well, this is something we would've run into eventually.[lr]::
50791::$$$message_0438_0026_0002$$$::This is a good opportunity, so I should tell her now.::
50792::$$$message_0438_0027_0000$$$::"Saber. Masters try to avoid drawing attention, right? Then, it's safe during the day. As long as I stay away from secluded areas, they won't attack me."::
50793::$$$message_0438_0028_0000$$$::"I understand. Yet, to be sure...[lr]::
50794::$$$message_0438_0028_0001$$$::Since you are still inexperienced, I need to be by your side at all times."::
50795::$$$message_0438_0029_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
50796::$$$message_0438_0029_0001$$$::At all times... Does she mean that literally...!?::
50797::$$$message_0438_0030_0000$$$::"T-t-t-t-t-t-that's stupid! We can't do that![lr]::
50798::$$$message_0438_0030_0001$$$::First of all, what are you going to do when it's time to sleep!?"::
50799::$$$message_0438_0031_0000$$$::"Are you testing me, Shirou? I must be the most alert while you are asleep. Of course I shall be standing by at your side."[lr]::
50800::$$$message_0438_0031_0001$$$::"Wha[line2]!"::
50801::$$$message_0438_0032_0000$$$::I quickly look away to hide my reddening cheeks and try to take a breath to calm myself down.[lr]::
50802::$$$message_0438_0032_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
50803::$$$message_0438_0032_0002$$$::...Damn, how stupid of me.[lr]::
50804::$$$message_0438_0032_0003$$$::It finally sinks in.[lr]::
50805::$$$message_0438_0032_0004$$$::This is what it means to fight alongside Saber.::
50806::$$$message_0438_0033_0000$$$::"Shirou, what is wrong? I do not think it is that surprising. I am just going to do what Rin did last night."[lr]::
50807::$$$message_0438_0033_0001$$$::...![lr]::
50808::$$$message_0438_0033_0002$$$::Are you kidding me, I'm gonna go crazy before we start fighting if you do that...!::
50809::$$$message_0438_0034_0000$$$::"I-I can't let that slide! I'll prepare a room for you, so use that!"[lr]::
50810::$$$message_0438_0034_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
50811::$$$message_0438_0034_0002$$$::...Ugh.[lr]::
50812::$$$message_0438_0034_0003$$$::I won't give in even if you look at me with those eyes.::
50813::$$$message_0438_0035_0000$$$::"Shirou, please put an end to this foolishness. I believe I have been patient, but cannot abide by it any further. As a Master, you continue to make unreasonable choices. I cannot obey unless you explain your reasoning."::
50814::$$$message_0438_0036_0000$$$::Saber looks up at me, frustrated.[lr]::
50815::$$$message_0438_0036_0001$$$::Her stare makes me want to curl in on myself, but I do my best to fire back.::
50816::$$$message_0438_0037_0000$$$::"T-there's no reason...! I'm telling you to just do as I say. It's fine during the day, so you should go ahead and rest!"::
50817::$$$message_0438_0038_0000$$$::"...I refuse. If you do not give me a clear reason, I will not back down."::
50818::$$$message_0438_0039_0000$$$::"You don't get it, do you...! Since you're a girl, there's no way we can sleep in the same room...!"[lr]::
50819::$$$message_0438_0039_0001$$$::Saber freezes.::
50820::$$$message_0438_0040_0000$$$::"Nnn... A-anyway, I'll prepare a room once I get back, so rest until then...!"[lr]::
50821::$$$message_0438_0040_0001$$$::I make a break for the door.::
50822::$$$message_0438_0041_0000$$$::"...Ugh, am I a kid or what...!"[lr]::
50823::$$$message_0438_0041_0001$$$::My face must be red as a tomato. I slap it as I make my way out.::
50824::$$$message_0438_0042_0000$$$::...Well, anyway...[lr]::
50825::$$$message_0438_0042_0001$$$::Saber should be convinced since I told her so firmly.[lr]::
50826::$$$message_0438_0042_0002$$$::Though I should probably apologize for yelling when I get back.::
50827::$$$message_0438_0043_0000$$$::I go down the hill.[lr]::
50828::$$$message_0438_0043_0001$$$::It takes me thirty minutes to get to the school. A fair distance normally, though I'm walking pretty fast today.[lr]::
50829::$$$message_0438_0043_0002$$$::The reason being...[lr]::
50830::$$$message_0438_0043_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50831::$$$message_0438_0043_0004$$$::She follows behind me silently.::
50832::$$$message_0438_0044_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
50833::$$$message_0438_0044_0001$$$::If I don't do anything, she'll follow me right onto the school grounds.[lr]::
50834::$$$message_0438_0044_0002$$$::I have to tell her clearly right now.::
50835::$$$message_0438_0045_0000$$$::"Saber. I said to wait at home. You're going to disobey your Master?"[lr]::
50836::$$$message_0438_0045_0001$$$::I stop and turn around.[lr]::
50837::$$$message_0438_0045_0002$$$::Saber glares at me, and after a moment of clearly mulling over what to say...::
50838::$$$message_0438_0046_0000$$$::"...Who knows. If a Servant does not obey their Master, they must have not heard them."[lr]::
50839::$$$message_0438_0046_0001$$$::She grumpily turns away from me.::
50840::$$$message_0438_0047_0000$$$::I ignore her and descend the hill.[lr]::
50841::$$$message_0438_0047_0001$$$::Behind me, ever-present...[lr]::
50842::$$$message_0438_0047_0002$$$::Saber continues to pressure me without saying a word.::
50843::$$$message_0438_0048_0000$$$::"Go home already. Do I have to tell you directly for you to understand that it's annoying to have you following me?"[lr]::
50844::$$$message_0438_0048_0001$$$::I glare at the girl that stays exactly five meters behind me.::
50845::$$$message_0438_0049_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50846::$$$message_0438_0049_0001$$$::I don't know what her problem is, but I'm met with her silent defiance.[lr]::
50847::$$$message_0438_0049_0002$$$::...Geez.[lr]::
50848::$$$message_0438_0049_0003$$$::I don't get why she's so mad, and she's just being stubborn now.::
50849::$$$message_0438_0050_0000$$$::"...Okay. Fine, do what you want."[lr]::
50850::$$$message_0438_0050_0001$$$::This time, I actually ignore her and start walking.::
50851::$$$message_0438_0051_0000$$$::I go up the hill that leads to the school.[lr]::
50852::$$$message_0438_0051_0001$$$::Miyama has a lot of hills, but this slope is especially long.[lr]::
50853::$$$message_0438_0051_0002$$$::From the school building that sits on top of the hill, you can get an unobstructed view of the whole town.::
50854::$$$message_0438_0052_0000$$$::It's a bit past 1 PM.[lr]::
50855::$$$message_0438_0052_0001$$$::Fortunately, I don't see any students around on the way.[lr]::
50856::$$$message_0438_0052_0002$$$::It must be because it's a Sunday and the ones having club practices are taking a break after eating lunch.[lr]::
50857::$$$message_0438_0052_0003$$$::"...Well, I guess I'm in luck. But it won't be like that from here."[lr]::
50858::$$$message_0438_0052_0004$$$::With a sigh, I surrender.::
50859::$$$message_0438_0053_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50860::$$$message_0438_0053_0001$$$::I turn around.[lr]::
50861::$$$message_0438_0053_0002$$$::Saber is making her way up the hill, still glaring.[lr]::
50862::$$$message_0438_0053_0003$$$::I imagine that now that I've started to ignore her, she's even more grumpy.::
50863::$$$message_0438_0054_0000$$$::"Saber."[lr]::
50864::$$$message_0438_0054_0001$$$::"Yes? You said I may do as I please."[lr]::
50865::$$$message_0438_0054_0002$$$::"...Mmm. You only listen to what's convenient for you, huh?"::
50866::$$$message_0438_0055_0000$$$::"Of course. I am a Servant, so I cannot let my Master remain in danger while I am present."::
50867::$$$message_0438_0056_0000$$$::"...Ugh. Fine, I give up. I'm raising the white flag, so you can come along. You'll understand that it's a safe place once you see it for yourself.[lr]::
50868::$$$message_0438_0056_0001$$$::Also, I'm sorry for yelling at you earlier."::
50869::$$$message_0438_0057_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
50870::$$$message_0438_0057_0001$$$::"Well, let's make up a story for you. You're a relative of my father, and you came here to visit and sightsee. Is that all right?"[lr]::
50871::$$$message_0438_0057_0002$$$::I go up the hill alongside Saber.::
50872::$$$message_0438_0058_0000$$$::"Oh... Yes. If that is what is convenient for you, then I do not mind."[lr]::
50873::$$$message_0438_0058_0001$$$::"All right, then it's decided... Yeah, you would've met them sooner or later, so it doesn't matter if I introduce you to them now."::
50874::$$$message_0438_0059_0000$$$::That's right.[lr]::
50875::$$$message_0438_0059_0001$$$::She is bound to meet Fuji-nee and Sakura if she's staying at my place.::
50876::$$$message_0438_0060_0000$$$::"Oh yeah. I forgot to ask you, but where did you get those clothes?"[lr]::
50877::$$$message_0438_0060_0001$$$::"Rin gave these to me. She said I would need regular clothes, since I cannot turn into spirit form."::
50878::$$$message_0438_0061_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50879::$$$message_0438_0061_0001$$$::That is unexpected.[lr]::
50880::$$$message_0438_0061_0002$$$::I'm surprised at Tohsaka's kindness, but I'm more surprised that she has such mature tastes.::
50881::$$$message_0438_0062_0000$$$::"What about your armor then? Is it back at the house?"[lr]::
50882::$$$message_0438_0062_0001$$$::"No. That armor is made from my magical energy. When I cut off the supply, it disappears. When it's time for battle, I can immediately protect my body with it."::
50883::$$$message_0438_0063_0000$$$::"Hm. Oh, so you can make it appear and disappear at any time?"[lr]::
50884::$$$message_0438_0063_0001$$$::"Yes. So there is no need to worry. If an enemy were to attack us here, I will protect you."::
50885::$$$message_0438_0064_0000$$$::"I see. Yeah, that's comforting."[lr]::
50886::$$$message_0438_0064_0001$$$::Maybe it's in reaction to keeping quiet until now that my honest opinion slips out.[lr]::
50887::$$$message_0438_0064_0002$$$::Saber does not answer to my slip of the tongue and continues up the hill.::
50888::$$$message_0438_0065_0000$$$::We arrive at school.[lr]::
50889::$$$message_0438_0065_0001$$$::I can only be open about this now. I can pretend that I'm showing a new transfer student around school.::
50890::$$$message_0438_0066_0000$$$::"Saber. If someone stops you to ask you something, just shake your head without saying anything. It'll be best if you pretend you don't understand Japanese."::
50891::$$$message_0438_0067_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50892::$$$message_0438_0067_0001$$$::"Saber? What's up with that grim look on your face? Don't scare me like that."::
50893::$$$message_0438_0068_0000$$$::"Huh...? Oh, I was not looking at you, Shirou. I was just surprised at how strong the traces of magical energy are here."::
50894::$$$message_0438_0069_0000$$$::"Traces of magical energy? Are you sure?"[lr]::
50895::$$$message_0438_0069_0001$$$::Saber says so, but I don't feel anything.[lr]::
50896::$$$message_0438_0069_0002$$$::...Well, not that I can sense magical energy unless it's really concentrated.::
50897::$$$message_0438_0070_0000$$$::"Yes. But it is not something you should be surprised about. Rin is in the same grade as you, correct? This is a place where a mage as strong as her has been for over a year. I am sure she has a workshop, so energy will leak out even if she attempts to hide it."[lr]::
50898::$$$message_0438_0070_0001$$$::The magical energy that Saber feels seems to be from Tohsaka.::
50899::$$$message_0438_0071_0000$$$::"Hm. That's pretty careless of her if you can sense her magical energy before you even go inside... Wait, is she in there right now!?"::
50900::$$$message_0438_0072_0000$$$::"No, it seems that Rin herself is not there. If she was, I would feel it even stronger. There are no humans resembling a mage on-site as of now.[lr]::
50901::$$$message_0438_0072_0001$$$::...Something here feels off, which bothers me, but there is no danger."::
50902::$$$message_0438_0073_0000$$$::"I told you that I'd be fine. Come on, we're going in so stay close."::
50903::$$$message_0438_0074_0000$$$::"Oh, Emiya. Are you in charge of lunch?"[lr]::
50904::$$$message_0438_0074_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50905::$$$message_0438_0074_0002$$$::It comes in handy sometimes to find someone who knows you well enough.[lr]::
50906::$$$message_0438_0074_0003$$$::Ayako Mitsuzuri, the captain of the kyudo club, even figured out my reason for being here at a glance.::
50907::$$$message_0438_0075_0000$$$::"Hey. Yeah, I'm the delivery boy as you guessed. Is Fuji-nee inside?"::
50908::$$$message_0438_0076_0000$$$::"She is. Man, you saved us. Whenever Ms. Fujimura is hungry, she's crazy. The cafeteria is closed too, so we were considering going to get food from somewhere."::
50909::$$$message_0438_0077_0000$$$::"It was that serious? Wait, were you thinking of going down to Toyoetsu by yourself?"[lr]::
50910::$$$message_0438_0077_0001$$$::"Where else is there to go? We're already short on money for equipment, so I can't spend too much on emergency food."::
50911::$$$message_0438_0078_0000$$$::As expected from Mitsuzuri, who's notorious for being stingy.[lr]::
50912::$$$message_0438_0078_0001$$$::By the way, Toyoetsu is the name of the supermarket in the shopping district.[lr]::
50913::$$$message_0438_0078_0002$$$::In the kyudo club, anyone who is taking a break and resting their arm muscles is sent on a grocery run as exercise.[lr]::
50914::$$$message_0438_0078_0003$$$::...It's a contradictory custom where it's an excuse to rest your arm, but you have to carry a lot of groceries on the way back.::
50915::$$$message_0438_0079_0000$$$::"...That sucks. Here's her lunch. It got late, but give it to Fuji-nee, will you?"[lr]::
50916::$$$message_0438_0079_0001$$$::I hold out the paper bag.::
50917::$$$message_0438_0080_0000$$$::"Wow, that's a fancy three-layered set. Nice, I haven't seen that in a while. You sure are good at this sort of thing."[lr]::
50918::$$$message_0438_0080_0001$$$::I don't know what she's happy about, but she smiles.::
50919::$$$message_0438_0081_0000$$$::...Well, in comparison, she's good at mass production.[lr]::
50920::$$$message_0438_0081_0001$$$::Mitsuzuri is usually the one who's in charge of dinner at our training camps, and she surprises everyone every time.[lr]::
50921::$$$message_0438_0081_0002$$$::The world of cooking is vast, considering how her curry was good despite having basically whole potatoes in it.::
50922::$$$message_0438_0082_0000$$$::...Well, anyway...[lr]::
50923::$$$message_0438_0082_0001$$$::Mitsuzuri only looks inside the bag but doesn't take it.::
50924::$$$message_0438_0083_0000$$$::"Hey. No need to tease, just take the bag. Isn't it chaotic in there with Fuji-nee going wild?"::
50925::$$$message_0438_0084_0000$$$::"Yeah. If you think so, you should go in already and hand it to her.[lr]::
50926::$$$message_0438_0084_0001$$$::First of all, you should know she'll obviously get mad if I say I turned you away here. I don't want to be chewed out. Accept your fate and go in."[lr]::
50927::$$$message_0438_0084_0002$$$::She points to the dojo with her chin.::
50928::$$$message_0438_0085_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
50929::$$$message_0438_0085_0001$$$::True enough, it would be scary later on if I don't at least go to see her.[lr]::
50930::$$$message_0438_0085_0002$$$::It's not like I came here for practice, so I can just leave as soon as I hand her the lunch.::
50931::$$$message_0438_0086_0000$$$::I give up and head to the archery range.[lr]::
50932::$$$message_0438_0086_0001$$$::"But hey, Mitsuzuri. You've been here long enough now, so you should at least check if Fuji-nee has her lunch in the morning. It's too creepy imagining a teacher looking around at her students' lunches."::
50933::$$$message_0438_0087_0000$$$::"Well, I was tired this morning. I've been busy, so I don't have much time to spare. Well, I guess there's no use complaining to you..."::
50934::$$$message_0438_0088_0000$$$::Then, she suddenly comes close and whispers in my ear.[lr]::
50935::$$$message_0438_0088_0001$$$::"...So, Emiya. Who's that? She's so beautiful. Do you know her?"[lr]::
50936::$$$message_0438_0088_0002$$$::She asks me in a nervous voice.::
50937::$$$message_0438_0089_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50938::$$$message_0438_0089_0001$$$::Yeah... I'm sure anyone would be surprised seeing Saber.[lr]::
50939::$$$message_0438_0089_0002$$$::Especially since she's trying to follow me inside the archery range without saying anything.::
50940::$$$message_0438_0090_0000$$$::"So? Is that an acquaintance of yours?"[lr]::
50941::$$$message_0438_0090_0001$$$::"It's complicated to explain, but it would be helpful if you could say that she is. Also, if you can explain to everyone so that they won't make a fuss about her when we go in, I'll be forever in your debt."::
50942::$$$message_0438_0091_0000$$$::"...Okay. I'm curious what the situation is, but I like the bargain. Don't take it back later, okay, Emiya?"[lr]::
50943::$$$message_0438_0091_0001$$$::I open the door.[lr]::
50944::$$$message_0438_0091_0002$$$::Saber silently follows behind Mitsuzuri and me.::
50945::$$$message_0438_0092_0000$$$::We enter the dojo.[lr]::
50946::$$$message_0438_0092_0001$$$::...The archery range after lunch break is noisy like a battlefield.::
50947::$$$message_0438_0093_0000$$$::"Ms. Fujimura...! Misaki is saying her stomach hurts so much she's about to die...! How old were those crackers!?"[lr]::
50948::$$$message_0438_0093_0001$$$::"That's just a stomach ache! I also ate that and I'm fine, so just give her some tea!"::
50949::$$$message_0438_0094_0000$$$::"Ms. Taiga! I'm going to practice with the target, so please let me move the stove! It's cold in the corner of the dojo."[lr]::
50950::$$$message_0438_0094_0001$$$::"Okay, since you've got some nerve using that name, go run three laps around the range in shorts. We're gonna whip you into shape."::
50951::$$$message_0438_0095_0000$$$::"Ms. Fujimura! We have someone bleeding over here! Kitako cut her cheek with the bowstring!"[lr]::
50952::$$$message_0438_0095_0001$$$::"Hmm, you don't have to go to the nurse's office for a wound like this.[lr]::
50953::$$$message_0438_0095_0002$$$::Just rub some aloe on. It's planted on the hill in the back."::
50954::$$$message_0438_0096_0000$$$::"Ouch. Geez, why is this bow bent backwards? I can't string it like this."[lr]::
50955::$$$message_0438_0096_0001$$$::"Hey! Don't string it pushing from the top. You're still young, so get someone to help you if it's hard. If it flips and comes apart, your neck will be broken.[lr]::
50956::$$$message_0438_0096_0002$$$::That is, I'll break your neck if you damage our bows."::
50957::$$$message_0438_0097_0000$$$::"Ms. Fujimura! There's no powder! M-my hand's slipping!"[lr]::
50958::$$$message_0438_0097_0001$$$::"Oh, really? Can someone go to the storage room and bring the stock?"::
50959::$$$message_0438_0098_0000$$$::"Sensei, we're out of stock! I think it's because you forgot to order more the other day!"[lr]::
50960::$$$message_0438_0098_0001$$$::"Oh... Then, the first years are to go to the baseball club and steal some rosin bags!"[lr]::
50961::$$$message_0438_0098_0002$$$::"God, she's nuts...!"::
50962::$$$message_0438_0099_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
50963::$$$message_0438_0099_0001$$$::Man.[lr]::
50964::$$$message_0438_0099_0002$$$::This place doesn't change at all.::
50965::$$$message_0438_0100_0000$$$::"...Well."[lr]::
50966::$$$message_0438_0100_0001$$$::I can't stick around this pandemonium forever.::
50967::$$$message_0438_0101_0000$$$::"Oh, great timing. Hey, Sakura..."[lr]::
50968::$$$message_0438_0101_0001$$$::I call out to the girl in front of the bow rack.[lr]::
50969::$$$message_0438_0101_0002$$$::"Huh, Senpai...!?"[lr]::
50970::$$$message_0438_0101_0003$$$::Sakura returns the bow she is holding and runs to me, bewildered.::
50971::$$$message_0438_0102_0000$$$::"Senpai! W-why did you come here today? Um, could it be, um..."[lr]::
50972::$$$message_0438_0102_0001$$$::"Yeah, I brought lunch for Fuji-nee.[lr]::
50973::$$$message_0438_0102_0002$$$::I'm sorry, but can you take this to that manic teacher over there?"::
50974::$$$message_0438_0103_0000$$$::"Oh... Yes, right. Come to think of it, she was making a call."[lr]::
50975::$$$message_0438_0103_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
50976::$$$message_0438_0103_0002$$$::I'm not sure where her smile goes, but it vanishes at the same time she slumps her shoulders.::
50977::$$$message_0438_0104_0000$$$::"Yeah, that'd be the one. When she gets hungry, Fuji-nee becomes a dictator, huh? It might be too late now, but she can have what I made.[lr]::
50978::$$$message_0438_0104_0001$$$::Also, sorry I came home late last night. Thanks for making dinner."::
50979::$$$message_0438_0105_0000$$$::"...Yes. Thank you for saying so, but..."[lr]::
50980::$$$message_0438_0105_0001$$$::She looks behind me.[lr]::
50981::$$$message_0438_0105_0002$$$::There stands a golden-haired girl that is out of place in the archery range.::
50982::$$$message_0438_0106_0000$$$::"...Um, Senpai?"[lr]::
50983::$$$message_0438_0106_0001$$$::"Hm? What, am I actually too late? I made yours just in case too..."[lr]::
50984::$$$message_0438_0106_0002$$$::"No, that's not true. I-I'm hungry too...! ...Um, I gave half of my lunch to Ms. Fujimura."::
50985::$$$message_0438_0107_0000$$$::"Yeah, that's what I thought. I made yours so that you can eat it right away, so it shouldn't take that much time.[lr]::
50986::$$$message_0438_0107_0001$$$::...Well, if that's the case for everyone, I don't think anyone would complain about resuming lunch."::
50987::$$$message_0438_0108_0000$$$::"Y-you're right! Um, then thank you for the meal... Senpai, will you be at the dojo all day today?"::
50988::$$$message_0438_0109_0000$$$::"I think so. Since I'm here, I might as well stay until practice is over. I skipped yesterday, so I'll make dinner today. And you should come and eat with us."::
50989::$$$message_0438_0110_0000$$$::"...Yes, I'd love to. I'll go get Ms. Fujimura. Senpai, please don't just drop off lunch and go somewhere, okay?"::
50990::$$$message_0438_0111_0000$$$::Sakura goes to get Fuji-nee in a hurry.[lr]::
50991::$$$message_0438_0111_0001$$$::When I look back, I see the members buzzing in conversation over Saber, and Mitsuzuri going around explaining things.::
50992::$$$message_0438_0112_0000$$$::   Well...[lr]::
50993::$$$message_0438_0112_0001$$$::For now, I think I've accomplished my initial goal.::
50994::$$$message_0438_0113_0000$$$::"Oh, I'm so full. The sugar's flowing to my brain, so I'm finally back to my regular self."::
50995::$$$message_0438_0114_0000$$$::The break room.[lr]::
50996::$$$message_0438_0114_0001$$$::Fuji-nee sips tea while she eats some sweet bean jelly.[lr]::
50997::$$$message_0438_0114_0002$$$::It must be because Fuji-nee is calm now, but the sound of bowstring twangs and arrows cutting through the air is all that echoes through the dojo.::
50998::$$$message_0438_0115_0000$$$::"Ms. Fujimura. I'll be taking my turn at the range, if you'll excuse me."[lr]::
50999::$$$message_0438_0115_0001$$$::"Right-o! Oh, can you tell Mitsuzuri to come here? I need to talk to her."::
51000::$$$message_0438_0116_0000$$$::"Okay. Senpai, please make yourself comfortable. If you can, I would appreciate it if you coached me."[lr]::
51001::$$$message_0438_0116_0001$$$::Sakura bows and leaves.[lr]::
51002::$$$message_0438_0116_0002$$$::But, as she does so...[lr]::
51003::$$$message_0438_0116_0003$$$::She stares uneasily at Saber, who is silently watching by the wall.::
51004::$$$message_0438_0117_0000$$$::"So? What are you gonna do after this, Shirou? I'll finish practice by five, but do you want to stay and watch?"::
51005::$$$message_0438_0118_0000$$$::"...Hmm..."[lr]::
51006::$$$message_0438_0118_0001$$$::What should I do?[lr]::
51007::$$$message_0438_0118_0002$$$::Just from what I see, Saber seems to be gazing at the archery range with interest herself, so I should...[lr]::
