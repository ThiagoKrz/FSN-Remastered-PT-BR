77704::$$$message_0723_0000_0000$$$::"Hah, hah!"[lr]::
77705::$$$message_0723_0000_0001$$$::I make a straight dash for the park without looking back.[lr]::
77706::$$$message_0723_0000_0002$$$::The leaking magical energy is huge and incredibly repulsive.[lr]::
77707::$$$message_0723_0000_0003$$$::It's like an oil spill in the middle of a clear stream.[lr]::
77708::$$$message_0723_0000_0004$$$::Even I can sense power as [font italic=true]dense[font italic=false] as this.::
77709::$$$message_0723_0001_0000$$$::Saber halts.[lr]::
77710::$$$message_0723_0001_0001$$$::Her eyes grasp the situation faster than I can.::
77711::$$$message_0723_0002_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
77712::$$$message_0723_0002_0001$$$::I tremble.[lr]::
77713::$$$message_0723_0002_0002$$$::The feeling in my frenzied mind can only be described as revulsion and terror.::
77714::$$$message_0723_0003_0000$$$::...It was like seeing a vampire out of folktales.[lr]::
77715::$$$message_0723_0003_0001$$$::A black-clad woman has her mouth on the neck of an unconscious woman.[lr]::
77716::$$$message_0723_0003_0002$$$::Biting. Sucking.[lr]::
77717::$$$message_0723_0003_0003$$$::Drops of fresh red blood fall from her lips.::
77718::$$$message_0723_0004_0000$$$::It was...eating a person.[lr]::
77719::$$$message_0723_0004_0001$$$::I don't mean that it was chewing on their flesh.[lr]::
77720::$$$message_0723_0004_0002$$$::The woman in black was sucking on a person's entire being: her victim's mind and memories.[lr]::
77721::$$$message_0723_0004_0003$$$::The victim doesn't even twitch.[lr]::
77722::$$$message_0723_0004_0004$$$::It's as if the woman, getting life sucked out of her by the minute, has been turned into a living doll.::
77723::$$$message_0723_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77724::$$$message_0723_0005_0001$$$::I can't come up with any words.[lr]::
77725::$$$message_0723_0005_0002$$$::I'm not surprised that the vampire-like [font italic=true]thing[font italic=false] is a Servant.[lr]::
77726::$$$message_0723_0005_0003$$$::There's an unmistakably human figure watching the woman in black from behind.::
77727::$$$message_0723_0006_0000$$$::"Well, well. If it isn't Emiya. I'm amazed your bumbling has gotten you this far."::
77728::$$$message_0723_0007_0000$$$::"Shinji, you[line2]"[lr]::
77729::$$$message_0723_0007_0001$$$::My head grinds to a halt.[lr]::
77730::$$$message_0723_0007_0002$$$::I can't figure out what's happening.[lr]::
77731::$$$message_0723_0007_0003$$$::I can't make a clear decision.[lr]::
77732::$$$message_0723_0007_0004$$$::What is he doing here?[lr]::
77733::$$$message_0723_0007_0005$$$::What's that book in his hand?[lr]::
77734::$$$message_0723_0007_0006$$$::How can he laugh when someone's dying?[lr]::
77735::$$$message_0723_0007_0007$$$::How is this absurd situation happening in front of me!?::
77736::$$$message_0723_0008_0000$$$::"What's wrong, Emiya? You went all stiff. The Servant drew you out here, didn't she? You gotta man up. We even put on a show so obvious even you could understand it."::
77737::$$$message_0723_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77738::$$$message_0723_0009_0001$$$::Shinji's familiar voice doesn't sound very familiar at all.[lr]::
77739::$$$message_0723_0009_0002$$$::It's strangely high-pitched.[lr]::
77740::$$$message_0723_0009_0003$$$::There's something utterly repugnant about it.::
77741::$$$message_0723_0010_0000$$$::"...Did you kill her?"[lr]::
77742::$$$message_0723_0010_0001$$$::My hands ball into fists.[lr]::
77743::$$$message_0723_0010_0002$$$::I don't even look at the Servant in front of Shinji.[lr]::
77744::$$$message_0723_0010_0003$$$::My mind is frozen.[lr]::
77745::$$$message_0723_0010_0004$$$::Something far stronger than me[line2]a Servant I should do everything in my power to flee from[line2]is right in front of me, and it doesn't feel threatening at all.[lr]::
77746::$$$message_0723_0010_0005$$$::My rational mind has gone out the window.::
77747::$$$message_0723_0011_0000$$$::"Did I [font italic=true]kill[font italic=false] her? Servants feed on humans, you moron! What did you expect?"[lr]::
77748::$$$message_0723_0011_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
77749::$$$message_0723_0012_0000$$$::"I think it's in bad taste, but what else can I do? They need to eat live ones. The only way to maintain a Servant is to keep giving it magical energy. You're out here looking for prey too, aren't you?"::
77750::$$$message_0723_0013_0000$$$::The black-clad Servant doesn't move.[lr]::
77751::$$$message_0723_0013_0001$$$::It's like a well-trained attack dog,[lr]::
77752::$$$message_0723_0013_0002$$$::one that won't act without orders.[lr]::
77753::$$$message_0723_0013_0003$$$::A doll that won't even move without orders from its Master.[lr]::
77754::$$$message_0723_0013_0004$$$::But once that order comes down, it becomes a devil that will murder without hesitation.::
77755::$$$message_0723_0014_0000$$$::"Back off."[lr]::
77756::$$$message_0723_0014_0001$$$::I stand in front of the attack dog and give my warning.[lr]::
77757::$$$message_0723_0014_0002$$$::There's no time.[lr]::
77758::$$$message_0723_0014_0003$$$::If I hurry, I might be able to save this woman.::
77759::$$$message_0723_0015_0000$$$::"Huh? What'd you just say? Are you talking to me, Emiya!?[lr]::
77760::$$$message_0723_0015_0001$$$::Ha, no thanks. You can fight me if you want the leftovers.[lr]::
77761::$$$message_0723_0015_0002$$$::That's your familiar, isn't it?"::
77762::$$$message_0723_0016_0000$$$::"Shinji."[lr]::
77763::$$$message_0723_0016_0001$$$::"C'mon, show me what you got, Emiya. I went to all this trouble because I want to see Servants fight. Aren't you a Master? What are you shaking in your boots for? Makes you no different from that 'girl' there!"::
77764::$$$message_0723_0017_0000$$$::"...So you're not going to back off?"[lr]::
77765::$$$message_0723_0017_0001$$$::"Damn, you're annoying. You'll just have to make me.[lr]::
77766::$$$message_0723_0017_0002$$$::But, y'know...[lr]::
77767::$$$message_0723_0017_0003$$$::Go ahead and keep shaking. You're going to end up feeling the pain, anyway."::
77768::$$$message_0723_0018_0000$$$::Shinji's eyes burn with animosity.[lr]::
77769::$$$message_0723_0018_0001$$$::As if taking that as a signal, the black-clad Servant sinks to the ground, and[line2][lr]::
77770::$$$message_0723_0018_0002$$$::"Here she comes! Get behind me, Shirou!"[lr]::
77771::$$$message_0723_0018_0003$$$::Saber steps forth to meet the ghastly attacker.::
77772::$$$message_0723_0019_0000$$$::The two shadows collide.[lr]::
77773::$$$message_0723_0019_0001$$$::In an instant, Saber is fully armed and intercepting the other Servant with her invisible sword.::
77774::$$$message_0723_0020_0000$$$::Steel clashes against steel.[lr]::
77775::$$$message_0723_0020_0001$$$::Saber, with a firmly planted stance, faces down the bounding, whirling Servant.::
77776::$$$message_0723_0021_0000$$$::She can't keep up with her opponent's speed, so she plants her feet and solidifies her guard.[lr]::
77777::$$$message_0723_0021_0001$$$::The enemy's long hair whips through the air, hounding her cautious prey.::
77778::$$$message_0723_0022_0000$$$::"Ha! She's just a scarecrow! A third-rate Servant for a third-rate Master!"[lr]::
77779::$$$message_0723_0022_0001$$$::Like me, Shinji backs away from the fight, cackling all the while.[lr]::
77780::$$$message_0723_0022_0002$$$::...I don't know why he became a Master, but he doesn't seem to be a mage.[lr]::
77781::$$$message_0723_0022_0003$$$::Shinji isn't doing anything to support his Servant.[lr]::
77782::$$$message_0723_0022_0004$$$::Which means he might be someone who coincidentally became a Master, like me...::
77783::$$$message_0723_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77784::$$$message_0723_0023_0001$$$::After taking several dagger strikes, Saber's feet stop.[lr]::
77785::$$$message_0723_0023_0002$$$::Her face looks pained.[lr]::
77786::$$$message_0723_0023_0003$$$::It's tinged with something resembling irritation at the agile opponent harrying her.::
77787::$$$message_0723_0024_0000$$$::"Good, Rider! Finish her, I don't mind![lr]::
77788::$$$message_0723_0024_0001$$$::I've followed Grandpa's orders! You're unstoppable enough to take out Emiya's Servant!"::
77789::$$$message_0723_0025_0000$$$::    The dark shadow gets faster.[lr]::
77790::$$$message_0723_0025_0001$$$::Rider obeys her Master's command, accelerating and aiming to take Saber's head...[lr]::
77791::$$$message_0723_0025_0002$$$::...but as she begins her strike, the shadow is cut down the middle.::
77792::$$$message_0723_0026_0000$$$::   The fight was decided in an instant.[lr]::
77793::$$$message_0723_0026_0001$$$::Saber's sword finds Rider's body, sending the Servant streaking through the air.[lr]::
77794::$$$message_0723_0026_0002$$$::It's as magnificent as sending a sandbag flying with a bat.[lr]::
77795::$$$message_0723_0026_0003$$$::The batter in this case is Saber, while the sandbag is Rider.::
77796::$$$message_0723_0027_0000$$$::".........Huh?"[lr]::
77797::$$$message_0723_0027_0001$$$::The tension in the air changes.[lr]::
77798::$$$message_0723_0027_0002$$$::Shinji stares at the wounded Rider in shock.[lr]::
77799::$$$message_0723_0027_0003$$$::"...No way."[lr]::
77800::$$$message_0723_0027_0004$$$::Astonished, I watch as Saber lowers her sword with a bored expression.::
77801::$$$message_0723_0028_0000$$$::"W-what the fuck? What's wrong with you!?"[lr]::
77802::$$$message_0723_0028_0001$$$::He's giving her an earful.[lr]::
77803::$$$message_0723_0028_0002$$$::Shinji runs over to Rider and screams at her. She's sprawled on the ground, her belly cut open.::
77804::$$$message_0723_0029_0000$$$::"Who gave you permission to die!? I can't believe you! This is insubordination! How could you lose to [font italic=true]Emiya's[font italic=false] Servant despite having me as your Master!?"::
77805::$$$message_0723_0030_0000$$$::"Ugh... Argh..."[lr]::
77806::$$$message_0723_0030_0001$$$::Rider does her best to rise out of the pool of blood.[lr]::
77807::$$$message_0723_0030_0002$$$::But she can't stand.[lr]::
77808::$$$message_0723_0030_0003$$$::She's taken a critical wound. Even if she's a Servant, she won't survive long unless she gets treated soon.::
77809::$$$message_0723_0031_0000$$$::"Damn it! Stand up and fight, you walking corpse! You're not even alive, so who cares if you get injured!? Goddammit, what the fuck are you just sitting there for!? You're making me look like a loser!"[lr]::
77810::$$$message_0723_0031_0001$$$::Shinji verbally abuses Rider.[lr]::
77811::$$$message_0723_0031_0002$$$::Saber doesn't approve.::
77812::$$$message_0723_0032_0000$$$::"Blame yourself before you blame Rider. No matter how excellent a Heroic Spirit is, she cannot display her true worth without a worthy Master."::
77813::$$$message_0723_0033_0000$$$::"Ngh...! I said stand up, y-y-you idiot! It's your job to protect your Master! If you can't win, at least be a meat shield!"::
77814::$$$message_0723_0034_0000$$$::"...That is futile. Even if you use a Command Spell, you will not be able to heal Rider. And if you force it on her while she's near death, she will still be unable to protect you.[lr]::
77815::$$$message_0723_0034_0001$$$::This is the end, Master of Rider.[lr]::
77816::$$$message_0723_0034_0002$$$::As much as it pains me to say it, my Master offers you a chance to surrender. Will you forfeit your Command Spells and admit defeat?"::
77817::$$$message_0723_0035_0000$$$::"Sh-shut up! Don't tell me what to do, monster! Stand up, Rider! [font italic=true]I'm[font italic=false] your Master! How dare you disobey me, when you're just a dog!"::
77818::$$$message_0723_0036_0000$$$::"Ngh...ugh...ergh!"[lr]::
77819::$$$message_0723_0036_0001$$$::Sparks dance.[lr]::
77820::$$$message_0723_0036_0002$$$::Rider writhes with pain as blue-white lightning wrecks her body, punishing her for failing to comply with Shinji's command.::
77821::$$$message_0723_0037_0000$$$::...What an awful cycle.[lr]::
77822::$$$message_0723_0037_0001$$$::Rider's in no condition to fight anymore.[lr]::
77823::$$$message_0723_0037_0002$$$::But Shinji's command punishes her for being unable to stand up. Her wounds deepen, and Rider draws closer to her death.::
77824::$$$message_0723_0038_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77825::$$$message_0723_0038_0001$$$::Saber reaches for Shinji.::
77826::$$$message_0723_0039_0000$$$::"Eep! Stand up! Move, Rider! If you're gonna die, at least take her with you!"[lr]::
77827::$$$message_0723_0039_0001$$$::Rider reacts to Shinji's order.[lr]::
77828::$$$message_0723_0039_0002$$$::    Her body begins to move, her death ever more certain.::
77829::$$$message_0723_0040_0000$$$::Then,[lr]::
77830::$$$message_0723_0040_0001$$$::"Enough. It seems you weren't useful after all, Shinji."[lr]::
77831::$$$message_0723_0040_0002$$$::A wizened voice interrupts the tension.::
77832::$$$message_0723_0041_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
77833::$$$message_0723_0041_0001$$$::Something roars into flame.[lr]::
77834::$$$message_0723_0041_0002$$$::"Eh? Huh!? Th-the book is burning!"[lr]::
77835::$$$message_0723_0041_0003$$$::The book Shinji was holding is on fire.::
77836::$$$message_0723_0042_0000$$$::"Why!? Damn it, stop! Go out! Why is this thing burning!?"[lr]::
77837::$$$message_0723_0042_0001$$$::He tries to smother it, but it's too late.[lr]::
77838::$$$message_0723_0042_0002$$$::The book burns to ash. In the same instant,[lr]::
77839::$$$message_0723_0042_0003$$$::Rider disappears without a trace.::
77840::$$$message_0723_0043_0000$$$::"...Good grief. I never expected much from you, but this is indeed pathetic. I gave you a chance because you're my grandson, but I should have trusted my better judgment."[lr]::
77841::$$$message_0723_0043_0001$$$::Where was he lurking all this time?[lr]::
77842::$$$message_0723_0043_0002$$$::The old man, Zouken Matou, seemed to have suddenly crept out of the darkness.::
77843::$$$message_0723_0044_0000$$$::"G-Grand...father? Was that[line2]"[lr]::
77844::$$$message_0723_0044_0001$$$::"Who else would I be, you little fool? You nearly got your Servant killed. And you still claim to be of my blood?"::
77845::$$$message_0723_0045_0000$$$::"...! W-w-why'd you interrupt me!? All I needed to do was win! [font italic=true]I'm[font italic=false] the heir to the Matou family, so I knew I couldn't afford to lose to guys like him!"::
77846::$$$message_0723_0046_0000$$$::Shinji scrambles over the old man as if clinging to his feet.[lr]::
77847::$$$message_0723_0046_0001$$$::Now that he's lost Rider and been cornered by us, he has no choice but to rely on the old man.[lr]::
77848::$$$message_0723_0046_0002$$$::And yet...::
77849::$$$message_0723_0047_0000$$$::"...You half-wit. I never once expected a failure like you to succeed. I simply wanted to see you rise to the challenge despite your weakness, as is our way.[lr]::
77850::$$$message_0723_0047_0001$$$::But look at you, besmirching the Makiri name. You're as useless as your father."::
77851::$$$message_0723_0048_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]I'm...the same as my father...?"[lr]::
77852::$$$message_0723_0048_0001$$$::"Even less than him, you cretin. Your incompetent father gave birth to an utterly hopeless, defective child.[lr]::
77853::$$$message_0723_0048_0002$$$::...I tried to ignore the signs and have some hopes for you, but you're a complete disappointment. Your mind is as worthless as your blood.[lr]::
77854::$$$message_0723_0048_0003$$$::The Matou bloodline has ended with you."::
77855::$$$message_0723_0049_0000$$$::The old man ignores Shinji and walks forward.[lr]::
77856::$$$message_0723_0049_0001$$$::Saber shifts slightly backward, as if repulsed by him.::
77857::$$$message_0723_0050_0000$$$::"...Hm, I see. It's little wonder Rider lost. You are a Heroic Spirit of some renown. I seem to recall a Servant as powerful as this in one of the past wars."[lr]::
77858::$$$message_0723_0050_0001$$$::"..."::
77859::$$$message_0723_0051_0000$$$::"Still, I can't simply let him die. He is still my flesh and blood, as sad as that is. I will risk myself to preserve his life, at least. Haha. Family love truly is a matter of life and death."::
77860::$$$message_0723_0052_0000$$$::...I'm surprised.[lr]::
77861::$$$message_0723_0052_0001$$$::Apparently, he's trying to give Shinji a chance to escape.[lr]::
77862::$$$message_0723_0052_0002$$$::Is that why Zouken is going to face Saber and protect the cowering Shinji?::
77863::$$$message_0723_0053_0000$$$::"Hurry up and leave. You're no longer a Master now that the book of contract is destroyed. If you survive, these two won't come after you. Go live out a pointless life, just like your father."[lr]::
77864::$$$message_0723_0053_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
77865::$$$message_0723_0053_0002$$$::Shinji slinks away from Saber's gaze, all while glaring at the old man.::
77866::$$$message_0723_0054_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77867::$$$message_0723_0054_0001$$$::Saber doesn't give chase.[lr]::
77868::$$$message_0723_0054_0002$$$::She's probably decided[line2]for my sake[line2]that Shinji isn't worth pursuing now that he's no longer a Master.::
77869::$$$message_0723_0055_0000$$$::He crawls away from the battleground.[lr]::
77870::$$$message_0723_0055_0001$$$::Once he reaches the park exit, he takes one last look back,[lr]::
77871::$$$message_0723_0055_0002$$$::and runs off into the night.::
77872::$$$message_0723_0056_0000$$$::I feel my stomach turn sour.[lr]::
77873::$$$message_0723_0056_0001$$$::There is a smell of rotten meat coming from somewhere.::
77874::$$$message_0723_0057_0000$$$::"Oh, so you'll let him go? ...I see, I see. You must not want to dirty your sword on such a lowly pest."::
77875::$$$message_0723_0058_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
77876::$$$message_0723_0058_0001$$$::Saber keeps still, squarely facing the old man.[lr]::
77877::$$$message_0723_0058_0002$$$::...It feels like she's trying to block him from looking directly at me.::
77878::$$$message_0723_0059_0000$$$::"Saber. Back off. I know this old man. I want to talk to him."[lr]::
77879::$$$message_0723_0059_0001$$$::"I can't do that. This man is not human. There is nothing worth saying to him, and we should not listen to anything he says."::
77880::$$$message_0723_0060_0000$$$::"...I know that. But I have questions I need to ask him. Please, I'll be quick. I'll let you decide whether to fight him afterward."[lr]::
77881::$$$message_0723_0060_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
77882::$$$message_0723_0060_0002$$$::Saber backs up, just slightly.[lr]::
77883::$$$message_0723_0060_0003$$$::She's giving me a chance to speak to him, but she isn't going to let me pass.::
77884::$$$message_0723_0061_0000$$$::"Thanks.[lr]::
77885::$$$message_0723_0061_0001$$$::...So. How do you explain this?"[lr]::
77886::$$$message_0723_0061_0002$$$::"How very brazen of you to simply demand answers.[lr]::
77887::$$$message_0723_0061_0003$$$::I don't mind hearing your questions, but I don't know what you're asking me."::
77888::$$$message_0723_0062_0000$$$::"I'm talking about Shinji. Why did he become a Master? It sounds like you're the one who put him up to it."::
77889::$$$message_0723_0063_0000$$$::"Oh, that's what you want to know? I'm happy to tell you. As you said, I chose Shinji to be a Master. I've long since retired from the field, as you can no doubt tell.[lr]::
77890::$$$message_0723_0063_0001$$$::Since I can't fight, I yielded the limelight to my grandson."[lr]::
77891::$$$message_0723_0063_0002$$$::"You gave up your rights as a Master? So that means..."::
77892::$$$message_0723_0064_0000$$$::"Mm. He's just like you, scion of Emiya.[lr]::
77893::$$$message_0723_0064_0001$$$::When he learned of the Holy Grail, he[line2]not I[line2]made a contract with a Servant. Like you, he is the last of a line walking the ways of the wise.[lr]::
77894::$$$message_0723_0064_0002$$$::Surely you can understand entrusting one's unfulfilled dreams to one's descendants."::
77895::$$$message_0723_0065_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77896::$$$message_0723_0065_0001$$$::So...what?[lr]::
77897::$$$message_0723_0065_0002$$$::As a rule, only mages become Masters.[lr]::
77898::$$$message_0723_0065_0003$$$::Is the old man saying that Shinji studied magecraft as a family tradition?::
77899::$$$message_0723_0066_0000$$$::"Is the Matou family[line2]are you a magical lineage?"[lr]::
77900::$$$message_0723_0066_0001$$$::"You didn't know? Both the Tohsaka and Matou families have deep roots in this land.[lr]::
77901::$$$message_0723_0066_0002$$$::That said, our bloodline fell into decline long ago.[lr]::
77902::$$$message_0723_0066_0003$$$::In practice, Tohsaka rules over this land. We Matous just survive by virtue of our old privilege."::
77903::$$$message_0723_0067_0000$$$::"Tohsaka...? Th-then, Tohsaka knows you? That the Matous are a family of mages!?"::
77904::$$$message_0723_0068_0000$$$::"Of course she does. Our families are old friends. Though we've fallen out since the ritual turned into a bloody conflict, we were once comrades who sought the same grand dream. Our association has continued in ways beyond the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
77905::$$$message_0723_0068_0001$$$::Ah, yes. They let us adopt one of their[r]::
77906::$$$message_0723_0068_0002$$$:: daughters, once.[lr]::
77907::$$$message_0723_0068_0003$$$::I wonder how much of a mage their apprentice has grown into these past ten years."::
77908::$$$message_0723_0069_0000$$$::He lets out a hearty chuckle.[lr]::
77909::$$$message_0723_0069_0001$$$::Zouken Matou laughs in amusement at whatever the Tohsaka family must be feeling.::
77910::$$$message_0723_0070_0000$$$::"...You said that you're old friends with the Tohsakas. Then does that mean the Matous have been around since the first Holy Grail War?"::
77911::$$$message_0723_0071_0000$$$::"Hm. We used to be called Makiri.[lr]::
77912::$$$message_0723_0071_0001$$$::We adopted 'Matou' to assimilate into this country, but that seems to have been a mistake. The land of this country does not suit us. Over the past two centuries, our blood has grown diluted, ending in the flawed heir you saw before you."::
77913::$$$message_0723_0072_0000$$$::"Matou..."[lr]::
77914::$$$message_0723_0072_0001$$$::It was just a conversion of their old name, Makiri.[lr]::
77915::$$$message_0723_0072_0002$$$::Then if Shinji belongs to a mage family, Sakura...::
77916::$$$message_0723_0073_0000$$$::"Hm? Oh, it's simply a play on words. We chose the name to conceal our identities, but names carry great importance. It may be a fake name, but it needs to have a connection to our true name."[lr]::
77917::$$$message_0723_0073_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
77918::$$$message_0723_0073_0002$$$::I don't care about that.[lr]::
77919::$$$message_0723_0073_0003$$$::There's only one thing that I need to know.::
77920::$$$message_0723_0074_0000$$$::"Then, Sakura... Is Sakura a Master like Shinji?"[lr]::
77921::$$$message_0723_0074_0001$$$::"What an odd question. Sakura, a Master? That's inconcievable. It seems your father didn't give you a proper education."::
77922::$$$message_0723_0075_0000$$$::"Inconcievable? Sakura doesn't have the talent to be a mage?"::
77923::$$$message_0723_0076_0000$$$::"The problem is more fundamental than that.[lr]::
77924::$$$message_0723_0076_0001$$$::Mage lineages are essentially unilineal. Except in the greatest of families, the secrets are never taught to anyone other than the appointed heir.[lr]::
77925::$$$message_0723_0076_0002$$$::That's doubly so for siblings. There is no need for two heirs. If the Matou name hadn't declined, then we might have been able to adopt someone, but we don't have any Magic Circuits to pass on to begin with."::
77926::$$$message_0723_0077_0000$$$::"Then Sakura is..."[lr]::
77927::$$$message_0723_0077_0001$$$::"Shinji is the Master, so the conclusion is obvious. A sibling not even chosen as the heir would not be inducted into our arts.[lr]::
77928::$$$message_0723_0077_0002$$$::...I did consider the sister if the brother turned out to be of no use, but our role in this contest has already concluded. There's little point in sending out an ignorant grandchild to fight in the Holy Grail War."::
77929::$$$message_0723_0078_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77930::$$$message_0723_0078_0001$$$::I feel a sense of relief in my chest.[lr]::
77931::$$$message_0723_0078_0002$$$::...Thank god.[lr]::
77932::$$$message_0723_0078_0003$$$::I was surprised to hear that the Matous were a mage family, but the problem is Shinji being a Master.[lr]::
77933::$$$message_0723_0078_0004$$$::Still, I can rest easy knowing that Sakura won't be involved in any deathmatches.::
77934::$$$message_0723_0079_0000$$$::"You said you're done with this battle. So Shinji won't fight anymore, you're retired, and Sakura has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War."::
77935::$$$message_0723_0080_0000$$$::"Yes. But I can't guarantee that Shinji will agree.[lr]::
77936::$$$message_0723_0080_0001$$$::That boy is obsessed with being a mage.[lr]::
77937::$$$message_0723_0080_0002$$$::To our shame, the Matou blood has thinned ever since we settled in this land. The sad display you just saw is our final heir. The Matou children no longer have any Magic Circuits to speak of."::
77938::$$$message_0723_0081_0000$$$::"...By jove, where did he even learn of such secrets? His head is filled with conceits of being a chosen one, even as he grapples with the inferiority complex of being taught how flawed he was from birth.[lr]::
77939::$$$message_0723_0081_0001$$$::Perhaps it was a mistake to let him run free, but there's little to be done about it now. If he refuses to give up even when you've handed him such an obvious loss, then there's not much I can do."::
77940::$$$message_0723_0082_0000$$$::The old man's body shrinks.[lr]::
77941::$$$message_0723_0082_0001$$$::No, it just seems that way, because he backed up without making a sound.::
77942::$$$message_0723_0083_0000$$$::"In any case, Shinji has lost. We intend to withdraw early from the war this time...but you would still cut this old man down, Saber?"::
77943::$$$message_0723_0084_0000$$$::"I'd rather avoid needless fighting, if your words can be trusted.[lr]::
77944::$$$message_0723_0084_0001$$$::But there will be no next time if they are false. That goes for your progeny as well. If he fails to learn his lesson and comes for my Master again, I will slay him without mercy."::
77945::$$$message_0723_0085_0000$$$::"Hrm. Indeed."[lr]::
77946::$$$message_0723_0085_0001$$$::The old man disappears.[lr]::
77947::$$$message_0723_0085_0002$$$::...I wonder what kind of trick he used to do that.[lr]::
77948::$$$message_0723_0085_0003$$$::Zouken Matou melts back into the darkness, not unlike the way he first appeared before us.::
77949::$$$message_0723_0086_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77950::$$$message_0723_0086_0001$$$::All he leaves behind is the smell of rotting flesh.[lr]::
77951::$$$message_0723_0086_0002$$$::I pick up the fallen woman, fighting down the sense of disgust within my chest.::
77952::$$$message_0723_0087_0000$$$::"Let's go to the church, Saber. We can still make it. He'll know what to do."[lr]::
77953::$$$message_0723_0087_0001$$$::"Understood. I can carry the woman."[lr]::
77954::$$$message_0723_0087_0002$$$::"...Oh, uh, right. Thanks, Saber."::
77955::$$$message_0723_0088_0000$$$::Saber takes the woman and starts running.[lr]::
77956::$$$message_0723_0088_0001$$$::This situation calls for haste. Saber can take care of this. She's stronger than me, even if she's smaller. I shouldn't let my pride get in the way.::
77957::$$$message_0723_0089_0000$$$::"I'll lead the way. Follow me, and stay close."[lr]::
77958::$$$message_0723_0089_0001$$$::Saber races through the night.[lr]::
77959::$$$message_0723_0089_0002$$$::I run as fast as I can, trying not to get left behind.::
