72119::$$$message_0663_0000_0000$$$::Her field of view expands.[lr]::
72120::$$$message_0663_0000_0001$$$::As soon as she leaves the darkness, Rin Tohsaka forgets that she's underground.::
72121::$$$message_0663_0001_0000$$$::She sees an infinitely high canopy and a black sun.[lr]::
72122::$$$message_0663_0001_0001$$$::This massive space is no cave. It's a desolate land.[lr]::
72123::$$$message_0663_0001_0002$$$::It's easily two[line2]no, three kilometers in diameter.[lr]::
72124::$$$message_0663_0001_0003$$$::A giant monolith stands in the distance.[lr]::
72125::$$$message_0663_0001_0004$$$::...It is the beginning of this war, and the end.[lr]::
72126::$$$message_0663_0001_0005$$$::Once she climbs that precipice, she should see a giant crater.[lr]::
72127::$$$message_0663_0001_0006$$$::Therein lies a system that's been operating for two hundred years.::
72128::$$$message_0663_0002_0000$$$::A dark pillar burns inside the bowl of the huge rock containing the giant magic circle called the Greater Grail.::
72129::$$$message_0663_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]Thump, thump[font italic=false]. The black shadow pulsates.[lr]::
72130::$$$message_0663_0003_0001$$$::A wave of magical energy leaks out from [font italic=true]something[font italic=false] within, illuminating the wasteland.[lr]::
72131::$$$message_0663_0003_0002$$$::According to the Tohsaka archives, it's called the Altar of the Beginning.[lr]::
72132::$$$message_0663_0003_0003$$$::In its very center lies a circular cloister, a heart-world: [lr]::
72133::$$$message_0663_0003_0004$$$::the Cup of Heaven.[lr]::
72134::$$$message_0663_0003_0005$$$::Pregnant with immeasurable magical energy, it gives rise to an otherworld worthy of its name.::
72135::$$$message_0663_0004_0000$$$::"That's Aŋra Mainiiu... She wasn't kidding when she called it All the Evil in the World..."[lr]::
72136::$$$message_0663_0004_0001$$$::Rin makes a light remark as she walks toward the altar.[lr]::
72137::$$$message_0663_0004_0002$$$::...She's worried about Shirou and Rider, but her situation isn't much better.[lr]::
72138::$$$message_0663_0004_0003$$$::The magical energy filling the Greater Grail isn't in a dimension that humans can do anything about.::
72139::$$$message_0663_0005_0000$$$::It's an effectively [font italic=true]inexhaustible[font italic=false] vortex of magical energy,[lr]::
72140::$$$message_0663_0005_0001$$$::an inexhaustible resource that mages from around the world gather here to use.[lr]::
72141::$$$message_0663_0005_0002$$$::A human could never use it all up in their lifetime, and even if there was a limit to it, it's still correct to call it inexhaustible.::
72142::$$$message_0663_0006_0000$$$::"...I guess it is possible. That's definitely a Holy Grail that can grant any wish."[lr]::
72143::$$$message_0663_0006_0001$$$::She can feel her resolve starting to break under the premonition of death numbing her limbs, and the overwhelming disparity in combat strength.[lr]::
72144::$$$message_0663_0006_0002$$$::But Rin keeps walking, distracting herself with lighthearted quips.::
72145::$$$message_0663_0007_0000$$$::   At the moment, she's on her guard against Zouken Matou and Assassin.[lr]::
72146::$$$message_0663_0007_0001$$$::To Rin, Sakura Matou isn't an opponent she needs to be cautious of.[lr]::
72147::$$$message_0663_0007_0002$$$::She doesn't feel any threat from Sakura, who's lost sight of herself.[lr]::
72148::$$$message_0663_0007_0003$$$::In the end, Sakura is Zouken's puppet.[lr]::
72149::$$$message_0663_0007_0004$$$::Her greatest foe is Zouken, no doubt.[lr]::
72150::$$$message_0663_0007_0005$$$::Any face-off with Sakura will come once the rest of this affair is settled.::
72151::$$$message_0663_0008_0000$$$::"...That's weird. At this rate, I'm actually going to get to the altar."[lr]::
72152::$$$message_0663_0008_0001$$$::Zouken wouldn't have allowed an intruder to come this far.[lr]::
72153::$$$message_0663_0008_0002$$$::He would have attacked her well before she got this close.[lr]::
72154::$$$message_0663_0008_0003$$$::But he's nowhere to be seen, and Rin is almost at the altar.::
72155::$$$message_0663_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72156::$$$message_0663_0009_0001$$$::She thinks.[lr]::
72157::$$$message_0663_0009_0002$$$::She considers why Zouken hasn't stopped her, and the fact that she hasn't sensed him or Assassin at all.[lr]::
72158::$$$message_0663_0009_0003$$$::Rin takes her observations and makes a deduction.[lr]::
72159::$$$message_0663_0009_0004$$$::She wants to deny it, but her mind goes easily to that conclusion.[lr]::
72160::$$$message_0663_0009_0005$$$::No, she has no choice but to accept it.[lr]::
72161::$$$message_0663_0009_0006$$$::Because...::
72162::$$$message_0663_0010_0000$$$::"I'm so happy you're here, Nee-san. You didn't run away."::
72163::$$$message_0663_0011_0000$$$::Her deduction is now unmistakable fact.::
72164::$$$message_0663_0012_0000$$$::She looks up.[lr]::
72165::$$$message_0663_0012_0001$$$::On top of the high cliff, in front of a black sun,[lr]::
72166::$$$message_0663_0012_0002$$$::Sakura Matou welcomes her sister.::
72167::$$$message_0663_0013_0000$$$::"...Ngh."[lr]::
72168::$$$message_0663_0013_0001$$$::Rin takes a slight step back, overwhelmed by Sakura's sheer gravity.[lr]::
72169::$$$message_0663_0013_0002$$$::...Her transformation is more than anything Rin expected.[lr]::
72170::$$$message_0663_0013_0003$$$::Aŋra Mainiiu is a Servant with no definite form.[lr]::
72171::$$$message_0663_0013_0004$$$::It's nothing more than a shadow incarnated by human wishes, modeled after human fantasies.[lr]::
72172::$$$message_0663_0013_0005$$$::Thus, its power is granted to the host and Master who will give birth to it.::
72173::$$$message_0663_0014_0000$$$::At this very moment, Sakura Matou is Aŋra Mainiiu.[lr]::
72174::$$$message_0663_0014_0001$$$::She now serves the function of taking the curse of All the Evil in the World, giving it direction and spilling it into the world.::
72175::$$$message_0663_0015_0000$$$::"...Oh, crap. If Kirei was here, he'd probably call her an agent of God...."[lr]::
72176::$$$message_0663_0015_0001$$$::Looking up at Sakura who has become endless magical energy, Rin unseals the Jeweled Sword.[lr]::
72177::$$$message_0663_0015_0002$$$::   But is this something she can even fight?::
72178::$$$message_0663_0016_0000$$$::Weapons which support magecraft and Mystic Codes which support rituals are broadly divided into two categories.[lr]::
72179::$$$message_0663_0016_0001$$$::The first type are Amplifying Functions.[lr]::
72180::$$$message_0663_0016_0002$$$::These are backup fuel sources that amplify or replenish a mage's energy, or enhance their magecraft.[lr]::
72181::$$$message_0663_0016_0003$$$::They are treated as orthodox support Mystic Codes, and any mage owns at least one. Rin's jewels fall into this category.::
72182::$$$message_0663_0017_0000$$$::The second type are Limited Functions.[lr]::
72183::$$$message_0663_0017_0001$$$::Special magical implements, where the weapon is magecraft itself.[lr]::
72184::$$$message_0663_0017_0002$$$::They are powered by a mage's magical energy, and enact a pre-defined Mystic.[lr]::
72185::$$$message_0663_0017_0003$$$::Their greatest advantage is that a user can execute magecraft that they personally can't perform, as long as they have magical energy.::
72186::$$$message_0663_0018_0000$$$::Limited Functions may not be versatile and restricted to a single purpose, but they have accordingly powerful effects.[lr]::
72187::$$$message_0663_0018_0001$$$::For example, a spear which always pierces the heart,[lr]::
72188::$$$message_0663_0018_0002$$$::a bridle which can control a Divine Beast,[lr]::
72189::$$$message_0663_0018_0003$$$::or a dagger that cancels out all magical effects.[lr]::
72190::$$$message_0663_0018_0004$$$::Most Noble Phantasms are classified as Limited Functions.::
72191::$$$message_0663_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72192::$$$message_0663_0019_0001$$$::And which type does Rin's Jeweled Sword fall into?[lr]::
72193::$$$message_0663_0019_0002$$$::Is it an Amplifying Function which grants its user magical energy,[lr]::
72194::$$$message_0663_0019_0003$$$::or a Limited Function which defeats the enemy with a unique ability?[lr]::
72195::$$$message_0663_0019_0004$$$::Still...[lr]::
72196::$$$message_0663_0019_0005$$$::No matter what it is, she doesn't feel like it'll work against Sakura.::
72197::$$$message_0663_0020_0000$$$::There is an overwhelming disparity in power.[lr]::
72198::$$$message_0663_0020_0001$$$::Sakura could probably blow away any magecraft without even trying.::
72199::$$$message_0663_0021_0000$$$::"What's wrong, Nee-san? You look so scared... Hehe, don't tell me you're losing your nerve after coming all this way."[lr]::
72200::$$$message_0663_0021_0001$$$::"...Quite the mouth on you now. How about you? What's a crybaby like you going to do without your guardian by your side?"[lr]::
72201::$$$message_0663_0021_0002$$$::[font italic=true]"..."[font italic=false][lr]::
72202::$$$message_0663_0021_0003$$$::The air freezes.[lr]::
72203::$$$message_0663_0021_0004$$$::The lukewarm vitality that fills the cave becomes tinged with dark bloodlust.::
72204::$$$message_0663_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72205::$$$message_0663_0022_0001$$$::The dark girl bites her lip slightly and sighs.[lr]::
72206::$$$message_0663_0022_0002$$$::"Grandfather is gone now. He got in my way, so I crushed him and Assassin."[lr]::
72207::$$$message_0663_0022_0003$$$::She giggles and smiles elegantly.::
72208::$$$message_0663_0023_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
72209::$$$message_0663_0023_0001$$$::She didn't even need to ask.[lr]::
72210::$$$message_0663_0023_0002$$$::Sakura killed Zouken.[lr]::
72211::$$$message_0663_0023_0003$$$::Of course he wouldn't show up.[lr]::
72212::$$$message_0663_0023_0004$$$::In the very end, the old mage was eaten by his own pet dog.::
72213::$$$message_0663_0024_0000$$$::"I see. So you're free now. For better or worse, Zouken was the person controlling you.[lr]::
72214::$$$message_0663_0024_0001$$$::You broke your own chains, so you have nothing to be afraid of anymore."[lr]::
72215::$$$message_0663_0024_0002$$$::"No. I'm not finished yet, Nee-san.[lr]::
72216::$$$message_0663_0024_0003$$$::It isn't enough to get rid of Grandfather. I've gotten so strong and I can do anything now, but I'm still not free."::
72217::$$$message_0663_0025_0000$$$::"...You're so insignificant to me now, but you won't disappear from inside of me. You're always in there, mocking me.[lr]::
72218::$$$message_0663_0025_0001$$$::So I'll never be free as long as you're here."::
72219::$$$message_0663_0026_0000$$$::Her voice is light and singsong, yet heavy and sticky.[lr]::
72220::$$$message_0663_0026_0001$$$::The contradiction proves that she's insane.[lr]::
72221::$$$message_0663_0026_0002$$$::In fact, the bloodlust filling the cavern is madness tinged with arrogance and awe.::
72222::$$$message_0663_0027_0000$$$::"Oh, yeah? You seem to be in a pretty good mood despite everything. You killed Zouken, killed Assassin, and it sounds like you even killed Kirei.[lr]::
72223::$$$message_0663_0027_0001$$$::Very well done, considering how much you were against it before. Have you gotten used to murder yet?"::
72224::$$$message_0663_0028_0000$$$::"Yes. After all, crushing people isn't any different from swallowing them.[lr]::
72225::$$$message_0663_0028_0001$$$::Humans live such boring, pointless lives before I play with them. And I get thirsty, too.[lr]::
72226::$$$message_0663_0028_0002$$$::See? I'm just like you, Nee-san. I'm just doing what everyone else does."::
72227::$$$message_0663_0029_0000$$$::"Wait, do you seriously believe that sophistry?"[lr]::
72228::$$$message_0663_0029_0001$$$::"It isn't sophistry. I'm not wrong.[lr]::
72229::$$$message_0663_0029_0002$$$::The only thing that's changed is that I'm stronger now. I'm strong, so I live my life a different way."::
72230::$$$message_0663_0030_0000$$$::"I'm...I'm stronger now. I'm allowed to do anything now that I'm strong.[lr]::
72231::$$$message_0663_0030_0001$$$::...Yeah. As long as I'm strong and I don't lose to anyone, I'll be forgiven for everything I've done. If I'm not myself anymore, then I can say that it was all completely natural, that I had no choice...!"::
72232::$$$message_0663_0031_0000$$$::She screams in rage.[lr]::
72233::$$$message_0663_0031_0001$$$::It's the sobbing whine of a child who has nothing else to believe in.::
72234::$$$message_0663_0032_0000$$$::"Get it now, Nee-san? That's who I'll be. So I can kill anyone now. It's perfectly normal to me now."[lr]::
72235::$$$message_0663_0032_0001$$$::"...Okay. So you're going to take your anger out on anyone you see. But what about Shirou? He still thinks that he can save you. Are you going murder him, too?"::
72236::$$$message_0663_0033_0000$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
72237::$$$message_0663_0033_0001$$$::The girl's face twitches.[lr]::
72238::$$$message_0663_0033_0002$$$::Rin's question was the last barrier.[lr]::
72239::$$$message_0663_0033_0003$$$::...Her ecstasy begins to recede.[lr]::
72240::$$$message_0663_0033_0004$$$::Hearing that the boy is so near at hand, the girl manages to reel in her mind that she'd nearly let go of.::
72241::$$$message_0663_0034_0000$$$::Then, she smiles gently.[lr]::
72242::$$$message_0663_0034_0001$$$::"Yes. Senpai is no exception.[lr]::
72243::$$$message_0663_0034_0002$$$::Actually, he's the only person I really want to kill, Nee-san.[lr]::
72244::$$$message_0663_0034_0003$$$::Yeah... I..."::
72245::$$$message_0663_0035_0000$$$::                                   ...I want to hurry up and swallow Senpai.::
72246::$$$message_0663_0036_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
72247::$$$message_0663_0036_0001$$$::Sakura's answer is too late, in every sense of the word.[lr]::
72248::$$$message_0663_0036_0002$$$::Rin grips the Jeweled Sword, calculating the distance to the enemy above her.::
72249::$$$message_0663_0037_0000$$$::"...Hmph. What was all that you said about taking Aŋra Mainiiu down with you?[lr]::
72250::$$$message_0663_0037_0001$$$::I thought you were stupid, but not [font italic=true]this[font italic=false] stupid. You've completely let it take you over. [font italic=true]You've stopped being human[font italic=false]."[lr]::
72251::$$$message_0663_0037_0002$$$::The hostility is plain in Rin's voice.[lr]::
72252::$$$message_0663_0037_0003$$$::As the administrator of these lands, she has identified her sister as [font italic=true]evil[font italic=false].::
72253::$$$message_0663_0038_0000$$$::"...Heh. You're just playing tough. Be honest, Nee-san.[lr]::
72254::$$$message_0663_0038_0001$$$::You're actually jealous of my power, aren't you? You envy me. That's why you came to kill me even though you know you can't win.[lr]::
72255::$$$message_0663_0038_0002$$$::...Yeah. You want to take this child away from me to make yourself happy."::
72256::$$$message_0663_0039_0000$$$::A shadow rises.[lr]::
72257::$$$message_0663_0039_0001$$$::It's a cluster of magical energy unlike any before, a [font italic=true]power of Absorption[font italic=false] rivalling a Servant's Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
72258::$$$message_0663_0039_0002$$$::And not just one[line2]more rear up, one after another.::
72259::$$$message_0663_0040_0000$$$::"I won't let you have it. This is my power. All I'll give you is regret and despair.[lr]::
72260::$$$message_0663_0040_0001$$$::I'll teach you...nice and slow."[lr]::
72261::$$$message_0663_0040_0002$$$::Four shadows tower over them.[lr]::
72262::$$$message_0663_0040_0003$$$::They reach for the girl below, like giant protectors.::
72263::$$$message_0663_0041_0000$$$::"I'll show you the difference in our powers, Nee-san.[lr]::
72264::$$$message_0663_0041_0001$$$::No one's coming to save you this time. Drown in the Cup of Heaven, like a bug fallen into a lake."[lr]::
72265::$$$message_0663_0041_0002$$$::A shadow giant approaches.[lr]::
72266::$$$message_0663_0041_0003$$$::Rin Tohsaka is swallowed by a massive power that can't be dodged or blocked.::
