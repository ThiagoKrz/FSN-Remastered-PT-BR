64564::$$$message_0594_0000_0001$$$::My heart hurts.[lr]::
64565::$$$message_0594_0000_0002$$$::Blood runs down the fingers that are gripping the knife.::
64566::$$$message_0594_0001_0000$$$::"...Nngh!"[lr]::
64567::$$$message_0594_0001_0001$$$::I grind my teeth.[lr]::
64568::$$$message_0594_0001_0002$$$::I desperately try to stifle the sobs rising to my throat.::
64569::$$$message_0594_0002_0000$$$::"Kh...haah..."[lr]::
64570::$$$message_0594_0002_0001$$$::My eyelids feel hot.[lr]::
64571::$$$message_0594_0002_0002$$$::I can't bear to look down, so I raise my head and control my anger.::
64572::$$$message_0594_0003_0000$$$::...I lower the knife.[lr]::
64573::$$$message_0594_0003_0001$$$::No matter how hard I try, I can't manage something so simple.[lr]::
64574::$$$message_0594_0003_0002$$$::It pisses me off.[lr]::
64575::$$$message_0594_0003_0003$$$::Seriously, something's wrong with me.[lr]::
64576::$$$message_0594_0003_0004$$$::After everything I've done to come this far, I finally know my own heart.::
64577::$$$message_0594_0004_0000$$$::"...I'm a fool."[lr]::
64578::$$$message_0594_0004_0001$$$::...Yes.[lr]::
64579::$$$message_0594_0004_0002$$$::I came to an answer long ago.[lr]::
64580::$$$message_0594_0004_0003$$$::It was a choice I made with fatal conviction as I held Sakura that night in the rain.::
64581::$$$message_0594_0005_0000$$$::                                              "Will you betray it?"::
64582::$$$message_0594_0006_0000$$$::Something tells me to remember.[lr]::
64583::$$$message_0594_0006_0001$$$::Didn't you say that you would be a hero? That you'd do what's right?[lr]::
64584::$$$message_0594_0006_0002$$$::The competing thoughts are tearing my body apart.::
64585::$$$message_0594_0007_0000$$$::   A "hero" who will kill many people tonight for Sakura's sake.[lr]::
64586::$$$message_0594_0007_0001$$$::A "hero" who's always been selfish.::
64587::$$$message_0594_0008_0000$$$::   Kiritsugu, who cast off his own feelings for what he believed in.[lr]::
64588::$$$message_0594_0008_0001$$$::A powerless human who saves others only for his own satisfaction.::
64589::$$$message_0594_0009_0000$$$::The fire ten years ago.[lr]::
64590::$$$message_0594_0009_0001$$$::In exchange for being the only survivor, I've lived my life trying to prevent such a tragedy from ever happening again.::
64591::$$$message_0594_0010_0000$$$::All the time I've spent until now.[lr]::
64592::$$$message_0594_0010_0001$$$::My self, my feelings that I've believed in for the last ten years hammer my stopped self in the chest.[lr]::
64593::$$$message_0594_0010_0002$$$::I ask myself if I'm a traitor.[lr]::
64594::$$$message_0594_0010_0003$$$::Will I betray myself, who lived through the burning ruins, crying while everyone else died around me?::
64595::$$$message_0594_0011_0000$$$::   That atonement.[lr]::
64596::$$$message_0594_0011_0001$$$::Will I betray my past self, who clung to the belief that he couldn't live without making it up to the people who died?::
64597::$$$message_0594_0012_0000$$$::"Yeah."::
64598::$$$message_0594_0013_0000$$$::It can't be forgiven with an apology.[lr]::
64599::$$$message_0594_0013_0001$$$::It isn't a sin that one can gloss over.[lr]::
64600::$$$message_0594_0013_0002$$$::I'm abandoning my own self.[lr]::
64601::$$$message_0594_0013_0003$$$::Even if it means turning my life into a lie, and leaving everything I've believed in, everyone who's helped me.::
64602::$$$message_0594_0014_0000$$$::"...I'll betray them all."::
64603::$$$message_0594_0015_0000$$$::I've chosen what I want to protect.[lr]::
64604::$$$message_0594_0015_0001$$$::As long as Sakura is smiling after this, I'm fine with it.[lr]::
64605::$$$message_0594_0015_0002$$$::Even if I have to lie to myself to go on living.::
64606::$$$message_0594_0016_0000$$$::...These feelings aren't wrong.[lr]::
64607::$$$message_0594_0016_0001$$$::I need Sakura.[lr]::
64608::$$$message_0594_0016_0002$$$::Sakura needs me.[lr]::
64609::$$$message_0594_0016_0003$$$::    For the first time...[lr]::
64610::$$$message_0594_0016_0004$$$::I wish to protect a single life over many lives.::
64611::$$$message_0594_0017_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
64612::$$$message_0594_0017_0001$$$::I take a deep breath and relax my numb fingers.[lr]::
64613::$$$message_0594_0017_0002$$$::This is the last time I doubt myself.[lr]::
64614::$$$message_0594_0017_0003$$$::I'll leave the room before Sakura wakes up and put the knife back.::
64615::$$$message_0594_0018_0000$$$::   Just as I try to leave the room...[lr]::
64616::$$$message_0594_0018_0001$$$::"Senpai. Why didn't you kill me?"[lr]::
64617::$$$message_0594_0018_0002$$$::Sakura's voice comes from the dark.::
64618::$$$message_0594_0019_0000$$$::"Sakura..."[lr]::
64619::$$$message_0594_0019_0001$$$::She was awake?[lr]::
64620::$$$message_0594_0019_0002$$$::Sakura's shaking in bed, staring at the knife I'm holding.::
64621::$$$message_0594_0020_0000$$$::...Her eyes are clouded with pain.[lr]::
64622::$$$message_0594_0020_0001$$$::She looks like she's on the verge of tears, but not because I came here to kill her.[lr]::
64623::$$$message_0594_0020_0002$$$::It's as if she's apologizing for pushing me this far.::
64624::$$$message_0594_0021_0000$$$::"It's all right. Do what you want. I'm too afraid to do it myself, but I'm okay with it, if it's you."::
64625::$$$message_0594_0022_0000$$$::Does she really mean that?[lr]::
64626::$$$message_0594_0022_0001$$$::Her voice is pleading and tinged with obvious fear.[lr]::
64627::$$$message_0594_0022_0002$$$::Trembling slightly, she gazes earnestly at the knife that hovers over her head, as if staring her inevitable death in the face.[lr]::
64628::$$$message_0594_0022_0003$$$::To me...[lr]::
64629::$$$message_0594_0022_0004$$$::It looks like her utmost determination to keep herself from running away.::
64630::$$$message_0594_0023_0000$$$::"...Sakura."::
64631::$$$message_0594_0024_0000$$$::...What have I done?[lr]::
64632::$$$message_0594_0024_0001$$$::Was I so desperate that I didn't even notice it?[lr]::
64633::$$$message_0594_0024_0002$$$::The way she was trembling.[lr]::
64634::$$$message_0594_0024_0003$$$::How did I just realize now that she was determined to pretend to sleep and let me live!?::
64635::$$$message_0594_0025_0000$$$::"Sakura, I[line2]"[lr]::
64636::$$$message_0594_0025_0001$$$::"I know. You made the right choice, Senpai.[lr]::
64637::$$$message_0594_0025_0002$$$::After all, this is my fault.[lr]::
64638::$$$message_0594_0025_0003$$$::...I'm just saying this because it's the last time, but I don't know how long I can keep being myself.[lr]::
64639::$$$message_0594_0025_0004$$$::I can't tell anything anymore. How long a day is, what we talked about at lunch, when we had lunch, what happened yesterday or what will happen tomorrow..."::
64640::$$$message_0594_0026_0000$$$::"And that's not all. I keep having strange dreams. Scary, bloody dreams. But in them, there's a version of me who thinks they're fun. It's all so terrifying."::
64641::$$$message_0594_0027_0000$$$::"In the dreams, I'm a bad person. I'm laughing while taking so much from everyone else.[lr]::
64642::$$$message_0594_0027_0001$$$::...It scared me and I kept asking for help, but nobody helped me."::
64643::$$$message_0594_0028_0000$$$::"So I started to think they're all going to die anyway.[lr]::
64644::$$$message_0594_0028_0001$$$::That I won't save them, so it makes sense that they won't save me, either. I pretended that the dreams were only dreams."::
64645::$$$message_0594_0029_0000$$$::"...But I was wrong. I wanted these dreams.[lr]::
64646::$$$message_0594_0029_0001$$$::The real me is dirty, cowardly, and unfair.[lr]::
64647::$$$message_0594_0029_0002$$$::I don't like anyone. I only know how to resent people, and I'm wrong for enjoying those dreams, even for a second.[lr]::
64648::$$$message_0594_0029_0003$$$::The dreams aren't bad, but someone who has these dreams should never have existed."::
64649::$$$message_0594_0030_0000$$$::"Senpai, I'm slowly losing my mind.[lr]::
64650::$$$message_0594_0030_0001$$$::At this rate, I'm going to have these dreams all the time, and I won't remember who you are anymore. I'll turn into a bad person who goes around killing people in real life."::
64651::$$$message_0594_0031_0000$$$::"So...may I ask you a favor?[lr]::
64652::$$$message_0594_0031_0001$$$::...W-will you please end this before I become a worse version of myself? If you do..."[lr]::
64653::$$$message_0594_0031_0002$$$::Sakura tries to say that it'll save her.::
64654::$$$message_0594_0032_0000$$$::Before she can...[lr]::
64655::$$$message_0594_0032_0001$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
64656::$$$message_0594_0032_0002$$$::I cut her off with a hug. She's still trembling.::
64657::$$$message_0594_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64658::$$$message_0594_0033_0001$$$::I put more strength into my arms.[lr]::
64659::$$$message_0594_0033_0002$$$::...This is an embrace I couldn't complete before.[lr]::
64660::$$$message_0594_0033_0003$$$::I pull Sakura in close, when I could only bring myself to barely touch her before.[lr]::
64661::$$$message_0594_0033_0004$$$::I accept her body as hard as I can, my hands grasping her back fiercely.::
64662::$$$message_0594_0034_0000$$$::"...Senpai."[lr]::
64663::$$$message_0594_0034_0001$$$::...Sakura doesn't resist.[lr]::
64664::$$$message_0594_0034_0002$$$::Even though she's afraid of death, even though she doesn't want to die, even though she asked me to kill her, Sakura finally relaxes.[lr]::
64665::$$$message_0594_0034_0003$$$::"...You can't. I'm...sure you'll regret this."[lr]::
64666::$$$message_0594_0034_0004$$$::She whispers the same words from that night in a grateful voice.::
64667::$$$message_0594_0035_0000$$$::"...I'm already feeling regret.[lr]::
64668::$$$message_0594_0035_0001$$$::Not for what I'm going to do next. I've always regretted the fact that I couldn't protect you before."[lr]::
64669::$$$message_0594_0035_0002$$$::She gasps quietly.[lr]::
64670::$$$message_0594_0035_0003$$$::Sakura raises her arms.[lr]::
64671::$$$message_0594_0035_0004$$$::Her cool fingers trace my cheeks.::
64672::$$$message_0594_0036_0000$$$::"I'll protect you. I swear I will."[lr]::
64673::$$$message_0594_0036_0001$$$::I talk to her while she cries in my arms.[lr]::
64674::$$$message_0594_0036_0002$$$::...That's all we can do now.[lr]::
64675::$$$message_0594_0036_0003$$$::All we can do is forgive each other, over and over.::
64676::$$$message_0594_0037_0000$$$::That night, I swore to be Sakura's ally.[lr]::
64677::$$$message_0594_0037_0001$$$::I don't regret that.[lr]::
64678::$$$message_0594_0037_0002$$$::There's only one person I should apologize to.::
64679::$$$message_0594_0038_0000$$$::    Will you forgive me, Sakura?[lr]::
64680::$$$message_0594_0038_0001$$$::I tell her with my arms, not my voice.[lr]::
64681::$$$message_0594_0038_0002$$$::    Will you forgive me for betraying myself?[lr]::
64682::$$$message_0594_0038_0003$$$::Finally, I confess my sin.::
