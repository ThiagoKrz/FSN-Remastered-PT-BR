51758::$$$message_0446_0000_0000$$$::It's bedtime.[lr]::
51759::$$$message_0446_0000_0001$$$::I don't know what happened to Saber, but the lights have gone out in that room. The sound of activity from it has gone silent.[lr]::
51760::$$$message_0446_0000_0002$$$::I've heard it gets noisy when there's three girls together, and it seems that is true even when they're quiet like Saber and Sakura are.::
51761::$$$message_0446_0001_0000$$$::"...Wait, never mind. It was mainly Fuji-nee's laughter."[lr]::
51762::$$$message_0446_0001_0001$$$::Though it was still pretty noisy.[lr]::
51763::$$$message_0446_0001_0002$$$::It isn't good for my mental health to have girls the same age as me being rowdy under the same roof.::
51764::$$$message_0446_0002_0000$$$::"...Damn it. My sleepiness went away thinking about them."[lr]::
51765::$$$message_0446_0002_0001$$$::Like Saber's troubled expression,[lr]::
51766::$$$message_0446_0002_0002$$$::if Sakura and Saber are getting along,[lr]::
51767::$$$message_0446_0002_0003$$$::or what Fuji-nee is even thinking.::
51768::$$$message_0446_0003_0000$$$::The more that I think, the more my head starts hurting. If it's like this, it might've been better if Saber slept in the room next to mine. ::
51769::$$$message_0446_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51770::$$$message_0446_0004_0001$$$::It's 11 PM.[lr]::
51771::$$$message_0446_0004_0002$$$::The lights are out in the house, and there's not a single sound outside.[lr]::
51772::$$$message_0446_0004_0003$$$::My hand goes to the door to slide it open and tiptoe by so Fuji-nee doesn't hear anything.::
51773::$$$message_0446_0005_0000$$$::I go out to the garden.[lr]::
51774::$$$message_0446_0005_0001$$$::The moon is shining bright, while the cutting breeze is cold.[lr]::
51775::$$$message_0446_0005_0002$$$::In the winter night, the world was silent, as if frozen.::
51776::$$$message_0446_0006_0000$$$::The shed has gone still.[lr]::
51777::$$$message_0446_0006_0001$$$::The place where I got cornered by Lancer yesterday,[lr]::
51778::$$$message_0446_0006_0002$$$::and the place where Saber appeared.[lr]::
51779::$$$message_0446_0006_0003$$$::The entrance is still open, and the darkness inside feels uninviting.::
51780::$$$message_0446_0007_0000$$$::I go inside.[lr]::
51781::$$$message_0446_0007_0001$$$::Closing the door behind me to shut out the cold air, I turn on an old stove heater.::
51782::$$$message_0446_0008_0000$$$::"...Shoot over 200 arrows, huh?"[lr]::
51783::$$$message_0446_0008_0001$$$::The teaching of archery focuses on accuracy, piercing strength, and persistence.[lr]::
51784::$$$message_0446_0008_0002$$$::Accuracy is how well one can hit the target.[lr]::
51785::$$$message_0446_0008_0003$$$::Piercing strength is the power to pierce the target.[lr]::
51786::$$$message_0446_0008_0004$$$::And lastly, persistence is how long one can maintain the accuracy and piercing strength.::
51787::$$$message_0446_0009_0000$$$::...I think I read it somewhere in an archery manual.[lr]::
51788::$$$message_0446_0009_0001$$$::Once one aims to be a shooter, after they learn the true meaning of kyudo, they continue that forever.[lr]::
51789::$$$message_0446_0009_0002$$$::So they say to shoot over 200 arrows... Or something.::
51790::$$$message_0446_0010_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I don't know what I should do as a Master, so I should at least train my magecraft."[lr]::
51791::$$$message_0446_0010_0001$$$::I sit down inside the shed and take a deep breath.::
51792::$$$message_0446_0011_0000$$$::"Haah... Haah..."[lr]::
51793::$$$message_0446_0011_0001$$$::...I control my breathing and begin my regular training.[lr]::
51794::$$$message_0446_0011_0002$$$::My mind imagines the same thing that it always does.[lr]::
51795::$$$message_0446_0011_0003$$$::An image of a sword that comes to mind.::
51796::$$$message_0446_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51797::$$$message_0446_0012_0001$$$::I ignore that and clear my mind even more.[lr]::
51798::$$$message_0446_0012_0002$$$::Once I've let magical energy flow throughout my entire body, I practice Strengthening like usual.[lr]::
51799::$$$message_0446_0012_0003$$$::When I was attacked by Lancer last night, I succeeded in Strengthening for the first time in a few years.[lr]::
51800::$$$message_0446_0012_0004$$$::I need to repeat it so that I don't forget the sensation, or else it would be a waste.::
51801::$$$message_0446_0013_0000$$$::"...Trace, on."[lr]::
51802::$$$message_0446_0013_0001$$$::I narrow my eyes and breathe out deeply.::
51803::$$$message_0446_0014_0000$$$::    That's all for now.[lr]::
51804::$$$message_0446_0014_0001$$$::I forget all about the Holy Grail War, Saber, and Tohsaka once I immerse myself into the process.[lr]::
51805::$$$message_0446_0014_0002$$$::Clearing all thoughts and hesitation from my mind, I immerse myself into the familiar training.::
