62081::$$$message_0571_0000_0000$$$::"Stop it![lr]::
62082::$$$message_0571_0000_0001$$$::I'm begging you, don't do this here!"[lr]::
62083::$$$message_0571_0000_0002$$$::Sakura's sobbing voice brings me back to my senses.::
62084::$$$message_0571_0001_0000$$$::"Sakura..."[lr]::
62085::$$$message_0571_0001_0001$$$::"Well, this is a surprise. I think this is the first time you've ever talked back to me."[lr]::
62086::$$$message_0571_0001_0002$$$::Shinji's voice is filled with an amusement I've never heard from him before.[lr]::
62087::$$$message_0571_0001_0003$$$::Sakura stares at the ground, slightly trembling.::
62088::$$$message_0571_0002_0000$$$::"So what do you want to do, Sakura? Will you stay here or come home to the Matous? I'm a nice brother, so I'll respect your opinion."[lr]::
62089::$$$message_0571_0002_0001$$$::"...I'll do what you say, so please don't do this in front of Senpai. I'll come home, I promise."::
62090::$$$message_0571_0003_0000$$$::"You'll do what I say?"[lr]::
62091::$$$message_0571_0003_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
62092::$$$message_0571_0003_0002$$$::Sakura nods wordlessly.::
62093::$$$message_0571_0004_0000$$$::"Okay. Then I won't take you home. I'm a generous big brother, after all. I have to let you do what you want. Isn't that right, Emiya?"[lr]::
62094::$$$message_0571_0004_0001$$$::"Shinji..."::
62095::$$$message_0571_0005_0000$$$::"Haha. Why are you so mad? It was just a joke, man. I was giving you a hard time. People are gonna think you're some loser if you always hold a grudge."[lr]::
62096::$$$message_0571_0005_0001$$$::Shinji returns to the door.::
62097::$$$message_0571_0006_0000$$$::"Later, Emiya. Take care of Sakura.[lr]::
62098::$$$message_0571_0006_0001$$$::...But Sakura, you can come home anytime you want."[lr]::
62099::$$$message_0571_0006_0002$$$::He leaves with a wave.[lr]::
62100::$$$message_0571_0006_0003$$$::Shinji departs the Emiya house without Sakura.::
62101::$$$message_0571_0007_0000$$$::I resume making dinner.[lr]::
62102::$$$message_0571_0007_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
62103::$$$message_0571_0007_0002$$$::I don't know what to talk about, so I just cut tomatoes and pumpkin.[lr]::
62104::$$$message_0571_0007_0003$$$::The only sound in the kitchen is the chop-chop of knife on cutting board. This is awkward.::
62105::$$$message_0571_0008_0000$$$::"Senpai, the rice is cooked. Ms. Fujimura isn't here yet, but should I start serving?"[lr]::
62106::$$$message_0571_0008_0001$$$::"Uh...yeah. It's a little early, but let's do that."[lr]::
62107::$$$message_0571_0008_0002$$$::"Okay. I'll get ready."::
62108::$$$message_0571_0009_0000$$$::Sakura moves briskly, helping me as if the earlier confrontation never happened.::
62109::$$$message_0571_0010_0000$$$::...But it's obvious she's forcing herself to act that way.[lr]::
62110::$$$message_0571_0010_0001$$$::Sakura's acting calm because she doesn't want me to worry.::
62111::$$$message_0571_0011_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
62112::$$$message_0571_0011_0001$$$::If that's Sakura's choice, then I can only play along.[lr]::
62113::$$$message_0571_0011_0002$$$::She's the one who's most troubled right now.[lr]::
62114::$$$message_0571_0011_0003$$$::Even if it's a forced smile, I should still give her a smile of my own...huh?::
62115::$$$message_0571_0012_0000$$$::"Sakura?"[lr]::
62116::$$$message_0571_0012_0001$$$::I hear the sound of a bowl dropping, and turn.[lr]::
62117::$$$message_0571_0012_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62118::$$$message_0571_0012_0003$$$::A shattered rice bowl is at Sakura's feet.::
62119::$$$message_0571_0013_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62120::$$$message_0571_0013_0001$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
62121::$$$message_0571_0013_0002$$$::She suddenly collapses.[lr]::
62122::$$$message_0571_0013_0003$$$::The strength goes out of her legs, and she falls to her knees then backwards.::
62123::$$$message_0571_0014_0000$$$::"Sakura!"[lr]::
62124::$$$message_0571_0014_0001$$$::I rush over and support her.[lr]::
62125::$$$message_0571_0014_0002$$$::"A fever!?"[lr]::
62126::$$$message_0571_0014_0003$$$::It's bad.[lr]::
62127::$$$message_0571_0014_0004$$$::I can feel Sakura's fever even through her uniform.::
62128::$$$message_0571_0015_0000$$$::"Sakura... Hey, get it together!"[lr]::
62129::$$$message_0571_0015_0001$$$::"Eh...? Sen...pai? What's...wrong...?"::
62130::$$$message_0571_0016_0000$$$::Her voice is listless.[lr]::
62131::$$$message_0571_0016_0001$$$::Even though she's on the verge of passing out, I can tell that she's doing her best to form words.::
62132::$$$message_0571_0017_0000$$$::"You still haven't gotten over your cold, obviously!"[lr]::
62133::$$$message_0571_0017_0001$$$::"Ah...no, but...I'm still okay..."[lr]::
62134::$$$message_0571_0017_0002$$$::"You idiot! People don't pass out when they're 'okay'!"::
62135::$$$message_0571_0018_0000$$$::   Damn it, I'm such a fool.[lr]::
62136::$$$message_0571_0018_0001$$$::How could I have let Sakura work hard all day when I knew she's still sick?[lr]::
62137::$$$message_0571_0018_0002$$$::Throw in what happened earlier on top of that, and it's no surprise she'd faint from the mental and physical stress!::
62138::$$$message_0571_0019_0000$$$::"More importantly, I'm sorry for breaking the bowl.[lr]::
62139::$$$message_0571_0019_0001$$$::I'll clean it up[line2]ahh!?"[lr]::
62140::$$$message_0571_0019_0002$$$::I scoop Sakura up in my arms.::
62141::$$$message_0571_0020_0000$$$::"S-Senpai!?"[lr]::
62142::$$$message_0571_0020_0001$$$::"Dinner can wait. I'm going to tuck you into bed. I'll take any complaints once you get better."::
62143::$$$message_0571_0021_0000$$$::I walk to the guesthouse carrying Sakura in my arms.[lr]::
62144::$$$message_0571_0021_0001$$$::I ignore anything she tries to say along the way.[lr]::
62145::$$$message_0571_0021_0002$$$::To be honest, I'm in such an intense mood that her words barely register, anyway.::
62146::$$$message_0571_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62147::$$$message_0571_0022_0001$$$::After a while, Sakura takes the hint and stops protesting by the time we get to the guestroom.[lr]::
62148::$$$message_0571_0022_0002$$$::She looks somber and does what I ask.[lr]::
62149::$$$message_0571_0022_0003$$$::The fever appears to have worsened, though the rest of her body doesn't feel any warmer.::
62150::$$$message_0571_0023_0000$$$::I leave the guestroom.[lr]::
62151::$$$message_0571_0023_0001$$$::Time to change the dinner menu.[lr]::
62152::$$$message_0571_0023_0002$$$::I need to hurry and make okayu and something to accompany it.::
62153::$$$message_0571_0024_0000$$$::It's almost 10:00 PM.[lr]::
62154::$$$message_0571_0024_0001$$$::Dinner is over, and it's time to get ready to go out on patrol.::
62155::$$$message_0571_0025_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
62156::$$$message_0571_0025_0001$$$::Sakura is sleeping in her bedroom.[lr]::
62157::$$$message_0571_0025_0002$$$::I ate dinner with Saber.[lr]::
62158::$$$message_0571_0025_0003$$$::Fuji-nee didn't come over. Maybe she's busy.::
62159::$$$message_0571_0026_0000$$$::"Shirou. It is about time."[lr]::
62160::$$$message_0571_0026_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
62161::$$$message_0571_0026_0002$$$::Saber wants to head out.[lr]::
62162::$$$message_0571_0026_0003$$$::Tonight, we'll...[lr]::
