17067::$$$message_0156_0000_0001$$$::"Is it early? It is almost noon, and by the time you have completed preparations, it will be lunchtime."::
17068::$$$message_0156_0001_0000$$$::"Hm? Well, I actually made us boxed lunches today.[lr]::
17069::$$$message_0156_0001_0001$$$::Everything's done and packed, so we just need to bring the bento from the living room and we can eat now."::
17070::$$$message_0156_0002_0000$$$::"Wonderful. Then I think I can manage to hold out."[lr]::
17071::$$$message_0156_0002_0001$$$::Saber breathes a sigh of relief.::
17072::$$$message_0156_0003_0000$$$::"Huh? What do you mean, hold out?"[lr]::
17073::$$$message_0156_0003_0001$$$::"N-nothing! Nothing at all! I am simply talking to myself! Let us eat!"::
17074::$$$message_0156_0004_0000$$$::"Saber, you've been pretty weird today. You were even sparring weird. If you're not feeling well, you need to tell me.[lr]::
17075::$$$message_0156_0004_0001$$$::If you're not feeling well, you shouldn't eat the bento. I'll make you something a little easier to digest."::
17076::$$$message_0156_0005_0000$$$::"Eh? N-no, that is absolutely not the case![lr]::
17077::$$$message_0156_0005_0001$$$::If you start now, it will take time, and we must eat right now... So let us eat! Now, Shirou!"::

17079::$$$message_0156_0006_0001$$$::[font italic=true]What's gotten into her?[font italic=false][lr]::
17080::$$$message_0156_0006_0002$$$::She doesn't look ill, and it doesn't look like I'll need to make her anything special.::
17081::$$$message_0156_0007_0000$$$::"Got it. Then I'll bring over the bento and some tea, so you two just wait here. We don't often have bento for lunch, so let's take the chance to eat here in the dojo."[lr]::
17082::$$$message_0156_0007_0001$$$::"Yes. Thank you, Shirou."::
17083::$$$message_0156_0008_0000$$$::Saber waves enthusiastically, sending me off.[lr]::
17084::$$$message_0156_0008_0001$$$::She's flustered, she's mad... Seriously, what's going on with her today?::
