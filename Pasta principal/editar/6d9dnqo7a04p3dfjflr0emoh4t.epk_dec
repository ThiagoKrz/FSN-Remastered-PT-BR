18752::$$$message_0178_0000_0000$$$::I should return the sheath to its rightful owner.[lr]::
18753::$$$message_0178_0000_0001$$$::I don't know if it'll work, but I have to try.[lr]::
18754::$$$message_0178_0000_0002$$$::But Saber did manage to put her hand into my body to check whether the sheath was there.[lr]::
18755::$$$message_0178_0000_0003$$$::So it's probably not impossible to extract.::
18756::$$$message_0178_0001_0000$$$::"What? Do you know what you are saying, Shirou?"[lr]::
18757::$$$message_0178_0001_0001$$$::"I do. The sheath was yours to begin with, so returning it to you just makes sense. Plus, with that, you might have a better chance of beating [font italic=true]him[font italic=false]."::
18758::$$$message_0178_0002_0000$$$::"That may be true. Once the sheath is returned to me, the magical energy at my disposal will increase.[lr]::
18759::$$$message_0178_0002_0001$$$::But that does not guarantee I will win against Gilgamesh. And once it is extracted, what will you do, Shirou?[lr]::
18760::$$$message_0178_0002_0002$$$::Without the sheath, you will no longer..."::
18761::$$$message_0178_0003_0000$$$::I'll no longer heal so rapidly from whatever injury I might sustain.[lr]::
18762::$$$message_0178_0003_0001$$$::But that's normal.[lr]::
18763::$$$message_0178_0003_0002$$$::I've relied on this regeneration too much.[lr]::
18764::$$$message_0178_0003_0003$$$::Nobody should be immortal.[lr]::
18765::$$$message_0178_0003_0004$$$::I shouldn't keep it anymore.::
18766::$$$message_0178_0004_0000$$$::"Take the sheath, Saber. This is absolutely what we need to win."[lr]::
18767::$$$message_0178_0004_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
18768::$$$message_0178_0005_0000$$$::Saber bites her lip, not answering.[lr]::
18769::$$$message_0178_0005_0001$$$::I'm not sure how long this moment stretches out between us.[lr]::
18770::$$$message_0178_0005_0002$$$::The clouds in the sky drift by, and as the moonlight starts to shine through the window...[lr]::
18771::$$$message_0178_0005_0003$$$::"Understood, Master. I must enter your heart for a moment, then."[lr]::
18772::$$$message_0178_0005_0004$$$::Saber nods...her hesitation gone.::
18773::$$$message_0178_0006_0000$$$::"I shall begin. Are you ready, Shirou?"[lr]::
18774::$$$message_0178_0006_0001$$$::"Yeah. Don't hesitate. Just go ahead."[lr]::
18775::$$$message_0178_0006_0002$$$::Saber begins.[lr]::
18776::$$$message_0178_0006_0003$$$::Her hand presses against my chest...[lr]::
18777::$$$message_0178_0006_0004$$$::"Hnnngh."[lr]::
18778::$$$message_0178_0006_0005$$$::...and sinks in.::
18779::$$$message_0178_0007_0000$$$::My job here is simple.[lr]::
18780::$$$message_0178_0007_0001$$$::The process of extracting the sheath is similar to Projection.[lr]::
18781::$$$message_0178_0007_0002$$$::The sacred sword's sheath has integrated itself throughout my body.[lr]::
18782::$$$message_0178_0007_0003$$$::I just have to collect all the dispersed bits of it and reform them into the sheath.::
18783::$$$message_0178_0008_0000$$$::This is all just my impression of what's going on though.[lr]::
18784::$$$message_0178_0008_0001$$$::I may say I'm reforming it into the sheath, but I'm just gathering the waves of magical energy.::
18785::$$$message_0178_0009_0000$$$::Saber is the one who will give it shape.[lr]::
18786::$$$message_0178_0009_0001$$$::She, the original owner, forms the shapeless bundle of magical energy into the sheath itself.[lr]::
18787::$$$message_0178_0009_0002$$$::I'm just helping her.[lr]::
18788::$$$message_0178_0009_0003$$$::It's like...making something from nothing.[lr]::
18789::$$$message_0178_0009_0004$$$::The scattered pieces of the sacred sword's sheath are reproduced with precision and painstaking care...without a single error.::
18790::$$$message_0178_0010_0000$$$::"Hngh!"[lr]::
18791::$$$message_0178_0010_0001$$$::My body grows hot.[lr]::
18792::$$$message_0178_0010_0002$$$::Projection is way beyond my means.[lr]::
18793::$$$message_0178_0010_0003$$$::It eats away at my body every time I use it.[lr]::
18794::$$$message_0178_0010_0004$$$::It destroys my nerves, burns my skin, and even has the power to cripple my brain.[lr]::
18795::$$$message_0178_0010_0005$$$::But it's the only weapon I have, and it could be the one thing that might help Saber.::
18796::$$$message_0178_0011_0000$$$::I imagine...[lr]::
18797::$$$message_0178_0011_0001$$$::I think back to when I saw her in my dreams.::
18798::$$$message_0178_0012_0000$$$::The golden sheath, fit for the King of Knights to carry into battle.[lr]::
18799::$$$message_0178_0012_0001$$$::The legendary sheath that protected its owner and led her to so many victories...I reproduce it vividly, without deviation, and as beautiful as it ever was.::
18800::$$$message_0178_0013_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
18801::$$$message_0178_0013_0001$$$::No matter the end awaiting us, I won't ever forget this. I will engrave the image in my mind.::
18802::$$$message_0178_0014_0000$$$::"Hngh!"[lr]::
18803::$$$message_0178_0014_0001$$$::I hear Saber's voice.[lr]::
18804::$$$message_0178_0014_0002$$$::I feel something that was within me for the longest time escape from my body.::
18805::$$$message_0178_0015_0000$$$::"This is amazing...this is truly incredible, Shirou! Nobody but you would have been able to reproduce this so perfectly!"[lr]::
18806::$$$message_0178_0015_0001$$$::It must have come out great, as Saber is so elated it surprises me.::
18807::$$$message_0178_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18808::$$$message_0178_0016_0001$$$::My body is still so searing hot that I just topple face-first onto the ground.::
18809::$$$message_0178_0017_0000$$$::"Ah, Shirou! You are drenched! I will bring you something to wipe you off right away!"[lr]::
18810::$$$message_0178_0017_0001$$$::Saber hurries back toward the house.[lr]::
18811::$$$message_0178_0017_0002$$$::As I listen to her footsteps, I take a deep breath.[lr]::
18812::$$$message_0178_0017_0003$$$::I think that turned out great.[lr]::
18813::$$$message_0178_0017_0004$$$::It was perfect.[lr]::
18814::$$$message_0178_0017_0005$$$::I don't think anything else I Project will ever turn out so perfect.::
18815::$$$message_0178_0018_0000$$$::"See ya. Thanks for everything."[lr]::
18816::$$$message_0178_0018_0001$$$::I bid farewell to the thing that had been a part of me for so long.[lr]::
18817::$$$message_0178_0018_0002$$$::The golden sheath that protected her...[lr]::
18818::$$$message_0178_0018_0003$$$::I will never, ever forget it.[lr]::
18819::$$$message_0178_0018_0004$$$::Though it's left my body, its form has been forever engraved into my heart.::
