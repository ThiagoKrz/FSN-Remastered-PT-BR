76220::$$$message_0705_0000_0000$$$::"That settles it then. I'm coming in. Come on, Shirou, take me to a guestroom. I saw a separate guesthouse on the way here. Oh, where do you want to sleep, Illya?"[lr]::

76231::$$$message_0705_0004_0000$$$::"Huh? Sakura's room is in the separate guesthouse."[lr]::
76232::$$$message_0705_0004_0001$$$::"Okay. Then Rin can stay there. I'll sleep anywhere besides the guesthouse."[lr]::
76233::$$$message_0705_0004_0002$$$::"Is that so? You can have the tatami room, then."[lr]::
76234::$$$message_0705_0004_0003$$$::Tohsaka and Illya casually banter. They seem close enough to be on a first-name basis now.::
