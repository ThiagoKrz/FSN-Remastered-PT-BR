18124::$$$message_0169_0000_0001$$$::I turn from the dark stairway that leads underground.[lr]::
18125::$$$message_0169_0000_0002$$$::As my heart hammers in my chest, I run.::
18126::$$$message_0169_0001_0000$$$::I can't stay another second.[lr]::
18127::$$$message_0169_0001_0001$$$::I need to get out of this building [font italic=true]right now[font italic=false].[lr]::
18128::$$$message_0169_0001_0002$$$::This is a bad place.[lr]::
18129::$$$message_0169_0001_0003$$$::It's always been like this.[lr]::
18130::$$$message_0169_0001_0004$$$::This church is not somewhere I should ever have come.[lr]::
18131::$$$message_0169_0001_0005$$$::I shouldn't have ever come into this building or met the priest.::
18132::$$$message_0169_0002_0000$$$::I return to the chapel.[lr]::
18133::$$$message_0169_0002_0001$$$::The empty house of God is deathly ominous.[lr]::
18134::$$$message_0169_0002_0002$$$::"Ha...haaah...hah...ha!"[lr]::
18135::$$$message_0169_0002_0003$$$::I keep running, only briefly glancing back.[lr]::
18136::$$$message_0169_0002_0004$$$::I'm almost at the exit.[lr]::
18137::$$$message_0169_0002_0005$$$::[font italic=true]There's nobody behind me.[font italic=false][lr]::
18138::$$$message_0169_0002_0006$$$::[font italic=true]There's nobody behind me.[font italic=false][lr]::
18139::$$$message_0169_0002_0007$$$::[font italic=true]There's nobody behind me.[font italic=false]::
18140::$$$message_0169_0003_0000$$$::I leave the church.[lr]::
18141::$$$message_0169_0003_0001$$$::I run through the square without looking back.[lr]::
18142::$$$message_0169_0003_0002$$$::What am I afraid of? What am I running from?[lr]::
18143::$$$message_0169_0003_0003$$$::I can't seem to shake off the sense of unease clinging to me.::
18144::$$$message_0169_0004_0000$$$::"Shirou! Where have you been, all alone!?"[lr]::
18145::$$$message_0169_0004_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18146::$$$message_0169_0004_0002$$$::The moment I come home, I get a different sort of scare.[lr]::
18147::$$$message_0169_0004_0003$$$::Saber is at the entrance, looking absolutely livid.::
18148::$$$message_0169_0005_0000$$$::"Oh...yeah. I'm home, Saber."[lr]::
18149::$$$message_0169_0005_0001$$$::"Do not, 'I am home,' me! How many times must I tell you not to leave on your own!?"::
18150::$$$message_0169_0006_0000$$$::"Uh...okay. You're right. Sorry. I'll be more careful next time."[lr]::
18151::$$$message_0169_0006_0001$$$::"There will not be a next time! I am furious with you! Shirou, explain why you went out alone![lr]::
18152::$$$message_0169_0006_0002$$$::Your wounds have not completely healed and we do not know when Gilgamesh will attack next. Just how much do you plan to make me worry about you!?"::
18153::$$$message_0169_0007_0000$$$::Saber [font italic=true]glares[font italic=false] at me.[lr]::
18154::$$$message_0169_0007_0001$$$::But I don't know what it is...::
18155::$$$message_0169_0008_0000$$$::"Um...I went to the church. I thought maybe I could learn Gilgamesh's weakness from the priest there."[lr]::
18156::$$$message_0169_0008_0001$$$::"Ah...the church? But why now?"::
18157::$$$message_0169_0009_0000$$$::"I've talked to him before. He's the overseer, so I thought he might be able to do something about the Servant from the last war.[lr]::
18158::$$$message_0169_0009_0001$$$::But it was futile. I failed.[lr]::
18159::$$$message_0169_0009_0002$$$::And I don't blame you for getting mad. I have you, Saber, and we should've gone to the church together."::
18160::$$$message_0169_0010_0000$$$::I bow my head to apologize again.[lr]::
18161::$$$message_0169_0010_0001$$$::"Erm...uh...well...as long as you understand..."[lr]::
18162::$$$message_0169_0010_0002$$$::Saber's threatening posture eases all at once.::
18163::$$$message_0169_0011_0000$$$::It's always been like that.[lr]::
18164::$$$message_0169_0011_0001$$$::Saber always gets really, really angry at how stupid I can be, but at the same time she's kind enough to forgive me right away.[lr]::
18165::$$$message_0169_0011_0002$$$::Or, if I'm being egotistical, it's like her resentment at being left home alone vanishes as soon as I get back.::
18166::$$$message_0169_0012_0000$$$::"W-well. If you are contrite for your actions, I suppose I should overlook this matter. And I was, perhaps, being slightly immature myself."::
18167::$$$message_0169_0013_0000$$$::"I don't think so. You were waiting for me, right? Honestly, I'm grateful. The moment you yelled at me, all my worries disappeared."::
18168::$$$message_0169_0014_0000$$$::"Huh? You are glad I yelled at you?"[lr]::
18169::$$$message_0169_0014_0001$$$::"Yeah. I'm so glad I came home to you, Saber."[lr]::
18170::$$$message_0169_0014_0002$$$::"...What?"::
18171::$$$message_0169_0015_0000$$$::Yeah, I'm glad to be home.[lr]::
18172::$$$message_0169_0015_0001$$$::I get to see Saber's face again.[lr]::
18173::$$$message_0169_0015_0002$$$::If I'd gone down into that basement, I don't think I'd have ever made it home.[lr]::
18174::$$$message_0169_0015_0003$$$::I'm sure I made the right choice now.::
18175::$$$message_0169_0016_0000$$$::"Shirou. How about we team up with Lancer?"[lr]::
18176::$$$message_0169_0016_0001$$$::"Eh? What was that, Saber?"[lr]::
18177::$$$message_0169_0016_0002$$$::It's past two in the afternoon, and we're having a late lunch when Saber broaches the topic.::
18178::$$$message_0169_0017_0000$$$::"As I said, we should team up with Lancer. Gilgamesh is entirely outside the Holy Grail War's rules. I am sure Lancer sees him as an opponent that cannot be ignored, and so he should be willing to cooperate with us if the conditions are right."::
18179::$$$message_0169_0018_0000$$$::"Hmmm. So the enemy of our enemy is our friend?"[lr]::
18180::$$$message_0169_0018_0001$$$::"Yes. If there is some benefit to him, he will surely be willing to work with us, even temporarily."::
18181::$$$message_0169_0019_0000$$$::Teaming up with Lancer, huh?[lr]::
18182::$$$message_0169_0019_0001$$$::That may be our only choice.[lr]::
18183::$$$message_0169_0019_0002$$$::We are no match for Gilgamesh on our own.[lr]::
18184::$$$message_0169_0019_0003$$$::But if Saber and Lancer can cooperate, we should be able to come up with at least a couple of schemes.::
18185::$$$message_0169_0020_0000$$$::"You're right. I don't know if Lancer will cooperate, but it wouldn't hurt to at least try to talk to him about it.[lr]::
18186::$$$message_0169_0020_0001$$$::Which would mean our problem is..."[lr]::
18187::$$$message_0169_0020_0002$$$::"Yes. The matter of how we get in contact with Lancer.[lr]::
18188::$$$message_0169_0020_0003$$$::We have not seen Lancer since that night, and we still do not know who his Master is. With only two Masters left, I do not imagine they will continue to sit by so passively."::
18189::$$$message_0169_0021_0000$$$::"Yeah. But Lancer not showing himself could mean he's afraid to face you alone."[lr]::
18190::$$$message_0169_0021_0001$$$::"Unlikely. Lancer is a worthy hero. He would be happy to fight me; he certainly would not be afraid.[lr]::
18191::$$$message_0169_0021_0002$$$::That he has not appeared after all this time means he must have a reason for his behavior."::
18192::$$$message_0169_0022_0000$$$::We fold our arms, thinking.[lr]::
18193::$$$message_0169_0022_0001$$$::"My, the two of you are sure in sync this morning."[lr]::
18194::$$$message_0169_0022_0002$$$::"T-Tohsaka!?"[lr]::
18195::$$$message_0169_0022_0003$$$::"Rin...how long have you been there!?"[lr]::
18196::$$$message_0169_0022_0004$$$::The two of us jump simultaneously.::
18197::$$$message_0169_0023_0000$$$::"A while now.[lr]::
18198::$$$message_0169_0023_0001$$$::The two of you are completely focused on each other. It was just so silly, I had to keep quiet and watch.[lr]::
18199::$$$message_0169_0023_0002$$$::Don't you think that was the best move? You were having a moment, so I figured I shouldn't butt in."::
18200::$$$message_0169_0024_0000$$$::"Wha...!? R-Rin, Shirou and I are Master and Servant, so there is nothing of the sort[line2]"::
18201::$$$message_0169_0025_0000$$$::"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll just leave it at that.[lr]::
18202::$$$message_0169_0025_0001$$$::So returning to what you two were talking about...I agree that you should try teaming up with Lancer. If Goldy really is the King of Heroes, I don't think you have much of a chance of winning unless you form an alliance."::
18203::$$$message_0169_0026_0000$$$::Oh man...[lr]::
18204::$$$message_0169_0026_0001$$$::I don't know how much she heard, but Tohsaka is at least aware of the current situation.[lr]::
18205::$$$message_0169_0026_0002$$$::Apparently she eavesdropped on our conversation during lunch, and she knows that Archer is Gilgamesh and that he possesses a Noble Phantasm even more powerful than Saber's.::
18206::$$$message_0169_0027_0000$$$::"Well, I'm going to go back home for now. I'll need to grab a weapon for myself, prepare something that will lure Lancer out, and I also need to get medicine for Illya."[lr]::
18207::$$$message_0169_0027_0001$$$::"Medicine for Illya?[lr]::
18208::$$$message_0169_0027_0002$$$::Tohsaka, is there something wrong with Illya!?"::
18209::$$$message_0169_0028_0000$$$::"Not really. She's the same as yesterday. Her breathing's stable and her fever's down. She's just not her usual, energetic self.[lr]::
18210::$$$message_0169_0028_0001$$$::I'm sure she'll wake up if she gets hungry, so make her something tasty when that happens."::
18211::$$$message_0169_0029_0000$$$::She places an empty rice bowl on the table.[lr]::
18212::$$$message_0169_0029_0001$$$::I can't believe Tohsaka was even here eating lunch this whole time...::
18213::$$$message_0169_0030_0000$$$::"See you. I'll be back by dinner, so behave yourselves until then."::
18214::$$$message_0169_0031_0000$$$::Once Tohsaka has left, Saber and I don't have much to do together, so I just blankly stare at the clock as it ticks away.[lr]::
18215::$$$message_0169_0031_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
18216::$$$message_0169_0031_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
18217::$$$message_0169_0031_0003$$$::I can't say why, but the living room feels a little tense.::
18218::$$$message_0169_0032_0000$$$::"Um, Shirou?"[lr]::
18219::$$$message_0169_0032_0001$$$::"D-do you want another cup of tea, Saber?"[lr]::
18220::$$$message_0169_0032_0002$$$::We both look up at the same time, but we both freeze when our eyes meet.::
18221::$$$message_0169_0033_0000$$$::"Wh-what is it, Saber? If there's something on your mind, tell me."[lr]::
18222::$$$message_0169_0033_0001$$$::"N-no. Um...yes! Please, I would like another cup of tea."[lr]::
18223::$$$message_0169_0033_0002$$$::"G-got it. Hold on a minute."::
18224::$$$message_0169_0034_0000$$$::A nerve-racking hour passes by.[lr]::
18225::$$$message_0169_0034_0001$$$::Since we're not doing anything, we might as well train at the dojo or just lie down to rest.[lr]::
18226::$$$message_0169_0034_0002$$$::Neither Saber nor I bring either idea up.::
18227::$$$message_0169_0035_0000$$$::Even I know this is entirely too awkward.[lr]::
18228::$$$message_0169_0035_0001$$$::I know, but I just want to keep spending time with Saber.[lr]::
18229::$$$message_0169_0035_0002$$$::No matter how tense or nervous I am around her[line2]and I've already had ten cups of tea[line2]I just want to relish the moment and watch her face.::
18230::$$$message_0169_0036_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
18231::$$$message_0169_0036_0001$$$::And then...[lr]::
18232::$$$message_0169_0036_0002$$$::When I get up to go to the kitchen, the doorbell rings.::
18233::$$$message_0169_0037_0000$$$::"A visitor? At this hour?"[lr]::
18234::$$$message_0169_0037_0001$$$::It's rare for anyone to visit here.[lr]::
18235::$$$message_0169_0037_0002$$$::Sakura's the only one who'd ring the doorbell, and she's supposed to stay away until the war ends.[lr]::
18236::$$$message_0169_0037_0003$$$::Fuji-nee's still at home recuperating too, and I don't have much of a relationship with the neighbors.::
18237::$$$message_0169_0038_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
18238::$$$message_0169_0038_0001$$$::"Yeah, come with me, Saber. I might have to ask you to deal with whoever it is, if it comes to that."[lr]::
18239::$$$message_0169_0038_0002$$$::"Of course. I will protect you."::
18240::$$$message_0169_0039_0000$$$::"Who is it?"[lr]::
18241::$$$message_0169_0039_0001$$$::I call to the visitor through the closed door.[lr]::
18242::$$$message_0169_0039_0002$$$::"I am from the church. I have come to report the results of the investigation you requested."::
18243::$$$message_0169_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18244::$$$message_0169_0040_0001$$$::I stop breathing for a second.[lr]::
18245::$$$message_0169_0040_0002$$$::It's the very man I went to see this morning.::
18246::$$$message_0169_0041_0000$$$::"Shirou? Is something the matter? You do not look well..."[lr]::
18247::$$$message_0169_0041_0001$$$::"No, it's okay. Can I open the door, Saber? I'll send him away if you don't want him here."::
18248::$$$message_0169_0042_0000$$$::That first night, Saber refused to go inside the church.[lr]::
18249::$$$message_0169_0042_0001$$$::I remember that, which is why I ask.::
18250::$$$message_0169_0043_0000$$$::"I do not mind. I will abide by your decision."[lr]::
18251::$$$message_0169_0043_0001$$$::I nod once and open the front door.::
18252::$$$message_0169_0044_0000$$$::"That took longer than expected. Is there some reason you did not want to see me, Shirou Emiya?"[lr]::
18253::$$$message_0169_0044_0001$$$::"No, nothing like that. I was just surprised. I didn't expect you to come all the way here. If you want to discuss something, come on in."::
18254::$$$message_0169_0045_0000$$$::I beckon Kotomine towards the living room.[lr]::
18255::$$$message_0169_0045_0001$$$::However...[lr]::
18256::$$$message_0169_0045_0002$$$::"No, let us just stand out here and talk. I have not discovered much, so it should not be a long conversation."[lr]::
18257::$$$message_0169_0045_0003$$$::Kotomine draws back, like he's trying to leave.::
18258::$$$message_0169_0046_0000$$$::"Hey. Where are you going, Kotomine?"[lr]::
18259::$$$message_0169_0046_0001$$$::"As I said, we will stand out here and talk. I cannot do that with your Servant behind you, glaring at me with such murderous intent. If she continues that, I may have to rethink my position, for my own sake."::
18260::$$$message_0169_0047_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
18261::$$$message_0169_0047_0001$$$::I look back at Saber.[lr]::
18262::$$$message_0169_0047_0002$$$::"Saber!?"[lr]::
18263::$$$message_0169_0047_0003$$$::Kotomine's right.[lr]::
18264::$$$message_0169_0047_0004$$$::Saber looks so viciously murderous that even I find myself paling.::
18265::$$$message_0169_0048_0000$$$::"What does a Master from the previous war want? If I recall correctly, Kiritsugu shot and killed you."::
18266::$$$message_0169_0049_0000$$$::"You are correct. I abandoned my role and surrendered, hands in the air. He shot me from behind. If not for God's divine protection, I would have died then and there.[lr]::
18267::$$$message_0169_0049_0001$$$::But what of it? It must feel like only yesterday to you, but it is long in the past for me. A full decade has passed. Must you revisit a battle that has long since concluded?"::
18268::$$$message_0169_0050_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18269::$$$message_0169_0050_0001$$$::His words do nothing to calm Saber down.[lr]::
18270::$$$message_0169_0050_0002$$$::"Saber, Kotomine's right. I want you to forget about the last war for now."::
18271::$$$message_0169_0051_0000$$$::"Shirou, do not under any circumstance let your guard down in this man's presence. Kiritsugu targeted this priest from the very beginning because he was a dangerous enemy who needed to be eliminated. Immediately."::
18272::$$$message_0169_0052_0000$$$::"How flattering to hear that coming from the mouth of one who survived until the very end. That says a great deal about my abilities."::
18273::$$$message_0169_0053_0000$$$::"How dare you be so impudent!?"[lr]::
18274::$$$message_0169_0053_0001$$$::The air grows heavy with tension.[lr]::
18275::$$$message_0169_0053_0002$$$::Not good.[lr]::
18276::$$$message_0169_0053_0003$$$::I'm not sure I can hold Saber back.::
18277::$$$message_0169_0054_0000$$$::"Hold it, Saber. I asked Kotomine to investigate Gilgamesh for me. We may know his identity, but we don't know anything beyond that.[lr]::
18278::$$$message_0169_0054_0001$$$::And right now, the more we know about him, the better."::
18279::$$$message_0169_0055_0000$$$::"Y-yes, that may be true, but..."::
18280::$$$message_0169_0056_0000$$$::"I am happy to tell you or leave. As I said, there is not a great deal of information anyway.[lr]::
18281::$$$message_0169_0056_0001$$$::But I am not entirely without feelings here.[lr]::
18282::$$$message_0169_0056_0002$$$::It is not exactly enjoyable to be received so rudely and met with such hostility by the former Servant of a man who shot me through the chest. I am not so experienced, so I may struggle to maintain the composure expected of a priest."::
18283::$$$message_0169_0057_0000$$$::"I feel much the same. I will not warm to a former enemy."[lr]::
18284::$$$message_0169_0057_0001$$$::The two glare at each other.[lr]::
18285::$$$message_0169_0057_0002$$$::This isn't going anywhere.::
18286::$$$message_0169_0058_0000$$$::"Saber, stand back. I want to hear what Kotomine has to say."[lr]::
18287::$$$message_0169_0058_0001$$$::"Shirou!? You mustn't! This man is dangerous. If you are to listen to what he has to say, I shall..."::
18288::$$$message_0169_0059_0000$$$::"Yeah. I understand how you feel, but I'm still a Master. Even if something were to happen to me, I won't just die right away. You'll be able to reach me if something happens. There's no danger now."::
18289::$$$message_0169_0060_0000$$$::Of course not. A mere human could never hope to outmaneuver a Servant.[lr]::
18290::$$$message_0169_0060_0001$$$::Shirou Emiya, your Servant appears to be overprotective."::
18291::$$$message_0169_0061_0000$$$::"Well, try not to push her buttons so much.[lr]::
18292::$$$message_0169_0061_0001$$$::I'm just going to hear what you have to say. I'll have Saber stay back. That's good enough, right?"::
18293::$$$message_0169_0062_0000$$$::"Actually, no. I do not feel like talking here. There would be no place for me to run if Saber attacks.[lr]::
18294::$$$message_0169_0062_0001$$$::If I recall, there is a courtyard here. I should have a few seconds to flee even if Saber goes mad. That should be enough time for you to employ a Command Spell to stop Saber."::
18295::$$$message_0169_0063_0000$$$::"Fine. But I can say for sure that won't happen.[lr]::
18296::$$$message_0169_0063_0001$$$::Saber. Wait on the veranda. I'll call for you if something happens."[lr]::
18297::$$$message_0169_0063_0002$$$::"...Yes. If those are Master's orders."::
18298::$$$message_0169_0064_0000$$$::"Hm. This is fine. There's a nice opening, and I can take in the entire mansion from here."[lr]::
18299::$$$message_0169_0064_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
18300::$$$message_0169_0064_0002$$$::We stand about two meters apart.[lr]::
18301::$$$message_0169_0064_0003$$$::It might be hard to hear if he whispers, but it's enough of a distance for me to react if something happens.::
18302::$$$message_0169_0065_0000$$$::"So, what did you find out, Kotomine?"[lr]::
18303::$$$message_0169_0065_0001$$$::"Hm? Ah, yes. There's something I'd like to confirm with you first."::
18304::$$$message_0169_0066_0000$$$::He gives a deep, seemingly benevolent smile.[lr]::
18305::$$$message_0169_0066_0001$$$::Kotomine takes a step closer.[lr]::
18306::$$$message_0169_0066_0002$$$::"I apologize for being absent this morning. Here. You forgot something."[lr]::
18307::$$$message_0169_0066_0003$$$::I hear a heavy thud.[lr]::
18308::$$$message_0169_0066_0004$$$::Kotomine throws something onto the grass.::
18309::$$$message_0169_0066_0005$$$::"That's the Bounded Field!"[lr]::
18310::$$$message_0169_0066_0006$$$::The alarm goes off.[lr]::
18311::$$$message_0169_0066_0007$$$::The Bounded Field my old man put up[line2]the one meant to sound an alarm when intruders with malicious intent enter the area[line2]is ringing!?::
18312::$$$message_0169_0067_0000$$$::"Lancer is the cause of the commotion. He must have come here with the same goal."::
18313::$$$message_0169_0068_0000$$$::I barely hear Kotomine.[lr]::
18314::$$$message_0169_0068_0001$$$::No, I'm busy staring at the thing he threw at my feet.[lr]::
18315::$$$message_0169_0068_0002$$$::It occupies my entire attention...because it looks like the corpse of a small child.::
18316::$$$message_0169_0069_0000$$$::"So Saber has engaged the intruder. He cannot fight at full power while he is inside. He will need to figure out another strategy if he's to capture Illyasviel."::
18317::$$$message_0169_0070_0000$$$::...It's not a corpse.[lr]::
18318::$$$message_0169_0070_0001$$$::It's alive.[lr]::
18319::$$$message_0169_0070_0002$$$::The child looks so miserable, I want to avert my eyes. But it's alive. Its face isn't even identifiable...::
18320::$$$message_0169_0071_0000$$$::"...Wh...y?"[lr]::
18321::$$$message_0169_0071_0001$$$::A sharp, heavy object pierces my heart from behind.::
18322::$$$message_0169_0072_0000$$$::"A mere human could not possibly outmaneuver a Servant.[lr]::
18323::$$$message_0169_0072_0001$$$::It is obvious. To do so, one must use a Servant."::
18324::$$$message_0169_0073_0000$$$::I don't care about the priest's chilling smile.[lr]::
18325::$$$message_0169_0073_0001$$$::I don't even care that my heart's been destroyed and I'm spitting up blood.::
18326::$$$message_0169_0074_0000$$$::"Why...would you...?"::
18327::$$$message_0169_0075_0000$$$::Questions are all that occupy my mind.[lr]::
18328::$$$message_0169_0075_0001$$$::Why...do I...[lr]::
18329::$$$message_0169_0075_0002$$$::Recognize a corpse that's not even human anymore?::
