14792::$$$message_0139_0000_0000$$$::The sky is gray, the hill crimson with corpses.[lr]::
14793::$$$message_0139_0000_0001$$$::The heavy clouds drift away, heralding the battle's end.::
14794::$$$message_0139_0001_0000$$$::I know this scene. I've seen it so many times now.[lr]::
14795::$$$message_0139_0001_0001$$$::This is one of Saber's battles.[lr]::
14796::$$$message_0139_0001_0002$$$::She fought and won so many victories, scenes like this are almost commonplace for her.[lr]::
14797::$$$message_0139_0001_0003$$$::Afterwards, she will return to her castle, where her victory will be praised and celebrated. Then she will prepare for the next battle.::
14798::$$$message_0139_0002_0000$$$::This is just...life for her.[lr]::
14799::$$$message_0139_0002_0001$$$::It is only one of the twelve great battles she fought.[lr]::
14800::$$$message_0139_0002_0002$$$::And so she does not truly remember victory, so much as she just accepts it as a fact.[lr]::
14801::$$$message_0139_0002_0003$$$::I think she's misguided.::
14802::$$$message_0139_0003_0000$$$::   This is not a dream.[lr]::
14803::$$$message_0139_0003_0001$$$::   It's just a cold reality... Her past that can't be changed.::
14804::$$$message_0139_0004_0000$$$::The moment she drew the sword, she stopped being human.[lr]::
14805::$$$message_0139_0004_0001$$$::She took over for her father as a feudal lord, and became a king with many knights.[lr]::
14806::$$$message_0139_0004_0002$$$::She was known as King Arthur, and Altria. The life of the girl who once aspired to be a knight changed so radically.::
14807::$$$message_0139_0005_0000$$$::   No.[lr]::
14808::$$$message_0139_0005_0001$$$::"Was forced to end her life as she knew it" might be a better way to put it.[lr]::
14809::$$$message_0139_0005_0002$$$::In that instant, the girl who still had such childlike features ceased to be, and became the King of Knights.::
14810::$$$message_0139_0006_0000$$$::She acted like she was the king's son.[lr]::
14811::$$$message_0139_0006_0001$$$::The ruler of territories and knights had to be male.[lr]::
14812::$$$message_0139_0006_0002$$$::Only her father and the mage knew the king was female.[lr]::
14813::$$$message_0139_0006_0003$$$::She covered herself in iron and hid that truth for the rest of her life.::
14814::$$$message_0139_0007_0000$$$::I don't know why I never realized the implications until now.[lr]::
14815::$$$message_0139_0007_0001$$$::As much public exposure as she had, she managed to pass herself off as male the whole time.[lr]::
14816::$$$message_0139_0007_0002$$$::The sheer suffering she likely endured must have been incredible. But a simple observer could never really understand.::
14817::$$$message_0139_0008_0000$$$::...Time passes.[lr]::
14818::$$$message_0139_0008_0001$$$::Ten years' worth of memories as king.[lr]::
14819::$$$message_0139_0008_0002$$$::And there was only one common thread that entire time...[lr]::
14820::$$$message_0139_0008_0003$$$::Even when she's on the throne...[lr]::
14821::$$$message_0139_0008_0004$$$::Even when she's walking through the hallway...[lr]::
14822::$$$message_0139_0008_0005$$$::Even when she's on the battlefield...[lr]::
14823::$$$message_0139_0008_0006$$$::Not a soul spoke to her.[lr]::
14824::$$$message_0139_0008_0007$$$::Even the Round Table, filled as it was with knights boasting of their valor, always fell silent the moment the king appeared. ::
14825::$$$message_0139_0009_0000$$$::So that's what it meant.[lr]::
14826::$$$message_0139_0009_0001$$$::She was merely tolerated as an idol.[lr]::
14827::$$$message_0139_0009_0002$$$::Many knights looked down on Altria, with her boyish appearance, and were ultimately not comfortable entrusting her with their blades.::
14828::$$$message_0139_0010_0000$$$::But because she managed to draw the sacred sword that no one else could, they had to obey, even if only to keep up appearances.[lr]::
14829::$$$message_0139_0010_0001$$$::They just accepted the disgrace, believed it would pass.::
14830::$$$message_0139_0011_0000$$$::Sacred sword or no, the king was merely a child.[lr]::
14831::$$$message_0139_0011_0001$$$::Even with Merlin's support, the king would surely fail eventually.[lr]::
14832::$$$message_0139_0011_0002$$$::When that happens, they need only take the sacred sword from her and select a new king.[lr]::
14833::$$$message_0139_0011_0003$$$::That's probably what most of the knights thought.::
14834::$$$message_0139_0012_0000$$$::But that's not how it went.[lr]::
14835::$$$message_0139_0012_0001$$$::The knight, only just reaching adulthood, was a flawless king.[lr]::
14836::$$$message_0139_0012_0002$$$::She enforced peace among the squabbling lords, and fought off invaders as well.[lr]::
14837::$$$message_0139_0012_0003$$$::Of course, this wasn't due to the sacred sword's powers.[lr]::
14838::$$$message_0139_0012_0004$$$::The sacred sword only protects the king.[lr]::
14839::$$$message_0139_0012_0005$$$::The king, on the other hand, protects their nation.::
14840::$$$message_0139_0013_0000$$$::And through her deeds she was always able to maintain control of her knights.[lr]::
14841::$$$message_0139_0013_0001$$$::The sacred sword protects her only from her enemies.[lr]::
14842::$$$message_0139_0013_0002$$$::It does nothing to help her hold sway over the hearts of her subjects.[lr]::
14843::$$$message_0139_0013_0003$$$::She worked herself to the bone to be the ideal king to all.::
14844::$$$message_0139_0014_0000$$$::At that point, the knights had no choice but to obey.[lr]::
14845::$$$message_0139_0014_0001$$$::They held their dissatisfaction for the young king in check, because the king was truly perfect.[lr]::
14846::$$$message_0139_0014_0002$$$::She strived to be an ideal king.[lr]::
14847::$$$message_0139_0014_0003$$$::The only condition for the knights' support was that their king be exactly that: the ideal king.[lr]::
14848::$$$message_0139_0014_0004$$$::There was no room for Altria to be a human being.::
14849::$$$message_0139_0015_0000$$$::She could be a king, and only a king.[lr]::
14850::$$$message_0139_0015_0001$$$::The peerless knight who drew the sacred sword, who stopped aging from that moment, and who went on to win twelve great wars.[lr]::
14851::$$$message_0139_0015_0002$$$::The more perfect she became, the more people stayed away from her.[lr]::
14852::$$$message_0139_0015_0003$$$::As this continued, the king grew more and more isolated.[lr]::
14853::$$$message_0139_0015_0004$$$::That was who she was.::
14854::$$$message_0139_0016_0000$$$::But she did well.[lr]::
14855::$$$message_0139_0016_0001$$$::In fact, she did too well.[lr]::
14856::$$$message_0139_0016_0002$$$::She defeated her enemies and minimized her own side's casualties.[lr]::
14857::$$$message_0139_0016_0003$$$::No matter the battle, sacrifices must be made.[lr]::
14858::$$$message_0139_0016_0004$$$::So she believed it was her duty to make sacrifices, to bolster her army, and to defeat the enemy without wasting lives.::
14859::$$$message_0139_0017_0000$$$::She would strip the resources from one village to prepare her army, then defeat the invaders before they could strike her land, saving perhaps ten villages.[lr]::
14860::$$$message_0139_0017_0001$$$::That was the king's approach, and it proved the best strategy at the time.::
14861::$$$message_0139_0018_0000$$$::But the knights must not have been happy. [lr]::
14862::$$$message_0139_0018_0001$$$::To them, only the foreign invaders should have died, and the only true victory is made without any such sacrifices.[lr]::
14863::$$$message_0139_0018_0002$$$::There shouldn't be any need to sacrifice a territory before battle.[lr]::
14864::$$$message_0139_0018_0003$$$::They were going to win regardless, so the sacrifices were pointless.[lr]::
14865::$$$message_0139_0018_0004$$$::There wouldn't be any sacrifices, so the king's actions were a waste.::
14866::$$$message_0139_0019_0000$$$::It was, of course, total nonsense.[lr]::
14867::$$$message_0139_0019_0001$$$::Once battle began, the knights spared not a thought for those little villages. No one thought twice about trampling the villages. Protecting them was never a consideration.[lr]::
14868::$$$message_0139_0019_0002$$$::The knights claim there's nothing to be done when the enemy destroys such villages. But to let them be destroyed is a great crime.::
14869::$$$message_0139_0020_0000$$$::Obviously she knew that.[lr]::
14870::$$$message_0139_0020_0001$$$::But a king cannot worry about their personal feelings.[lr]::
14871::$$$message_0139_0020_0002$$$::She had to kill her emotions to make her decisions, and her knights had to suppress their own feelings to obey.[lr]::
14872::$$$message_0139_0020_0003$$$::And so sacrifices are made, and that string of victories stabilizes the nation.::
14873::$$$message_0139_0021_0000$$$::And in return, animosity for the king grew.[lr]::
14874::$$$message_0139_0021_0001$$$::"King Arthur just doesn't understand how [font italic=true]people[font italic=false] feel."[lr]::
14875::$$$message_0139_0021_0002$$$::So one knight was heard to say as they left the castle.[lr]::
14876::$$$message_0139_0021_0003$$$::What a ridiculous story.[lr]::
14877::$$$message_0139_0021_0004$$$::She was expected not to be human, but they hated her precisely because she didn't have human emotions.::
14878::$$$message_0139_0022_0000$$$::The age of war continued.[lr]::
14879::$$$message_0139_0022_0001$$$::The animosity of the knights who had been dissatisfied with the king only grew more so after that knight left. [lr]::
14880::$$$message_0139_0022_0002$$$::They forced her to deal with every foreign and domestic enemy in hopes of pushing her over the edge.::
14881::$$$message_0139_0023_0000$$$::Collapse was imminent.[lr]::
14882::$$$message_0139_0023_0001$$$::If these many problems confronting the nation were never resolved, it would crumble.[lr]::
14883::$$$message_0139_0023_0002$$$::Even if all of them were to be resolved, what awaits is more of the same.::
14884::$$$message_0139_0024_0000$$$::But that did not concern the king.[lr]::
14885::$$$message_0139_0024_0001$$$::Even should she be abandoned, feared or betrayed, she will remain steadfast.[lr]::
14886::$$$message_0139_0024_0002$$$::Because she had long since made up her mind.[lr]::
14887::$$$message_0139_0024_0003$$$::She abandoned her emotions the moment she decided to draw that sword.::
14888::$$$message_0139_0025_0000$$$::This happened long, long ago.[lr]::
14889::$$$message_0139_0025_0001$$$::Knights from across the nation gathered to try to draw the sword from the stone.[lr]::
14890::$$$message_0139_0025_0002$$$::But none of them could do it, and the knights instead showcased their skill on horseback, eager to crown the best among them king.[lr]::
14891::$$$message_0139_0025_0003$$$::The knights flocked to the arena in droves. The sword in the stone lay outside, forgotten.::
14892::$$$message_0139_0026_0000$$$::From afar, it looked more like a festival.[lr]::
14893::$$$message_0139_0026_0001$$$::Even in the distance, the sound of valiant cavalrymen clashing is audible.[lr]::
14894::$$$message_0139_0026_0002$$$::The knights clashed in the distance, and the rock lay forgotten.[lr]::
14895::$$$message_0139_0026_0003$$$::What was going through the girl's mind as she stood in front of the rock?[lr]::
14896::$$$message_0139_0026_0004$$$::Before she realized it, an unknown mage stood behind her.::
14897::$$$message_0139_0027_0000$$$::"Think before you take hold of that."::
14898::$$$message_0139_0028_0000$$$::He tries to stop her, for her own good.::
14899::$$$message_0139_0029_0000$$$::"The moment you take that sword, you will cease to be human."::
14900::$$$message_0139_0030_0000$$$::He also warned her that many would hate her, and that she would die a gruesome death.::
14901::$$$message_0139_0031_0000$$$::She must have been terrified.[lr]::
14902::$$$message_0139_0031_0001$$$::The mage showed her the future.[lr]::
14903::$$$message_0139_0031_0002$$$::He showed her the end she would meet if she drew that sword.::
14904::$$$message_0139_0032_0000$$$::"No..."::
14905::$$$message_0139_0033_0000$$$::It only made her all the more determined.[lr]::
14906::$$$message_0139_0033_0001$$$::Even after seeing that future, she only gave a firm nod.[lr]::
14907::$$$message_0139_0033_0002$$$::The mage asked again if that was what she wanted.::
14908::$$$message_0139_0034_0000$$$::"I saw many people smiling.[lr]::
14909::$$$message_0139_0034_0001$$$::So this cannot be a mistake."::
14910::$$$message_0139_0035_0000$$$::She took the sword in her hand.[lr]::
14911::$$$message_0139_0035_0001$$$::The mage looked troubled, and turned away.[lr]::
14912::$$$message_0139_0035_0002$$$::"Miracles come at a price. You will pay with what is most precious to you."[lr]::
14913::$$$message_0139_0035_0003$$$::He departed with those prophetic words.::
14914::$$$message_0139_0036_0000$$$::That's right.[lr]::
14915::$$$message_0139_0036_0001$$$::She just wanted to protect everyone.[lr]::
14916::$$$message_0139_0036_0002$$$::But to do so, she had to abandon her desire to protect people.[lr]::
14917::$$$message_0139_0036_0003$$$::She cannot protect her country as its king if she still has a human heart.::
14918::$$$message_0139_0037_0000$$$::Even knowing this, she drew the sword.[lr]::
14919::$$$message_0139_0037_0001$$$::Even knowing this, she vowed to live as a king.[lr]::
14920::$$$message_0139_0037_0002$$$::So no matter what happens, she will remain steadfast.[lr]::
14921::$$$message_0139_0037_0003$$$::She abandoned her human heart.[lr]::
14922::$$$message_0139_0037_0004$$$::She was willing to give that up to protect her nation.::
14923::$$$message_0139_0038_0000$$$::Who could have known the girl made such a noble oath?[lr]::
14924::$$$message_0139_0038_0001$$$::   She was determined to fight.[lr]::
14925::$$$message_0139_0038_0002$$$::Come what may, and however might end...[lr]::
14926::$$$message_0139_0038_0003$$$::   She still decided to fight.[lr]::
14927::$$$message_0139_0038_0004$$$::Even if an inevitable, solitary doom awaited her.::
14928::$$$message_0139_0039_0000$$$::And her end did come.[lr]::
14929::$$$message_0139_0039_0001$$$::The Battle of Camlann.[lr]::
14930::$$$message_0139_0039_0002$$$::King Arthur set out on a campaign, and one of her knights usurped her throne, splitting the nation in two...and sparking a terrible conflict.[lr]::
14931::$$$message_0139_0039_0003$$$::Legend has it that this battle brought an end to knighthood and chivalry.::
14932::$$$message_0139_0040_0000$$$::She killed every knight who once served her, and invaded the land she'd fought to defend.[lr]::
14933::$$$message_0139_0040_0001$$$::All the knights who followed her were gone, and her own body lay injured and immobile.::
14934::$$$message_0139_0041_0000$$$::There was no one left around her.[lr]::
14935::$$$message_0139_0041_0001$$$::As ever, nothing has changed.[lr]::
14936::$$$message_0139_0041_0002$$$::All she had in her heart was the pride of a king.[lr]::
14937::$$$message_0139_0041_0003$$$::She'd known about this ending.[lr]::
14938::$$$message_0139_0041_0004$$$::Still, she believed there was something to be gained from this failure, which is why she kept fighting without ever failing or disgracing herself.::
14939::$$$message_0139_0042_0000$$$::She had not regrets.[lr]::
14940::$$$message_0139_0042_0001$$$::If she were to have one, it would be seeing her nation in ruin.::
14941::$$$message_0139_0043_0000$$$::She raised her gaze.[lr]::
14942::$$$message_0139_0043_0001$$$::Maybe she would be able to see her castle in the distance from this hill.[lr]::
14943::$$$message_0139_0043_0002$$$::She saw only the aftermath of the battle, a dense forest, and a lake to which she must return.::
14944::$$$message_0139_0044_0000$$$::   That's right.[lr]::
14945::$$$message_0139_0044_0001$$$::The hill she'd meant to charge over has become a wall she can't climb.::
14946::$$$message_0139_0045_0000$$$::Strength left her body.[lr]::
14947::$$$message_0139_0045_0001$$$::For the first time, she loosened her grip on the sacred sword.::
14948::$$$message_0139_0046_0000$$$::And that's where it ended.[lr]::
14949::$$$message_0139_0046_0001$$$::It was only natural that the dream would end here.[lr]::
14950::$$$message_0139_0046_0002$$$::Since there is nothing beyond that moment in her memories.::
14951::$$$message_0139_0047_0000$$$::And that is why this end cannot be rewritten.[lr]::
14952::$$$message_0139_0047_0001$$$::She worked so hard, and she was resented, betrayed.[lr]::
14953::$$$message_0139_0047_0002$$$::Nobody understood that she loved her people more than her nation. She came to be known as a merciless king.[lr]::
14954::$$$message_0139_0047_0003$$$::She was never rewarded or understood.[lr]::
14955::$$$message_0139_0047_0004$$$::On top of the crimson-stained, sword-strewn hill, the girl sat on the edge of death, isolated and betrayed...::
14956::$$$message_0139_0048_0000$$$::I wake to the sound of rain.[lr]::
14957::$$$message_0139_0048_0001$$$::"It's morning..."[lr]::
14958::$$$message_0139_0048_0002$$$::I grip my spinning head and sit up.[lr]::
14959::$$$message_0139_0048_0003$$$::It's just before six o'clock.[lr]::
14960::$$$message_0139_0048_0004$$$::The rain patters softly outside.::
14961::$$$message_0139_0050_0000$$$::"...That dream I just had..."[lr]::
14962::$$$message_0139_0050_0001$$$::No, there's no doubt about it.[lr]::
14963::$$$message_0139_0050_0002$$$::It was Saber's past.[lr]::
14964::$$$message_0139_0050_0003$$$::It was the end of her life a long, long time ago. Nothing can change it now.::
14965::$$$message_0139_0051_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14966::$$$message_0139_0051_0001$$$::I grit my teeth.[lr]::
14967::$$$message_0139_0051_0002$$$::I can [font italic=true]hear[font italic=false] them grinding.[lr]::
14968::$$$message_0139_0051_0003$$$::I don't know why, but I'm so mad.::
14969::$$$message_0139_0052_0000$$$::"Damn. What the hell was that?"[lr]::
14970::$$$message_0139_0052_0001$$$::Just thinking about it pisses me off.[lr]::
14971::$$$message_0139_0052_0002$$$::Her past...the fact that she didn't think anything of it...me thinking the dream was nothing before...::
14972::$$$message_0139_0053_0000$$$::"Arrrgh!"[lr]::
14973::$$$message_0139_0053_0001$$$::I hate it.[lr]::
14974::$$$message_0139_0053_0002$$$::I don't even understand why, but it's making me angry.::
14975::$$$message_0139_0054_0000$$$::I don't like it.[lr]::
14976::$$$message_0139_0054_0001$$$::I don't like it one damn bit.[lr]::
14977::$$$message_0139_0054_0002$$$::No matter how you slice it, her life was unfair.[lr]::
14978::$$$message_0139_0054_0003$$$::So, so unfair.[lr]::
14979::$$$message_0139_0054_0004$$$::She only wanted to help people. She wanted nothing for herself.[lr]::
14980::$$$message_0139_0054_0005$$$::But, as hard as she worked, nobody understood her, not even at the very end. That...really pisses me off.[lr]::
14981::$$$message_0139_0054_0006$$$::It's so unfair...::
14982::$$$message_0139_0055_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14983::$$$message_0139_0055_0001$$$::That's right.[lr]::
14984::$$$message_0139_0055_0002$$$::If she worked harder than anyone, and she doesn't receive [font italic=true]any[font italic=false] reward, it's all just a bunch of crap.[lr]::
14985::$$$message_0139_0055_0003$$$::She should be rewarded for everything she's done.::
14986::$$$message_0139_0056_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14987::$$$message_0139_0056_0001$$$::But...[lr]::
14988::$$$message_0139_0056_0002$$$::How could that happen at this point?[lr]::
14989::$$$message_0139_0056_0003$$$::I...what, just tell her she did a good job?[lr]::
14990::$$$message_0139_0056_0004$$$::Do I tell her how wonderful she was?[lr]::
14991::$$$message_0139_0056_0005$$$::Of course not.[lr]::
14992::$$$message_0139_0056_0006$$$::Nothing so simple could do her justice.::
14993::$$$message_0139_0057_0000$$$::"I know. There's only one answer."[lr]::
14994::$$$message_0139_0057_0001$$$::That's right...[lr]::
14995::$$$message_0139_0057_0002$$$::If she's to be rewarded, the work she devoted her life to should be repaid.[lr]::
14996::$$$message_0139_0057_0003$$$::Altria needs happiness to match all the battles she fought.::
14997::$$$message_0139_0058_0000$$$::But then, what can I do?"[lr]::
14998::$$$message_0139_0058_0001$$$::I'm out of ideas.[lr]::
14999::$$$message_0139_0058_0002$$$::I don't have any idea how to make people happy.::
15000::$$$message_0139_0059_0000$$$::I'm so useless at this kind of thing.[lr]::
15001::$$$message_0139_0059_0001$$$::My entire life, I've wanted to be a champion of justice, but all I ever did was lend a hand here and there.[lr]::
15002::$$$message_0139_0059_0002$$$::I believed everyone around me would be happy if I just helped people.[lr]::
15003::$$$message_0139_0059_0003$$$::Or rather...[lr]::
15004::$$$message_0139_0059_0004$$$::I couldn't face myself if I didn't believe that.::
15005::$$$message_0139_0060_0000$$$::"Hngh!"[lr]::
15006::$$$message_0139_0060_0001$$$::Helping people and [font italic=true]saving[font italic=false] people are very much not the same thing.[lr]::
15007::$$$message_0139_0060_0002$$$::And if I don't understand the difference myself, I can't possibly reward Saber...::
