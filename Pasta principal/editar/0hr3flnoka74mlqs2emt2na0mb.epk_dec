66590::$$$message_0616_0000_0000$$$::In the end, we got home before midnight.[lr]::
66591::$$$message_0616_0000_0001$$$::We decided there wasn't any point in wasting our stamina when there was nothing else to do.::
66592::$$$message_0616_0001_0000$$$::    My feet feel heavy.[lr]::
66593::$$$message_0616_0001_0001$$$::The physical stress of training all day must be catching up with me.[lr]::
66594::$$$message_0616_0001_0002$$$::My body feels like lead, and my eyelids might droop closed at any moment.::
66595::$$$message_0616_0002_0000$$$::...I'm sleepy.[lr]::
66596::$$$message_0616_0002_0001$$$::Maybe my mind's worse off than my body.[lr]::
66597::$$$message_0616_0002_0002$$$::I want to sleep so badly I might just curl up on the floor in this hallway.::
66598::$$$message_0616_0003_0000$$$::"Welcome back. How did the town look, Rin?"[lr]::
66599::$$$message_0616_0003_0001$$$::Illya was waiting for us in the living room.[lr]::
66600::$$$message_0616_0003_0002$$$::...Sakura isn't here.[lr]::
66601::$$$message_0616_0003_0003$$$::Of course not.[lr]::
66602::$$$message_0616_0003_0004$$$::Sakura's...[lr]::
66603::$$$message_0616_0003_0005$$$::"...Nrgh."[lr]::
66604::$$$message_0616_0003_0006$$$::No.[lr]::
66605::$$$message_0616_0003_0007$$$::Sakura should be sleeping in her room right now.::
66606::$$$message_0616_0004_0000$$$::"We got there after it happened. How's Sakura?"[lr]::
66607::$$$message_0616_0004_0001$$$::"Nothing happened to her. She's sleeping in bed, and it doesn't seem like she woke up. I think she's doing a little better thanks to the energy saved from not using Rider."::
66608::$$$message_0616_0005_0000$$$::"Okay. Still, be careful. There's no telling when she might go out of control again."[lr]::
66609::$$$message_0616_0005_0001$$$::It doesn't seem like Tohsaka's any worse off after seeing that ghost town.::
66610::$$$message_0616_0006_0000$$$::"I'm tired, so I'm going to bed. What about you, Illya?"[lr]::
66611::$$$message_0616_0006_0001$$$::"I'm going to rest too. We're going to forge it tomorrow, so I'd better get enough sleep so we don't fail."[lr]::
66612::$$$message_0616_0006_0002$$$::Illya bids us good night and goes off to the tatami room.::
66613::$$$message_0616_0007_0000$$$::"That's it for today, then. Get some rest, Shirou. I don't think you've noticed, but you're really pale."::
66614::$$$message_0616_0008_0000$$$::...My body feels heavy.[lr]::
66615::$$$message_0616_0008_0001$$$::I do manage to roll out my futon even through my brain fog, thanks to daily muscle memory.::
66616::$$$message_0616_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66617::$$$message_0616_0009_0001$$$::I collapse into bed.[lr]::
66618::$$$message_0616_0009_0002$$$::When I roll onto my back and look up at the ceiling, I make a little time to think.::
66619::$$$message_0616_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66620::$$$message_0616_0010_0001$$$::I try to think with my exhausted brain.::
66621::$$$message_0616_0011_0000$$$::I think about my left arm.[lr]::
66622::$$$message_0616_0011_0001$$$::About loosening the shroud today.[lr]::
66623::$$$message_0616_0011_0002$$$::After experiencing unbearable agony and terror last night, I easily overcome it in a day.[lr]::
66624::$$$message_0616_0011_0003$$$::It ended so easily, the pain and fear might well have never existed.[lr]::
66625::$$$message_0616_0011_0004$$$::If I think seriously about what that means, I know the answer.::
66626::$$$message_0616_0012_0000$$$::I think about Illya.[lr]::
66627::$$$message_0616_0012_0001$$$::She told me that she couldn't live with me.[lr]::
66628::$$$message_0616_0012_0002$$$::She said it would be nice, but that it couldn't happen.[lr]::
66629::$$$message_0616_0012_0003$$$::Because she doesn't have long to live.[lr]::
66630::$$$message_0616_0012_0004$$$::She told me something that anyone would know.::
66631::$$$message_0616_0013_0000$$$::I think about the Sh::
66632::$$$message_0616_0014_0000$$$::I think about Sakura.[lr]::
66633::$$$message_0616_0014_0001$$$::Her life is becoming more confined with each passing day,[lr]::
66634::$$$message_0616_0014_0002$$$::because the Crest Worms are feeding on her body and she doesn't have enough magical energy.[lr]::
66635::$$$message_0616_0014_0003$$$::It isn't her fault.[lr]::
66636::$$$message_0616_0014_0004$$$::It isn't Sakura's fault that her body is this way.[lr]::
66637::$$$message_0616_0014_0005$$$::All I can do for her is share my magical energy.[lr]::
66638::$$$message_0616_0014_0006$$$::If I give her some blood and supply her with enough power, she should hold together.::
66639::$$$message_0616_0015_0000$$$::I close my eyes.[lr]::
66640::$$$message_0616_0015_0001$$$::Illya said that we were all beyond saving.[lr]::
66641::$$$message_0616_0015_0002$$$::There's only one choice to make.[lr]::
66642::$$$message_0616_0015_0003$$$::I made it long ago.::
66643::$$$message_0616_0016_0000$$$::"...Senpai? Are you back...?"[lr]::
66644::$$$message_0616_0016_0001$$$::I hear a voice from the hallway.::
66645::$$$message_0616_0017_0000$$$::"I'm awake. Come in, Sakura."[lr]::
66646::$$$message_0616_0017_0001$$$::I get...up. Even if my...head isn't...working right, I wanted to see Sakura.::
66647::$$$message_0616_0018_0000$$$::"Pardon me. Sorry, I heard something, so I woke up... Um, I haven't said good night to you yet."::
66648::$$$message_0616_0019_0000$$$::Sakura's her usual self.[lr]::
66649::$$$message_0616_0019_0001$$$::She's introverted, thoughtful, and always holds in what she wants to say. But she's still the girl who tries to laugh and means so much to me.[lr]::
66650::$$$message_0616_0019_0002$$$::Over the last year, she's become so stunningly beautiful that now I want to embrace her any time we're alone together. She's the person I promised to protect forever.::
66651::$$$message_0616_0020_0000$$$::"Um, that's all I wanted to say. I feel better thanks to you, and I think I'll sleep well tonight. I just wanted to let you know that you don't need to worry."::
66652::$$$message_0616_0021_0000$$$::Sakura's her usual self.[lr]::
66653::$$$message_0616_0021_0001$$$::Of course she is.[lr]::
66654::$$$message_0616_0021_0002$$$::Why wouldn't she be?[lr]::
66655::$$$message_0616_0021_0003$$$::She couldn't possibly be the Sakura that came onto me that one night.::
66656::$$$message_0616_0022_0000$$$::"...Senpai? Um, am I disturbing you?[lr]::
66657::$$$message_0616_0022_0001$$$::You look really sleepy, or rather, tired..."[lr]::
66658::$$$message_0616_0022_0002$$$::"Sakura. Did you get a good sleep?"[lr]::
66659::$$$message_0616_0022_0003$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
66660::$$$message_0616_0022_0004$$$::But I still voice my anxiety.[lr]::
66661::$$$message_0616_0022_0005$$$::My tired mind can't organize its thoughts.::
66662::$$$message_0616_0023_0000$$$::"Yes. It was a restful nap.[lr]::
66663::$$$message_0616_0023_0001$$$::I still had scary dreams, but I managed to get through them because you stayed with me until I fell asleep."::
66664::$$$message_0616_0024_0000$$$::Scary dreams.[lr]::
66665::$$$message_0616_0024_0001$$$::I know I shouldn't ask what they were.[lr]::
66666::$$$message_0616_0024_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66667::$$$message_0616_0024_0003$$$::I say nothing, and reach for her long hair.::
66668::$$$message_0616_0025_0000$$$::"Huh... Um, Senpai?"[lr]::
66669::$$$message_0616_0025_0001$$$::"Come here, Sakura."[lr]::
66670::$$$message_0616_0025_0002$$$::My hand falls from her hair to her shoulder, and I bring her in close.::
66671::$$$message_0616_0026_0000$$$::"U-um, Senpai! I-I-I...!"[lr]::
66672::$$$message_0616_0026_0001$$$::"You don't like it?"[lr]::
66673::$$$message_0616_0026_0002$$$::I whisper into her ear as I hug her.::
66674::$$$message_0616_0027_0000$$$::Sakura doesn't resist burying her head into my chest.[lr]::
66675::$$$message_0616_0027_0001$$$::"...No. I'm so happy."[lr]::
66676::$$$message_0616_0027_0002$$$::She lets herself relax and snuggles against me.::
66677::$$$message_0616_0028_0000$$$::Then, I hug her very tightly.[lr]::
66678::$$$message_0616_0028_0001$$$::I can't control myself.::
66679::$$$message_0616_0029_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
66680::$$$message_0616_0029_0001$$$::I've always wanted to do this with her.[lr]::
66681::$$$message_0616_0029_0002$$$::There's been so many times I wanted to hug Sakura until I pass out.[lr]::
66682::$$$message_0616_0029_0003$$$::So I do.[lr]::
66683::$$$message_0616_0029_0004$$$::Sakura's voice doesn't reach my brain.[lr]::
66684::$$$message_0616_0029_0005$$$::All I hear is my ragged breathing.::
66685::$$$message_0616_0030_0000$$$::It's Sakura who wants me, who needs me,[lr]::
66686::$$$message_0616_0030_0001$$$::but before I know it, I'm the one who's being satisfied.[lr]::
66687::$$$message_0616_0030_0002$$$::I lose track of time.[lr]::
66688::$$$message_0616_0030_0003$$$::I try to keep watching this nightmare until morning, but the power soon goes out in my body.::
66689::$$$message_0616_0031_0000$$$::I start to fall asleep, still holding Sakura's hand.[lr]::
66690::$$$message_0616_0031_0001$$$::"Mm, mm... Senpai, I'm going to..."[lr]::
66691::$$$message_0616_0031_0002$$$::Savoring her body heat through my hands, I fall into a deep sleep.::
66692::$$$message_0616_0032_0000$$$::...Then, the rational part of me speaks.[lr]::
66693::$$$message_0616_0032_0001$$$::My ecstatic brain recovers its calm in the abyss of sleep.::
66694::$$$message_0616_0033_0000$$$::   What will happen if you do this?[lr]::
66695::$$$message_0616_0033_0001$$$::By drowning yourself in Sakura, maybe you're decisively admitting that your fears are justified.::ья
