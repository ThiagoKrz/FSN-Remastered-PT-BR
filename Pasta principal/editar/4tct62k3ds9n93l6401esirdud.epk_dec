32897::$$$message_0265_0000_0000$$$::Tohsaka says this as she turns to look at Saber.::
32898::$$$message_0265_0001_0000$$$::"So, from what I hear from Emiya here, you must not be in your full form, Saber. You were summoned by a mage apprentice that has no idea of how to be a Master."::
32899::$$$message_0265_0002_0000$$$::"...Yes. Just as you say, I am not in my best form.[lr]::
32900::$$$message_0265_0002_0001$$$::Since Shirou has no magical energy to give me form, it will be difficult to return to spirit form or restore my magical energy."::
32901::$$$message_0265_0003_0000$$$::"...I'm surprised. I mean, I'm surprised it's that bad, but I'm even more surprised you would be so open with me. I was even thinking about how I can try to find out your weaknesses."::
32902::$$$message_0265_0004_0000$$$::"I do not wish for others to know my weakness, but I do not think I can fool you. It would be meaningless to hide our situation from you.[lr]::
32903::$$$message_0265_0004_0001$$$::In that case, it's better for you to know, so Shirou can better understand the current situation."::
32904::$$$message_0265_0005_0000$$$::"Correct. And you're real nice too, too... Ugh, this really sucks! If I was your Master, I would have definitely won!"[lr]::
32905::$$$message_0265_0005_0001$$$::Tohsaka clenches her fists in frustration.::
32906::$$$message_0265_0006_0000$$$::"Hey, Tohsaka. Are you saying that I'm not fit to be her Master?"[lr]::
32907::$$$message_0265_0006_0001$$$::"That's right. You're useless."[lr]::
32908::$$$message_0265_0006_0002$$$::Wow. Said the quiet part out loud without hesitation. Heartless.::
32909::$$$message_0265_0007_0000$$$::"What? Still have questions?"[lr]::
32910::$$$message_0265_0007_0001$$$::She doesn't even realize it, either.[lr]::
32911::$$$message_0265_0007_0002$$$::The model student impression that I had of her from school is crumbling apart.[lr]::
32912::$$$message_0265_0007_0003$$$::...Issei really knows what's up. Tohsaka really is a demon underneath it all.::
32913::$$$message_0265_0008_0000$$$::"Well, then. Now that we're done talking, let's get going."[lr]::
32914::$$$message_0265_0008_0001$$$::And...[lr]::
32915::$$$message_0265_0008_0002$$$::Tohsaka suddenly says something that doesn't make sense.::
32916::$$$message_0265_0009_0000$$$::"Huh? Go where?"[lr]::
32917::$$$message_0265_0009_0001$$$::"To go see someone that knows a lot about this Holy Grail War that you've been dragged into. Emiya, you want to know the reason behind the war, right?"::
32918::$$$message_0265_0010_0000$$$::"...Of course. But, where is that? It's already late, so we shouldn't go that far."[lr]::
32919::$$$message_0265_0010_0001$$$::"It'll be fine. It's over in Shinto, so we can make it back by dawn if we hurry. And besides, tomorrow is Sunday, so staying out late shouldn't be a problem."::
32920::$$$message_0265_0011_0000$$$::"I'm not really worried about that."[lr]::
32921::$$$message_0265_0011_0001$$$::I'm just tired from everything that happened today, so I want to rest and organize my thoughts.::
32922::$$$message_0265_0012_0000$$$::"What, you're not going? If you say so. What about you, Saber?"[lr]::
32923::$$$message_0265_0012_0001$$$::Tohsaka asks Saber her opinion for some reason.[lr]::
32924::$$$message_0265_0012_0002$$$::"Hold on, Saber has nothing to do with this. Don't pressure her."::
32925::$$$message_0265_0013_0000$$$::"Oh, so you already have the self-awareness as a Master? Do you not want me talking to Saber?"[lr]::
32926::$$$message_0265_0013_0001$$$::"T-that's not it! It's just that if what you're saying is true, then Saber is a hero from the past, right? She wouldn't know how to get around in this day and age.[lr]::
32927::$$$message_0265_0013_0002$$$::That's why[line2]"::
32928::$$$message_0265_0014_0000$$$::"Shirou, that is incorrect. As long as it is the human world, I can adjust to any era. I am already familiar with this time period."[lr]::
32929::$$$message_0265_0014_0001$$$::"Wait... Really?"[lr]::
32930::$$$message_0265_0014_0002$$$::"Yes. This is also not the first time I have been summoned in this era."::
32931::$$$message_0265_0015_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
32932::$$$message_0265_0015_0001$$$::"No way, what are the chances...!?"[lr]::
32933::$$$message_0265_0015_0002$$$::Oh, Tohsaka is surprised, too.[lr]::
32934::$$$message_0265_0015_0003$$$::...So what Saber is saying must be truly incredible.::
32935::$$$message_0265_0016_0000$$$::"Shirou, I agree with her. You lack knowledge as a Master. As a Servant who made a contract with you, I need you to become stronger."[lr]::
32936::$$$message_0265_0016_0001$$$::Saber looks at me silently.[lr]::
32937::$$$message_0265_0016_0002$$$::...Her gaze was gentle, as if to say that she was worried not for herself, but for me.::
32938::$$$message_0265_0017_0000$$$::"...All right. I'll go, then.[lr]::
32939::$$$message_0265_0017_0001$$$::So, where is that place, Tohsaka? It's somewhere close enough where we can get back, right?"[lr]::
32940::$$$message_0265_0017_0002$$$::"Of course. The destination is Kotomine's church in Shinto. That's where the fake priest who is overseeing this battle is located."::
32941::$$$message_0265_0018_0000$$$::Tohsaka makes a devious smile.[lr]::
32942::$$$message_0265_0018_0001$$$::It looks like she's having fun having me wrapped around her finger.[lr]::
32943::$$$message_0265_0018_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
32944::$$$message_0265_0018_0003$$$::Call me crazy, but...[lr]::
32945::$$$message_0265_0018_0004$$$::I feel like something is wrong with her personality...::
32946::$$$message_0265_0019_0000$$$::We make our way through town at night.[lr]::
32947::$$$message_0265_0019_0001$$$::It's past 1 AM in the morning and there is absolutely nobody out.[lr]::
32948::$$$message_0265_0019_0002$$$::The lights from the houses are off, leaving only the street lights to illuminate the quiet town.::
32949::$$$message_0265_0020_0000$$$::"Hey, Tohsaka. This may be a silly question, but are you planning on walking the entire way?"[lr]::
32950::$$$message_0265_0020_0001$$$::"Yeah. The trains and buses have stopped running. A nighttime walk is good every now and then, no?"[lr]::
32951::$$$message_0265_0020_0002$$$::"I see. Just wondering, but do you know how long it takes to get there?"[lr]::
32952::$$$message_0265_0020_0003$$$::"Let's see, it should take an hour by foot. Well, if it gets late, we can always take a taxi."::
32953::$$$message_0265_0021_0000$$$::"I'm not gonna waste that kind of money. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that it's dangerous for a girl to be out at night. You know how it's been recently. If something happens, I may not be able to do anything about it."[lr]::
32954::$$$message_0265_0021_0001$$$::"Don't worry, no one's gonna mess with us. You seem to have forgotten, but Saber is really strong."::
32955::$$$message_0265_0022_0000$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
32956::$$$message_0265_0022_0001$$$::That's right.[lr]::
32957::$$$message_0265_0022_0002$$$::Even if someone at random attacked us, they wouldn't know what hit them in return.::
32958::$$$message_0265_0023_0000$$$::"Rin, what did Shirou mean? I could not understand."[lr]::
32959::$$$message_0265_0023_0001$$$::"Huh? Eh, it's nothing, he's just being stupid. He was suggesting if some pervert or something showed up he'd step in."::
32960::$$$message_0265_0024_0000$$$::"What? Shirou is my Master. It should be the other way around."[lr]::
32961::$$$message_0265_0024_0001$$$::"He isn't thinking about that sort of thing. Like he doesn't care about mages or Servants or anything. There's definitely some screws loose in there."[lr]::
32962::$$$message_0265_0024_0002$$$::"..."::
32963::$$$message_0265_0025_0000$$$::Tohsaka and Saber seem to now know each other well enough to talk to one another.[lr]::
32964::$$$message_0265_0025_0001$$$::Saber has been quiet ever since I stopped her from going out dressed as-is.::
32965::$$$message_0265_0026_0000$$$::She became even more silent ever since I made her wear a rain coat, since she refused to take off her armor.[lr]::
32966::$$$message_0265_0026_0001$$$::Now she's following behind me and only talking with Tohsaka.::
32967::$$$message_0265_0027_0000$$$::"Wait, where are you going, Emiya? Isn't that the wrong way?"[lr]::
32968::$$$message_0265_0027_0001$$$::"We just have to get to the bridge, right? It's faster this way."[lr]::
32969::$$$message_0265_0027_0002$$$::It feels awkward walking all bunched up together, so I quickly made my way to the side street ahead.[lr]::
32970::$$$message_0265_0027_0003$$$::They're both following me without complaint.::
32971::$$$message_0265_0028_0000$$$::We come out to a park by the riverside.[lr]::
32972::$$$message_0265_0028_0001$$$::We have to cross that bridge to go to the neighboring town, Shinto, but...::
32973::$$$message_0265_0029_0000$$$::"Huh, I didn't know there was a path here. I see... So since we can also get to the bridge from the park, we can just head for the park."[lr]::
32974::$$$message_0265_0029_0001$$$::Tohsaka's voice is full of energy as she looks up at the bridge.::
32975::$$$message_0265_0030_0000$$$::Maybe it's just because we're at a park at night.[lr]::
32976::$$$message_0265_0030_0001$$$::Tohsaka's profile as she peers up at the bridge looks even more beautiful than when I see her at school. I've sure got it bad.::
32977::$$$message_0265_0031_0000$$$::"Let's go. We didn't come here to play around."[lr]::
32978::$$$message_0265_0031_0001$$$::I hurry her along and lead her to the stairs.[lr]::
32979::$$$message_0265_0031_0002$$$::If we take the walkway next to the bridge, then we can get straight to Shinto.::
32980::$$$message_0265_0032_0000$$$::Nobody's on the bridge.[lr]::
32981::$$$message_0265_0032_0001$$$::It's not particularly busy even during the day though, so it's to be expected.[lr]::
32982::$$$message_0265_0032_0002$$$::People usually commute by bus or train, so foot traffic is pretty rare.::
32983::$$$message_0265_0033_0000$$$::It's long enough and seems unsupported such that there's probably a fear of collapse that plays into that.[lr]::
32984::$$$message_0265_0033_0001$$$::I'd guess that's why nobody uses it even on dates, despite being the perfect view.::
32985::$$$message_0265_0034_0000$$$::"...That's stupid. What am I thinking?"[lr]::
32986::$$$message_0265_0034_0001$$$::Tohsaka keeps next to me while Saber follows behind us silently.[lr]::
32987::$$$message_0265_0034_0002$$$::I try to ignore them as I hurry across the bridge.::
32988::$$$message_0265_0035_0000$$$::After crossing the bridge, Tohsaka guides us into the suburbs.[lr]::
32989::$$$message_0265_0035_0001$$$::When I think of Shinto, what comes to mind is the always-under construction office buildings. But beyond the station, the streets of yesteryear remain.::
32990::$$$message_0265_0036_0000$$$::Within that, the suburbs are the oldest of them all.[lr]::
32991::$$$message_0265_0036_0001$$$::There are gradual slopes and a view overlooking the ocean.[lr]::
32992::$$$message_0265_0036_0002$$$::As we go farther up the hill, there are fewer and fewer buildings, and the foreigner cemetery built on the slope comes into view.::
32993::$$$message_0265_0037_0000$$$::"The church is up here. You must have been here at least once, right?"[lr]::
32994::$$$message_0265_0037_0001$$$::"No, I haven't. I know that it used to be an orphanage, though."[lr]::
32995::$$$message_0265_0037_0002$$$::"I see, it'll be your first time here. In that case, you should brace yourself a bit. The priest here is real difficult."::
32996::$$$message_0265_0038_0000$$$::Tohsaka starts up the hill.[lr]::
32997::$$$message_0265_0038_0001$$$::...I look up and see what looks like a cross cresting the hill.[lr]::
32998::$$$message_0265_0038_0002$$$::A church atop a hill.[lr]::
32999::$$$message_0265_0038_0003$$$::I never thought I would end up visiting God's house for the first time over something like this.::
33000::$$$message_0265_0039_0000$$$::"Woah, this is amazing."[lr]::
33001::$$$message_0265_0039_0001$$$::The church is rather impressive.[lr]::
33002::$$$message_0265_0039_0002$$$::The grounds seems to cover most of the hilltop, as I am welcomed by a flat and open space.[lr]::
33003::$$$message_0265_0039_0003$$$::The church itself is not particularly big, but it is overpowering in the way it seems to tower over visitors.::
33004::$$$message_0265_0040_0000$$$::"Shirou, I will stay here."[lr]::
33005::$$$message_0265_0040_0001$$$::"Huh? Why? I can't just leave you here after coming all this way."::
33006::$$$message_0265_0041_0000$$$::"I did not come for anything from the church. I came to protect you. If this is your destination, then I trust you will not stray far. I shall wait here for your return."[lr]::
33007::$$$message_0265_0041_0001$$$::Saber says clearly.[lr]::
33008::$$$message_0265_0041_0002$$$::It doesn't seem like she's going to budge on this, so I'll just have to respect her decision.::
33009::$$$message_0265_0042_0000$$$::"All right. I'll be right back."[lr]::
33010::$$$message_0265_0042_0001$$$::"Yes. But please be on guard no matter who it is, Master."::
33011::$$$message_0265_0043_0000$$$::It is a spacious, solemn chapel.[lr]::
33012::$$$message_0265_0043_0001$$$::With this many seats, there must be quite a few attendees during service.[lr]::
33013::$$$message_0265_0043_0002$$$::The priest must be distinguished to be entrusted with a church like this.::
33014::$$$message_0265_0044_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, what kind of person is the priest here?"[lr]::
33015::$$$message_0265_0044_0001$$$::"That's hard to explain. I've known him for about a decade, but I still don't quite get him."[lr]::
33016::$$$message_0265_0044_0002$$$::"You've known him ten years...? That's quite a long relationship. Is he a relative of yours or something?"::
33017::$$$message_0265_0045_0000$$$::"Not a relative, but my guardian. Not to mention he's also my senior as an apprentice and second instructor."[lr]::
33018::$$$message_0265_0045_0001$$$::"Huh... Senior apprentice, you mean as a mage!?"::
33019::$$$message_0265_0046_0000$$$::"Yeah. Why are you so surprised?"[lr]::
33020::$$$message_0265_0046_0001$$$::"But he's a priest right!? It's a taboo for a priest to be using magecraft!"[lr]::
33021::$$$message_0265_0046_0002$$$::Mages and the Church should be mutually exclusive.::
33022::$$$message_0265_0047_0000$$$::The large organization that mages belong to is called the Mage's Association,[lr]::
33023::$$$message_0265_0047_0001$$$::and behind the world's largest religion, the side of Christianity that you wouldn't see if you're living a normal life, is an organization that is ostensibly called the Holy Church.[lr]::
33024::$$$message_0265_0047_0002$$$::These two seem similar yet different. They cooperate together on the surface, but they have a dangerous relationship where they're always trying to kill each other when given the chance.::
33025::$$$message_0265_0048_0000$$$::The Church hates heretics.[lr]::
33026::$$$message_0265_0048_0001$$$::They eliminate the inhuman, which includes those who use magecraft.[lr]::
33027::$$$message_0265_0048_0002$$$::For the Church, miracles are only granted to and utilized by saints.[lr]::
33028::$$$message_0265_0048_0003$$$::Any others who perform miracles are all heretics.::
33029::$$$message_0265_0049_0000$$$::There are no exceptions, whether they belong to the Church or not.[lr]::
33030::$$$message_0265_0049_0001$$$::Also, the higher the position, the more forbidden it is to use the impurity of magecraft.  [lr]::
33031::$$$message_0265_0049_0002$$$::It goes without saying that for a true believer, the stronger the divine protection, the farther one stays away from magecraft, but...::
33032::$$$message_0265_0050_0000$$$::"...First of all, is the priest one of your kind?"[lr]::
33033::$$$message_0265_0050_0001$$$::"Yes. He's the Overseer of the Holy Grail War, after all; an active Executor dispatched by the Church. Well, it's questionable whether he has divine protection or not, though."::
33034::$$$message_0265_0051_0000$$$::Tohsaka walks towards the altar.[lr]::
33035::$$$message_0265_0051_0001$$$::It's bad manners to do that without the priest present, but it's so late at night. [lr]::
33036::$$$message_0265_0051_0002$$$::I can't imagine he'd be in the chapel. If he's anywhere it'd be somewhere in the back.::
33037::$$$message_0265_0052_0000$$$::"...Hm. So, what is that priest's name? You were saying something like Kotomine before."[lr]::
33038::$$$message_0265_0052_0001$$$::I ask, following after her.[lr]::
33039::$$$message_0265_0052_0002$$$::She comes to stand before the altar and turns to me with a conflicted expression.::
33040::$$$message_0265_0053_0000$$$::"His name is Kirei Kotomine. He was my father's student, and I suppose he's been an important person in my life. But, well, if I had a choice, I'd have never met him."[lr]::
33041::$$$message_0265_0053_0001$$$::"I feel the same way. I would not have wanted an apprentice who does not respect her instructor."::
33042::$$$message_0265_0054_0000$$$::I hear footsteps.[lr]::
33043::$$$message_0265_0054_0001$$$::He appears from somewhere behind the altar, slowly making his way over. He must have heard us come in.::
33044::$$$message_0265_0055_0000$$$::"You didn't answer my repeated calls, and now you've brought a strange guest. Hmm, so he's the seventh one, Rin?"::
33045::$$$message_0265_0056_0000$$$::"Yes. He's a mage, but he's a complete amateur, so I couldn't leave him be.[lr]::
33046::$$$message_0265_0056_0001$$$::...I believe that the rule was to report here when one becomes a Master, right? You guys made that all up, but in this case I'll play along."::
33047::$$$message_0265_0057_0000$$$::"That is sufficient. I see, I must be thanking this young man."[lr]::
33048::$$$message_0265_0057_0001$$$::The priest called Kotomine slowly turns to me.::
33049::$$$message_0265_0058_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33050::$$$message_0265_0058_0001$$$::...Without realizing, I take a step back.[lr]::
33051::$$$message_0265_0058_0002$$$::...There's no reason for me to be scared.[lr]::
33052::$$$message_0265_0058_0003$$$::...It's not like feel any hostility from this man, either.[lr]::
33053::$$$message_0265_0058_0004$$$::Yet, he still had this intimidating presence that makes it feel like lead weights were just heaved onto my shoulders.::
33054::$$$message_0265_0059_0000$$$::"My name is Kirei Kotomine, the one who is in charge of this church.[lr]::
33055::$$$message_0265_0059_0001$$$::What is your name, seventh Master?"[lr]::
33056::$$$message_0265_0059_0002$$$::"...Shirou Emiya. Though I haven't agreed to this 'Master' thing yet."[lr]::
33057::$$$message_0265_0059_0003$$$::I glare at the priest, trying to match his intensity.::
33058::$$$message_0265_0060_0000$$$::"Shirou...Emiya."[lr]::
33059::$$$message_0265_0060_0001$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
33060::$$$message_0265_0060_0002$$$::The weight I'm feeling changes to a chill.[lr]::
33061::$$$message_0265_0060_0003$$$::The priest smiles silently, as if he's come across something pleasant.[lr]::
33062::$$$message_0265_0060_0004$$$::    That smile...[lr]::
33063::$$$message_0265_0060_0005$$$::I can't think of anything that would compare[line2]::
33064::$$$message_0265_0061_0000$$$::"Thank you for bringing Rin here, Emiya. If it were not for you, she would have never come."[lr]::
33065::$$$message_0265_0061_0001$$$::The priest walks towards the altar.[lr]::
33066::$$$message_0265_0061_0002$$$::Tohsaka steps away from the altar with a bored expression and moves to stand next to me.::
33067::$$$message_0265_0062_0000$$$::"Let us begin, then. Shirou Emiya, you are Saber's Master, correct?"[lr]::
33068::$$$message_0265_0062_0001$$$::"That's wrong. Yes, I made a contract with Saber. But I don't know anything about Masters or the Holy Grail War or anything.[lr]::
33069::$$$message_0265_0062_0002$$$::If Masters are supposed to be established mages, then you should choose another Master."::
33070::$$$message_0265_0063_0000$$$::"...I see, this is serious. Does he really not know anything, Rin?"[lr]::
33071::$$$message_0265_0063_0001$$$::"I told you he's an amateur. Teach him right from step one. You're good at that, right?"[lr]::
33072::$$$message_0265_0063_0002$$$::Tohsaka urges the priest unenthusiastically.::
33073::$$$message_0265_0064_0000$$$::"Ah. I see, I see. So, that's what this is all about.[lr]::
33074::$$$message_0265_0064_0001$$$::Very well. This is the first time you've so willingly come to me."[lr]::
33075::$$$message_0265_0064_0002$$$::I can't thank you enough, Shirou Emiya."[lr]::
33076::$$$message_0265_0064_0003$$$::Father Kotomine laughs.[lr]::
33077::$$$message_0265_0064_0004$$$::Their conversation is making me uneasy.::
33078::$$$message_0265_0065_0000$$$::"First of all, let me correct your misunderstandings.[lr]::
33079::$$$message_0265_0065_0001$$$::You see, Shirou Emiya, the role of the Master is not something that you can give to another person, nor is it something that you can forfeit once you have been chosen.[lr]::
33080::$$$message_0265_0065_0002$$$::No matter who they are, those who have a Command Spell on their arm cannot quit. You must first accept that fact."::
33081::$$$message_0265_0066_0000$$$::"...Why can't I quit?"[lr]::
33082::$$$message_0265_0066_0001$$$::"Command Spells are sacred marks. Being a Master is a trial blessed to you. It's not something that you can give up just because it is inconvenient.[lr]::
33083::$$$message_0265_0066_0002$$$::You won't be liberated from that pain until you get the Holy Grail."::
33084::$$$message_0265_0067_0000$$$::"If you wish to retire from being Master, then you have no other choice but to win the Holy Grail and fulfill your wish. If that happens, then everything will go back to normal, Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
33085::$$$message_0265_0067_0001$$$::Your every desire, even the cleansing of your soul from the filth of this world, is possible... That's right, one could start everything over from the beginning."::
33086::$$$message_0265_0068_0000$$$::As such, you should find your wish.[lr]::
33087::$$$message_0265_0068_0001$$$::If that time comes, you will be thankful for the luck that made you a Master. If you want to erase the unseen that has scorched your heart, all you have to do is accept the holy mark."::
33088::$$$message_0265_0069_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
33089::$$$message_0265_0069_0001$$$::I feel dizzy.[lr]::
33090::$$$message_0265_0069_0002$$$::The priest's words don't make any sense.[lr]::
33091::$$$message_0265_0069_0003$$$::The more I hear, the more I get confused.[lr]::
33092::$$$message_0265_0069_0004$$$::...But still, his words seem to soak into my chest and clot like blood...::
33093::$$$message_0265_0070_0000$$$::"Kirei, don't go off topic. I asked you to explain the rules to him. No one asked for you to open old wounds."[lr]::
33094::$$$message_0265_0070_0001$$$::A voice interrupts the priest's words.[lr]::
33095::$$$message_0265_0070_0002$$$::"...T-Tohsaka?"[lr]::
33096::$$$message_0265_0070_0003$$$::That clears my head.::
33097::$$$message_0265_0071_0000$$$::"I see. It may be pointless to explain such things to this kind of person, but I thought I could still clear his conscience of moral compunctions while he still misunderstood.[lr]::
33098::$$$message_0265_0071_0001$$$::...Hmm, perhaps it is true that such pity is unbecoming. My apologies, it seems I am enjoying myself too much."[lr]::
33099::$$$message_0265_0071_0002$$$::"What, does it do any good for you to help him?"::
33100::$$$message_0265_0072_0000$$$::"Absolutely. Helping others leads to one's own salvation. Though, I suppose at this point there is no reason to try and explain it to you.[lr]::
33101::$$$message_0265_0072_0001$$$::Back to the original topic, Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
33102::$$$message_0265_0072_0002$$$::The battle that you have been dragged into is called the 'Holy Grail War.'[lr]::
33103::$$$message_0265_0072_0003$$$::Have you heard from Rin already that this is a free-for-all between seven Masters using seven Servants?"::
33104::$$$message_0265_0073_0000$$$::"...I heard. Seven Masters killing each other is ridiculous."[lr]::
33105::$$$message_0265_0073_0001$$$::"Indeed. However, we do not wish such atrocities to be carried out.[lr]::
33106::$$$message_0265_0073_0002$$$::It is all a ritual to determine who is the most suitable to receive the Holy Grail.[lr]::
33107::$$$message_0265_0073_0003$$$::Due to its importance, it is necessary to conduct several trials to determine the owner."::
33108::$$$message_0265_0074_0000$$$::...Trials my ass.[lr]::
33109::$$$message_0265_0074_0001$$$::If I squint I might be able to see it like that, but for sure this priest doesn't think of it as a trial.::
33110::$$$message_0265_0075_0000$$$::"Hold on. You've been repeating 'Holy Grail' over and over again, but what even is that? You can't possibly mean that it's actually [font italic=true]that[font italic=false] Holy Grail, right?"::
33111::$$$message_0265_0076_0000$$$::The Holy Grail.[lr]::
33112::$$$message_0265_0076_0001$$$::A chalice that is said to have received the blood of Christ.[lr]::
33113::$$$message_0265_0076_0002$$$::It's considered to be one of the most sacred of relics and is said to be capable of many miracles.::
33114::$$$message_0265_0077_0000$$$::The most well known legend is that the one who obtains the Holy Grail will obtain the world.[lr]::
33115::$$$message_0265_0077_0001$$$::...But that's just a myth. It's something that exists mostly in theory or belief, but not in actual practice.::
33116::$$$message_0265_0078_0000$$$::It is true that an object called the Holy Grail, which makes wishes come true, appears in legends and folklore all over the world.[lr]::
33117::$$$message_0265_0078_0001$$$::But that's the extent of it.[lr]::
33118::$$$message_0265_0078_0002$$$::Even if it did exist, the Holy Grail is an imaginary power impossible to replicate.::
33119::$$$message_0265_0079_0000$$$::"So answer me, Kirei Kotomine. Is the Holy Grail that you talk about the real deal?"[lr]::
33120::$$$message_0265_0079_0001$$$::"Of course. The Holy Grail that manifests in this town is real. As proof, miracles that cannot be explained by logic, such as Servants, have occurred.::
33121::$$$message_0265_0080_0000$$$::Summoning Heroic Spirits from the past for use in battle. No, this miracle, infinitesimally close to resurrection, can be called True Magic.[lr]::
33122::$$$message_0265_0080_0001$$$::The Holy Grail holds such dominion and grants its bearer infinite power. Things like the authenticity of the object are worthless before that truth."::
33123::$$$message_0265_0081_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33124::$$$message_0265_0081_0001$$$::In other words...[lr]::
33125::$$$message_0265_0081_0002$$$::He means that even if it's a fake, the authenticity of it would not be questioned if it has more power than the real thing.::
33126::$$$message_0265_0082_0000$$$::"...All right. Let's assume there really is a Holy Grail. Why does there have to be a Holy Grail War? If there's a grail, they don't have to kill each other. If it's something so great, everyone can share it."[lr]::
33127::$$$message_0265_0082_0001$$$::"That is a valid stance, but we do not have such freedom.[lr]::
33128::$$$message_0265_0082_0002$$$::There can only be one that can obtain the Holy Grail.[lr]::
33129::$$$message_0265_0082_0003$$$::It is not something that we decided, but what the Holy Grail decided."::
33130::$$$message_0265_0083_0000$$$::"Choosing the seven Masters and summoning the seven Servants are all things that the Holy Grail does.[lr]::
33131::$$$message_0265_0083_0001$$$::I told you that this is a ritual. The Holy Grail designates those that are suitable to receive it and selects only one person to be the owner by making them fight for it.[lr]::
33132::$$$message_0265_0083_0002$$$::That is the Holy Grail War. A ritual of spiritual evocation where those chosen by the grail slay one another to obtain it."::
33133::$$$message_0265_0084_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33134::$$$message_0265_0084_0001$$$::The priest says it all matter-of-factly.[lr]::
33135::$$$message_0265_0084_0002$$$::I find myself without an argument as I look down at my left hand.[lr]::
33136::$$$message_0265_0084_0003$$$::...There is the mark that they call the Command Spell.[lr]::
33137::$$$message_0265_0084_0004$$$::The priest is trying to say that as long as I have this mark, I can't quit being a Master.::
33138::$$$message_0265_0085_0000$$$::"...I'm not convinced. Even if you can only choose one person, I don't like the idea of having to kill the other Masters."[lr]::
33139::$$$message_0265_0085_0001$$$::"Huh? Hold on. You misunderstand. There's no need to kill the other Masters."[lr]::
33140::$$$message_0265_0085_0002$$$::Tohsaka taps on my shoulder and blows the argument wide open again.::
33141::$$$message_0265_0086_0000$$$::"What? But you said we have to kill each other. Kotomine said so too."[lr]::
33142::$$$message_0265_0086_0001$$$::"You do have to kill each other."[lr]::
33143::$$$message_0265_0086_0002$$$::"You be quiet, Kirei. Look, the Holy Grail in this town is in spirit form. Since it doesn't exist physically yet, you have to summon it. That's the ritual: we're materializing it."::
33144::$$$message_0265_0087_0000$$$::"So mages can summon the grail, but since it's in spirit form, we can't touch it. Do you understand what this means?"[lr]::
33145::$$$message_0265_0087_0001$$$::"I understand. Only spirits can touch other spirits, right?"[lr]::
33146::$$$message_0265_0087_0002$$$::...Oh, that's why we need Servants!"::
33147::$$$message_0265_0088_0000$$$::"Exactly. The Holy Grail War is something where you eliminate all the other Servants other than your own. So there's no rule saying that you must kill the Masters."::
33148::$$$message_0265_0089_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33149::$$$message_0265_0089_0001$$$::Man, she could've told me that sooner![lr]::
33150::$$$message_0265_0089_0002$$$::Geez, Tohsaka and this priest sure love torturing people.[lr]::
33151::$$$message_0265_0089_0003$$$::...Anyways, that's a relief.[lr]::
33152::$$$message_0265_0089_0004$$$::So even if I participate in the Holy Grail War, Tohsaka's not going to die.::
33153::$$$message_0265_0090_0000$$$::"I see, I suppose that is another way to consider it.[lr]::
33154::$$$message_0265_0090_0001$$$::Then let me ask you, Shirou Emiya. Do you think you can defeat your own Servant?"::
33155::$$$message_0265_0091_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
33156::$$$message_0265_0091_0001$$$::Defeat Saber?[lr]::
33157::$$$message_0265_0091_0002$$$::That's impossible.[lr]::
33158::$$$message_0265_0091_0003$$$::Magecraft doesn't work on her, and she's an incredibly powerful swordswoman.::
33159::$$$message_0265_0092_0000$$$::"Then let me pose something else. It is absurd, but I must ask: do you think you are superior to your Servant?"[lr]::
33160::$$$message_0265_0092_0001$$$::"?"[lr]::
33161::$$$message_0265_0092_0002$$$::What is this guy saying?[lr]::
33162::$$$message_0265_0092_0003$$$::I can't defeat Saber, so there's no way that I can be superior to her.[lr]::
33163::$$$message_0265_0092_0004$$$::No matter how you phrase it, the answer is still that I'm weaker than my Serva[line2]::
33164::$$$message_0265_0093_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
33165::$$$message_0265_0093_0001$$$::"That is right. Servants are hard to defeat even with another Servant. Then, what would you do?[lr]::
33166::$$$message_0265_0093_0002$$$::See, it's a simple solution. Servants cannot exist without their Master. No matter how powerful the Servant may be, they will cease to exist if their Master is defeated. If so..."::
33167::$$$message_0265_0094_0000$$$::Yeah, it's a natural solution.[lr]::
33168::$$$message_0265_0094_0001$$$::You wouldn't pick the hard route.[lr]::
33169::$$$message_0265_0094_0002$$$::In order to win, the most effective way to kill the Servant would be to kill the Master, not the Servant...::
33170::$$$message_0265_0095_0000$$$::"...Okay, I understand that in order to eliminate the Servant, defeating the Master is faster.[lr]::
33171::$$$message_0265_0095_0001$$$::But then, if a Servant is defeated first, would their Master not be a Master anymore? Only Servants can touch the Holy Grail, right? Then, Masters who lost their Servant wouldn't have any worth anymore."::
33172::$$$message_0265_0096_0000$$$::"No, as long as they have Command Spells, their rights as a Master and the ability to form a contract remains. As long as they have the mark, they're free to contract with any other Servant."::
33173::$$$message_0265_0097_0000$$$::"A Servant who loses their Master does not necessarily disappear right away. They stay in this world until all of the magical energy in their body runs out. If they meet a Master who is bereft of a Servant, they can form another contract, and make a return to the battlefield.[lr]::
33174::$$$message_0265_0097_0001$$$::That is why Masters kill other Masters. If you allow them to live, there is a possibility they become a future hindrance."::
33175::$$$message_0265_0098_0000$$$::"...Then what if you use up your Command Spells? Then you can't form a contract with other Servants, and freed Servants can go off with other Masters too."[lr]::
33176::$$$message_0265_0098_0001$$$::"Wait, that's..."[lr]::
33177::$$$message_0265_0098_0002$$$::"Yes, that is correct. If you use up your Command Spells, then you will be liberated from all duties as a Master."::
33178::$$$message_0265_0099_0000$$$::"...Although, I cannot imagine that there would be mage that would waste a Command Spell that allows them to use such powerful magecraft.[lr]::
33179::$$$message_0265_0099_0001$$$::If there was, they would be an amateur or a coward."[lr]::
33180::$$$message_0265_0099_0002$$$::The priest laughs, as if he can see right through me.::
33181::$$$message_0265_0100_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
33182::$$$message_0265_0100_0001$$$::He's getting on my nerves.[lr]::
33183::$$$message_0265_0100_0002$$$::That priest is making fun of me. He clearly wants to get a rise out of me.::
33184::$$$message_0265_0101_0000$$$::"Is everything clear? If so, I have finished covering the rules.[lr]::
33185::$$$message_0265_0101_0001$$$::Now, let us return to the beginning, Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
33186::$$$message_0265_0101_0002$$$::You said you have no intention of being Master, but is that still true?" ::
33187::$$$message_0265_0102_0000$$$::"If you wish to quit, then so be it.[lr]::
33188::$$$message_0265_0102_0001$$$::As you have said, you may use up your Command Spells and terminate your contract with Saber. I would then guarantee your safety until the Holy Grail War ends."::
33189::$$$message_0265_0103_0000$$$::"Huh? Wait, why do you have to guarantee my safety? I can protect myself."[lr]::
33190::$$$message_0265_0103_0001$$$::"I do not have the luxury of time to care for you either, but this is also a rule.[lr]::
33191::$$$message_0265_0103_0002$$$::My orders are to supervise this occurrence of the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
33192::$$$message_0265_0103_0003$$$::It is part of my duty to keep the casualties from the Holy Grail War to a minimum.[lr]::
33193::$$$message_0265_0103_0004$$$::Protecting mages who are no longer Masters are my top priority as Overseer."::
33194::$$$message_0265_0104_0000$$$::"'This occurrence of the Holy Grail War'...?"[lr]::
33195::$$$message_0265_0104_0001$$$::Hold on.[lr]::
33196::$$$message_0265_0104_0002$$$::That means...this has happened more than once?::
33197::$$$message_0265_0105_0000$$$::"What do you mean? The Holy Grail War didn't just start now?"::
33198::$$$message_0265_0106_0000$$$::"Of course not. Do you believe that an overseer would be dispatched if so?[lr]::
33199::$$$message_0265_0106_0001$$$::It is the duty of this church to recover holy relics, as we are part of the lowest-ranked special agencies. Originally, our purpose was to research and recover the True Cross, but here, our duty is to assess the Holy Grail.[lr]::
33200::$$$message_0265_0106_0002$$$::We are to investigate the 726th Holy Grail that has been observed in this far eastern land. We must recover it if it is real, and invalidate it if it is not."::
33201::$$$message_0265_0107_0000$$$::"726th... That many Holy Grails?"[lr]::
33202::$$$message_0265_0107_0001$$$::"Who knows? Insofar we understand, there are at least so many similar objects."::
33203::$$$message_0265_0108_0000$$$::"And one of those is the grail from the Holy Grail War observed in this town.[lr]::
33204::$$$message_0265_0108_0001$$$::According to our records, it is said that the first battle was two hundred years ago.[lr]::
33205::$$$message_0265_0108_0002$$$::Since then, the battle among the Masters have been repeating in a cycle of fifty years.[lr]::
33206::$$$message_0265_0108_0003$$$::This is the fifth time for this Holy Grail War. Since the last one was ten years ago, this has been the shortest cycle yet."::
33207::$$$message_0265_0109_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]Are you guys insane? You've had this kind of thing happen four times already...!?"[lr]::
33208::$$$message_0265_0109_0001$$$::"I couldn't agree more. Just as you say, this has happened far too many times already.[lr]::
33209::$$$message_0265_0109_0002$$$::Yes.[lr]::
33210::$$$message_0265_0109_0003$$$::In the past, the Holy Grail Wars have all been brutal, fatally. The Masters were driven by their desires, forgetting what they had been taught as mages, and murdered one another wholesale."::
33211::$$$message_0265_0110_0000$$$::"I am sure that you are aware, the worst crime for mages is to use magecraft in public. Mages are not supposed to reveal their identity to the public.[lr]::
33212::$$$message_0265_0110_0001$$$::However, past Masters have violated that.[lr]::
33213::$$$message_0265_0110_0002$$$::The Mage's Association dispatched third party overseers to maintain order, but they only started from the third Holy Grail War. The one who was dispatched that time was my father. Do you understand, boy?"::
33214::$$$message_0265_0111_0000$$$::"...Yeah, I get why these overseers are necessary.[lr]::
33215::$$$message_0265_0111_0001$$$::But based on what you said just now, these Holy Grail Wars are just evil at their core.[lr]::
33216::$$$message_0265_0111_0002$$$::"Oh? How are they so evil?"::
33217::$$$message_0265_0112_0000$$$::"The past Masters were mages who would break the rules, right?[lr]::
33218::$$$message_0265_0112_0001$$$::Okay, so assuming the Holy Grail is real. What if the one who wins is selfish and would only use it for their own interests? It would be bad if it was given to someone who has no problem killing others.[lr]::
33219::$$$message_0265_0112_0002$$$::If the Mage's Association is responsible for mages, shouldn't you be punishing those kinds of people?"::
33220::$$$message_0265_0113_0000$$$::I ask, with a glimmer of hope.[lr]::
33221::$$$message_0265_0113_0001$$$::However, as expected, Kirei Kotomine laughs.::
33222::$$$message_0265_0114_0000$$$::"Of course not. There are no mages that don't act out of self-interest. The only thing we administer are the rules of the war. The aftermath does not interest us. And the Association is not concerned with what kind of individual obtains the grail."[lr]::
33223::$$$message_0265_0114_0001$$$::"That's crazy! What if the Master who gets the grail is a psychopath!?"::
33224::$$$message_0265_0115_0000$$$::"Certainly a bother, but there is nothing that we can do. It is the Holy Grail that chooses its owner. And we do not have the power to stop the Master chosen by the grail.[lr]::
33225::$$$message_0265_0115_0001$$$::It is a grail that makes wishes come true. The one who obtains it will be able to do as they please.[lr]::
33226::$$$message_0265_0115_0002$$$::But if you do not want such a thing to come to pass, then you must win it yourself. That is the more reliable way, isn't it?"::
33227::$$$message_0265_0116_0000$$$::Kotomine is trying to hold back his laughter.[lr]::
33228::$$$message_0265_0116_0001$$$::He seems to enjoy how I'm not able to accept being Master.::
33229::$$$message_0265_0117_0000$$$::"What happened, boy? I thought that was a good plan, but you don't seem too keen on the idea."[lr]::
33230::$$$message_0265_0117_0001$$$::"...That's not your concern. First off, I have no reason to fight. I'm not interested in the Holy Grail, and I don't feel like a Master even if you call me one."::
33231::$$$message_0265_0118_0000$$$::"Oh. So you are not interested in what the victor of the grail would do, even if it leads to disaster?"::
33232::$$$message_0265_0119_0000$$$::"That's..."[lr]::
33233::$$$message_0265_0119_0001$$$::...I don't have anything to say.[lr]::
33234::$$$message_0265_0119_0002$$$::Damn it, everything this guy says is like a beatdown.[lr]::
33235::$$$message_0265_0119_0003$$$::He just delivers blow after blow of the harsh truth and doesn't let up at all.::
33236::$$$message_0265_0120_0000$$$::"If you don't have a reason to fight, that's fine. I suppose that means you do not care about what happened ten years ago?"[lr]::
33237::$$$message_0265_0120_0001$$$::"...Ten years ago...?"::
33238::$$$message_0265_0121_0000$$$::"Correct. At the end of the last Holy Grail War, an unworthy Master touched the grail. I do not know what that Master wished for. What we do know are the results of that disaster."[lr]::
33239::$$$message_0265_0121_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
33240::$$$message_0265_0122_0000$$$::                             For one moment...[lr]::
33241::$$$message_0265_0122_0001$$$::                             That hell appeared in the back of my mind.::
33242::$$$message_0265_0123_0000$$$::"Hold on. That can't be..."[lr]::
33243::$$$message_0265_0123_0001$$$::"It is. The tragedy that everyone living in Fuyuki is well aware of, Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
33244::$$$message_0265_0123_0002$$$::Five hundred casualties, a hundred and thirty-four buildings destroyed. That fire is what remains of the previous Holy Grail War."::
33245::$$$message_0265_0124_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33246::$$$message_0265_0124_0001$$$::    I feel nauseous.[lr]::
33247::$$$message_0265_0124_0002$$$::My vision blurs.[lr]::
33248::$$$message_0265_0124_0003$$$::I can't focus anymore.[lr]::
33249::$$$message_0265_0124_0004$$$::It feels like I'm going to pass out.::
33250::$$$message_0265_0125_0000$$$::I force myself to stand firm before I completely lose control.[lr]::
33251::$$$message_0265_0125_0001$$$::My teeth clench as I stave off oblivion.[lr]::
33252::$$$message_0265_0125_0002$$$::Anger boils over within me and I use that to fight against the rising nausea.::
33253::$$$message_0265_0126_0000$$$::"Emiya? What wrong? You're all pale. I know this is all a lot to take in, but you know[line2]Look, why don't you get some air?"::
33254::$$$message_0265_0127_0000$$$::I must've looked awfully pale.[lr]::
33255::$$$message_0265_0127_0001$$$::Though this must really be something else for Tohsaka to be that worried about me.::
33256::$$$message_0265_0128_0000$$$::"No need to worry. I feel better after seeing the funny face you're making."[lr]::
33257::$$$message_0265_0128_0001$$$::"...Hey. What is that supposed to mean?"[lr]::
33258::$$$message_0265_0128_0002$$$::"I don't mean anything by it. Literally just what I said, don't worry about it."::
33259::$$$message_0265_0129_0000$$$::"Well, fine... Hey. That's worse, lunkhead!"[lr]::
33260::$$$message_0265_0129_0001$$$::And with that, the supposed number one model student Rin Tohsaka smacks me upside the head.[lr]::
33261::$$$message_0265_0129_0002$$$::Which is just enough.[lr]::
33262::$$$message_0265_0129_0003$$$::The nausea and anger from earlier disappear altogether.::
33263::$$$message_0265_0130_0000$$$::"...Thanks. I'm serious, Tohsaka, it was a help. I still have a few things that I need to ask, though, so hold on to whatever else you have for a second."[lr]::
33264::$$$message_0265_0130_0001$$$::Tohsaka looks like she isn't through with me, but acquiesces. ::
33265::$$$message_0265_0131_0000$$$::"Oh, you still have questions? So be it, let us clear the air of any concerns."[lr]::
33266::$$$message_0265_0131_0001$$$::He ought to know what I'm gonna say, but he seems to enjoy needling me to say it aloud.[lr]::
33267::$$$message_0265_0131_0002$$$::Bring it on.[lr]::
33268::$$$message_0265_0131_0003$$$::I'm not gonna back down.::
33269::$$$message_0265_0132_0000$$$::"Then I'll ask. You said this is the fifth war, right? Then, has anyone ever actually obtained the grail?"[lr]::
33270::$$$message_0265_0132_0001$$$::"Of course. Such disasterous misfortune does not happen every time."[lr]::
33271::$$$message_0265_0132_0002$$$::"Then..."::
33272::$$$message_0265_0133_0000$$$::"Don't get ahead of yourself. It is easy to obtain it. After all, the Holy Grail itself is looked after by the Church. If you wish to touch it, you may do so any day of the week."[lr]::
33273::$$$message_0265_0133_0001$$$::"What...?"[lr]::
33274::$$$message_0265_0133_0002$$$::T-the Holy Grail is in this church...?::
33275::$$$message_0265_0134_0000$$$::"Of course, it is only the vessel. It has no contents. As Rin mentioned earlier, it is still in a spiritual state.[lr]::
33276::$$$message_0265_0134_0001$$$::The one stored here is an elaborate replica. This is used as a catalyst to materialize the real Holy Grail and form the chalice that can make wishes come true. I suppose it is similar to the relationship between Master and Servant. Yes...there was indeed a man who obtained the real article, at least temporarily."::
33277::$$$message_0265_0135_0000$$$::"So the grail was real? Wait, what happened to that guy who obtained it?"[lr]::
33278::$$$message_0265_0135_0001$$$::"Nothing happened. That Holy Grail did not come to completion. All due to the folly of one man's foolishness."::
33279::$$$message_0265_0136_0000$$$::...?[lr]::
33280::$$$message_0265_0136_0001$$$::I don't know where his high and mighty attitude went. Suddenly he casts his eyes down and looks regretful.::
33281::$$$message_0265_0137_0000$$$::"...What do you mean? Didn't the grail appear?"[lr]::
33282::$$$message_0265_0137_0001$$$::"If one is only concerned with making the grail appear, that is simple enough. Once the seven Servants are present, it will manifest in time. As Rin says, there is no need to kill the other Masters.[lr]::
33283::$$$message_0265_0137_0002$$$::However, that does not complete the Holy Grail. That thing chooses its own suitable owner. A man who avoided battle could not and did not obtain it."::
33284::$$$message_0265_0138_0000$$$::"Hmm. So you're saying it's pointless to obtain it without a clear conclusion to the battles with other Masters.[lr]::
33285::$$$message_0265_0138_0001$$$::Last time, the first Master to obtain the grail was spineless. He avoided the grail and said he didn't want to fight the other Masters."::
33286::$$$message_0265_0139_0000$$$::Tohsaka spits out, looking away from Kotomine.[lr]::
33287::$$$message_0265_0139_0001$$$::"...No way."[lr]::
33288::$$$message_0265_0139_0002$$$::So does that mean that Kotomine was one of the Masters in the last war, and he obtained the Holy Grail but refused to fight and retired...!?::
33289::$$$message_0265_0140_0000$$$::"...Kotomine. You didn't fight?"[lr]::
33290::$$$message_0265_0140_0001$$$::"I did up to the halfway point. But I made a mistake. This resulted in an incomplete Holy Grail.[lr]::
33291::$$$message_0265_0140_0002$$$::Well, that must have been my limit, regardless. The other Masters were all monstrously strong. I lost my Servant right away and was taken under my father's protection."::
33292::$$$message_0265_0141_0000$$$::"...Come to think of it, the overseer's son being chosen as Master was not something that was supposed to happen.[lr]::
33293::$$$message_0265_0141_0001$$$::My father passed away at that time. After that, I took over the role of overseer and guard the Holy Grail here in the church."::
33294::$$$message_0265_0142_0000$$$::Saying that, this priest named Kirei Kotomine turned away.[lr]::
33295::$$$message_0265_0142_0001$$$::Following his gaze leads to the symbol of worship towering over us.::
33296::$$$message_0265_0143_0000$$$::"Our conversation ends here.[lr]::
33297::$$$message_0265_0143_0001$$$::The only ones who are qualified to obtain the Holy Grail are Masters with Servants. When there is only one left of the seven participants, the grail will manifest.[lr]::
33298::$$$message_0265_0143_0002$$$::You must decide now whether you will participate in this battle, this Holy Grail War."[lr]::
33299::$$$message_0265_0143_0003$$$::The priest requests my final decision as he looks down at me.::
33300::$$$message_0265_0144_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33301::$$$message_0265_0144_0001$$$::I'm at a loss for words.[lr]::
33302::$$$message_0265_0144_0002$$$::Until this very moment, I had no reason to fight.[lr]::
33303::$$$message_0265_0144_0003$$$::But now I have a reason, and the will to accompany it.[lr]::
33304::$$$message_0265_0144_0004$$$::Although...is this really what I want?::
33305::$$$message_0265_0145_0000$$$::"Are you still undecided?[lr]::
33306::$$$message_0265_0145_0001$$$::Understand that being a Master is not something you become just because you wish it so. Rin has been training as a mage for a long time, but that does not mean that it was determined that she would be a Master.[lr]::
33307::$$$message_0265_0145_0002$$$::All she could do is decide whether to prepare or not if the opportunity arose."::
33308::$$$message_0265_0146_0000$$$::"Only mages are chosen as Masters. If you are a mage, you should have already been ready.[lr]::
33309::$$$message_0265_0146_0001$$$::If you are not, then I suppose nothing further can be done.[lr]::
33310::$$$message_0265_0146_0002$$$::Both you and your instructor are failures. It would be a nusiance for a mage such as you to go into battle, so you should remove your Command Spells right now."::
33311::$$$message_0265_0147_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
33312::$$$message_0265_0147_0001$$$::It isn't even a question now.[lr]::
33313::$$$message_0265_0147_0002$$$::I refuse to run.[lr]::
33314::$$$message_0265_0147_0003$$$::To be honest, this Master and Holy Grail War stuff doesn't feel real at all.[lr]::
33315::$$$message_0265_0147_0004$$$::Even so, if I have to choose between fighting or running away, I would never run away.::
33316::$$$message_0265_0148_0000$$$::The priest even said it.[lr]::
33317::$$$message_0265_0148_0001$$$::If I'm a mage, I should be prepared.::
33318::$$$message_0265_0149_0000$$$::So I need to get it together.[lr]::
33319::$$$message_0265_0149_0001$$$::Even if I'm an amateur, I'm still a mage.[lr]::
33320::$$$message_0265_0149_0002$$$::If I decided that I'm going to champion justice and follow in Kiritsugu Emiya's footsteps after admiring him for so long...::
33321::$$$message_0265_0150_0000$$$::"...I'll fight as a Master. If the cause of the fire ten years ago was the Holy Grail War, then I can't let that happen ever again."[lr]::
33322::$$$message_0265_0150_0001$$$::The priest must've liked my answer as he is smiling with satisfaction.::
33323::$$$message_0265_0151_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33324::$$$message_0265_0151_0001$$$::   I threw away all my hesitation.[lr]::
33325::$$$message_0265_0151_0002$$$::I've got to man up and fight.[lr]::
33326::$$$message_0265_0151_0003$$$::I said I would do it, and so I'll face this on my pride as a mage.::
33327::$$$message_0265_0152_0000$$$::"Well then, I shall approve you as Saber's Master.[lr]::
33328::$$$message_0265_0152_0001$$$::From this moment on, the Holy Grail War is officially underway.[lr]::
33329::$$$message_0265_0152_0002$$$::Until there is one Master left, I approve of the battle in this town. Each shall put their pride and very life on the line and fight to their heart's content."::
33330::$$$message_0265_0153_0000$$$::The priest's words echo throughout the church.[lr]::
33331::$$$message_0265_0153_0001$$$::Although there's no real purpose to his declaration.[lr]::
33332::$$$message_0265_0153_0002$$$::Only Tohsaka and I heard his words.[lr]::
33333::$$$message_0265_0153_0003$$$::This man just carried out his own little ceremony, ringing the starting bell.::
33334::$$$message_0265_0154_0000$$$::"It's offical, then. I'll be heading out, but can I ask you a question too, Kirei?"[lr]::
33335::$$$message_0265_0154_0001$$$::"I don't mind. This may be the last time, so I will answer anything further."::
33336::$$$message_0265_0155_0000$$$::"Then I'll take up on that. Kirei, since you're in charge of overseeing everything, you should have information about other Masters, right? I've followed the Association's rules, so at least tell me what you know."::
33337::$$$message_0265_0156_0000$$$::"That certainly puts me in a bind. I would be more than happy to tell you, but I do not know much myself.[lr]::
33338::$$$message_0265_0156_0001$$$::There are not many legitimate mages this time. I am only aware of two Masters. Three if you include Shirou Emiya, actually."::
33339::$$$message_0265_0157_0000$$$::"Oh, really. Then you should know by the order they were summoned.[lr]::
33340::$$$message_0265_0157_0001$$$::You are the overseer, after all."[lr]::
33341::$$$message_0265_0157_0002$$$::"...Hm. The first one was Berserker, the second was Caster. And so on and so forth. The other day was Archer, and then Saber was summoned a few hours ago."::
33342::$$$message_0265_0158_0000$$$::"...I see. So that means..."[lr]::
33343::$$$message_0265_0158_0001$$$::"The Holy Grail War has officially begun. Rin, you are not allowed to come to this church until this Holy Grail War is over.[lr]::
33344::$$$message_0265_0158_0002$$$::The only time it is permitted is..."[lr]::
33345::$$$message_0265_0158_0003$$$::"When I lose my Servant and wish for protection, right? So if I rely on you anymore than that, no perfect score."::
33346::$$$message_0265_0159_0000$$$::"That is correct. You would likely be the victor, but the Church will not ignore your transgressions. The likely result is you are forced to listen to a lecture and they take away your Holy Grail. That would also be problematic for me."[lr]::
33347::$$$message_0265_0159_0001$$$::"You fake priest. You're with the Church, but you're going to support the Mage's Association?"::
33348::$$$message_0265_0160_0000$$$::"I am serving the Lord. That does not mean that I am serving the Church."[lr]::
33349::$$$message_0265_0160_0001$$$::"Yeah, right. That's why you're a fake."::
33350::$$$message_0265_0161_0000$$$::Tohsaka turns her back to Kirei Kotomine.[lr]::
33351::$$$message_0265_0161_0001$$$::With that, she makes her way towards the exit without saying goodbye.::
33352::$$$message_0265_0162_0000$$$::"Hey, are you fine with that, Tohsaka? He's your senior, right? Then..."[lr]::
33353::$$$message_0265_0162_0001$$$::You sure you want to leave it like this, without a proper farewell? ::
33354::$$$message_0265_0163_0000$$$::"It's fine. In fact, it's a relief to cut him off. And you should get out now, too. You have no business with this church anymore."[lr]::
33355::$$$message_0265_0163_0001$$$::Tohsaka crosses the chapel and, without stopping, really does leave without so much as a goodbye.::
33356::$$$message_0265_0164_0000$$$::I sigh and follow Tohsaka.[lr]::
33357::$$$message_0265_0164_0001$$$::Then...[lr]::
33358::$$$message_0265_0164_0002$$$::"...!"[lr]::
33359::$$$message_0265_0164_0003$$$::I feel the presence behind me and can't help but turn around.[lr]::
33360::$$$message_0265_0164_0004$$$::He crossed the distance before I knew it to loom over me.::
33361::$$$message_0265_0165_0000$$$::"W-what? Do you still have something to say?"[lr]::
33362::$$$message_0265_0165_0001$$$::Though I can't help but take a step back.[lr]::
33363::$$$message_0265_0165_0002$$$::...Just as I thought, I'm no good with this guy.[lr]::
33364::$$$message_0265_0165_0003$$$::It's like we're incompatible or on a different wavelength. I'm not fond of the feeling.::
33365::$$$message_0265_0166_0000$$$::"If you don't have anything to say, I'm leaving!"[lr]::
33366::$$$message_0265_0166_0001$$$::I head towards the exit, trying to escape his stare.[lr]::
33367::$$$message_0265_0166_0002$$$::As I go...[lr]::
33368::$$$message_0265_0166_0003$$$::"...Rejoice, boy. Your wishes will soon be granted."[lr]::
33369::$$$message_0265_0166_0004$$$::So the priest says, as if he's an oracle.::
33370::$$$message_0265_0167_0000$$$::Those words are...[lr]::
33371::$$$message_0265_0167_0001$$$::Are they really what I've been feeling deep down?::
33372::$$$message_0265_0168_0000$$$::"...What's this, all of a sudden?"[lr]::
33373::$$$message_0265_0168_0001$$$::"You should know. If there was no clear evil, then your wishes wouldn't be granted. Though it may be difficult to swallow, one who champions justice needs an evil to defeat."::
33374::$$$message_0265_0169_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
33375::$$$message_0265_0169_0001$$$::My vision is about to go black.[lr]::
33376::$$$message_0265_0169_0002$$$::The priest says it.[lr]::
33377::$$$message_0265_0169_0003$$$::My wish is at the same time noble and shameful.[lr]::
33378::$$$message_0265_0169_0004$$$::...Yes. The desire to protect something is...[lr]::
33379::$$$message_0265_0169_0005$$$::...the same as wanting a threat to harm it.::
33380::$$$message_0265_0170_0000$$$::"...Y-you..."[lr]::
33381::$$$message_0265_0170_0001$$$::But there's no way that I would wish something like that.[lr]::

33383::$$$message_0265_0170_0003$$$::That just means...[lr]::
33384::$$$message_0265_0170_0004$$$::...my aspirations and ideals have a contradiction.[lr]::
33385::$$$message_0265_0170_0005$$$::"Good thing you have an enemy to face, now."[lr]::
33386::$$$message_0265_0170_0006$$$::That's what the priest is saying, his words like a dagger to my gut.::
33387::$$$message_0265_0171_0000$$$::"What, no need to keep up appearances. Your dilemma is valid as a human being."[lr]::
