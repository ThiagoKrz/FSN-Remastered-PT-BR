69945::$$$message_0640_0000_0000$$$::AH...AH, AH...AH...::
69946::$$$message_0640_0001_0000$$$::Black flames envelop her.[lr]::
69947::$$$message_0640_0001_0001$$$::The extravagantly built hall crumbles in a merciless, senseless struggle.::
69948::$$$message_0640_0002_0000$$$::...AH...ah, ah...ah...::
69949::$$$message_0640_0003_0000$$$::The rising flames are like a heat haze.[lr]::
69950::$$$message_0640_0003_0001$$$::A once-shapeless shadow pulverizes the walls and floors in time with its host's anguish.::
69951::$$$message_0640_0004_0000$$$::Ha...ugh, ARGH...Ahhh, ah...!::
69952::$$$message_0640_0005_0000$$$::The dark haze dances to the melody.[lr]::
69953::$$$message_0640_0005_0001$$$::She stands in the middle of the hall, hunched over. Each time she scratches in anguish at her throat, the ancient castle's beauty crumbles further.[lr]::
69954::$$$message_0640_0005_0002$$$::   But there's nothing to grieve.[lr]::
69955::$$$message_0640_0005_0003$$$::This castle was always empty. It is a long-forgotten winter fort.[lr]::
69956::$$$message_0640_0005_0004$$$::Nobody sees it and nobody lives in it, so it doesn't matter if it's destroyed.::
69957::$$$message_0640_0006_0000$$$::"ah...uah...ah...aaahhh...ah..."::
69958::$$$message_0640_0007_0000$$$::The hall is becoming a kingdom of shadow.[lr]::
69959::$$$message_0640_0007_0001$$$::In its center is a suffering woman who is both monarch and slave.[lr]::
69960::$$$message_0640_0007_0002$$$::It has been a day since she brought Illyasviel here.[lr]::
69961::$$$message_0640_0007_0003$$$::She[line2]Sakura Matou's transformation is approaching its final phase.::
69962::$$$message_0640_0008_0000$$$::She is merging with the shadow, and her mere physical existence in this world is torture.[lr]::
69963::$$$message_0640_0008_0001$$$::Her body is racked by pain. Her cognitive circuits are being rewritten with destructive impulses.[lr]::
69964::$$$message_0640_0008_0002$$$::...If that was the end of her Darkening, she could tolerate it.[lr]::
69965::$$$message_0640_0008_0003$$$::She is accustomed to physical pain and torment.::
69966::$$$message_0640_0009_0000$$$::But the heartbreak of having her very being denied is new.[lr]::
69967::$$$message_0640_0009_0001$$$::The shadow cannot exist in this world.[lr]::
69968::$$$message_0640_0009_0002$$$::It cannot receive any of the world's blessings.::
69969::$$$message_0640_0010_0000$$$::"urgh...ah...ah...Ah...!"::
69970::$$$message_0640_0011_0000$$$::She tears at her throat.[lr]::
69971::$$$message_0640_0011_0001$$$::Bluntly put, the girl undergoing the Darkening process cannot breathe.[lr]::
69972::$$$message_0640_0011_0002$$$::The air is toxic.[lr]::
69973::$$$message_0640_0011_0003$$$::For Sakura, who is transforming into a deep sea-dwelling shadow, the earth is no different from the vacuum of outer space.::
69974::$$$message_0640_0012_0000$$$::"AH...AAAHH, ahhhhhh...!!!"::
69975::$$$message_0640_0013_0000$$$::So, she dances.[lr]::
69976::$$$message_0640_0013_0001$$$::She forgets her self, loses her sanity, and feels fury at everything she can see.[lr]::
69977::$$$message_0640_0013_0002$$$::It's suffocating, she thinks.[lr]::
69978::$$$message_0640_0013_0003$$$::She blames the uncaring, unknowing world for her own misfortune.::
69979::$$$message_0640_0014_0000$$$::"Now, it's about time. You managed to remain as Sakura Matou longer than I expected, but you just need one more push to become a flesh vessel."[lr]::
69980::$$$message_0640_0014_0001$$$::Two shadows watch this sight.[lr]::
69981::$$$message_0640_0014_0002$$$::An old mage, Zouken Matou, and his Servant, Assassin.::
69982::$$$message_0640_0015_0000$$$::"One more push? I'm quite tired of hearing that phrase, Lord Mage. Victory is all but assured. You do not need any Servants other than me. We should have her absorb the remaining two Servants quickly."[lr]::
69983::$$$message_0640_0015_0001$$$::"I know. But she refuses to kill the Servants that she takes in. I don't know if she is short-sighted or spineless. Saber and Berserker remain in Sakura's thrall. She allows them to live when it would be fine to kill them."::
69984::$$$message_0640_0016_0000$$$::"...What? Saber is not her only pawn?"[lr]::
69985::$$$message_0640_0016_0001$$$::"Yes. She is probably keeping him to use against me. How thoughtless. The more Servants she holds on to, the more power she must draw from the Holy Grail. Only a Lesser Grail such as herself can receive such power from the Greater Grail, but she is receiving more than just magical energy.[lr]::
69986::$$$message_0640_0016_0002$$$::It hastens her transformation as long as she lets the Servants live. Even if I do nothing, her mind will be devoured, and she will turn into my ideal tool."::
69987::$$$message_0640_0017_0000$$$::The old mage laughs, sneering down at the suffering girl.[lr]::
69988::$$$message_0640_0017_0001$$$::There is affection in his eyes.[lr]::
69989::$$$message_0640_0017_0002$$$::He does love.[lr]::
69990::$$$message_0640_0017_0003$$$::His experimental subject has exceeded his expectations and will soon bless him with his long-sought immortality.::
69991::$$$message_0640_0018_0000$$$::How could he not love her?[lr]::
69992::$$$message_0640_0018_0001$$$::In the old mage's eyes. Sakura Matou is a beautiful bride.[lr]::
69993::$$$message_0640_0018_0002$$$::No matter how she struggles, she will become his.[lr]::
69994::$$$message_0640_0018_0003$$$::It doesn't matter that she's collecting power, controlling more Servants, and attempting to preserve her sanity.[lr]::
69995::$$$message_0640_0018_0004$$$::Eleven years ago, Zouken obtained control over Sakura's fate.[lr]::
69996::$$$message_0640_0018_0005$$$::All it would take for the old mage to kill Sakura is to blink.::
69997::$$$message_0640_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
69998::$$$message_0640_0019_0001$$$::...But the white skull is different.[lr]::
69999::$$$message_0640_0019_0002$$$::As an ominous symbol and a gust who carries death, he is sensitive to others like him.::
70000::$$$message_0640_0020_0000$$$::"You underestimate her, Lord Mage. Now..."[lr]::
70001::$$$message_0640_0020_0001$$$::Will this go as well as he hopes?[lr]::
70002::$$$message_0640_0020_0002$$$::The situation will not change, even if the girl loses her mind.[lr]::
70003::$$$message_0640_0020_0003$$$::That thing reacts to hostility and bloodlust.::
70004::$$$message_0640_0021_0000$$$::In that sense, the girl raving beneath them will be no different even after she loses her sanity.[lr]::
70005::$$$message_0640_0021_0001$$$::Zouken Matou is conceited.[lr]::
70006::$$$message_0640_0021_0002$$$::Assassin doubts that the girl will be as obedient as Zouken thinks, once her reason is gone.::
70007::$$$message_0640_0022_0000$$$::"...Lord Mage. Do you actually have a way to control the girl? Her defensive instincts against threats are too powerful. Without her mind, she may become unable to distinguish friend from foe, and your voice might not reach her.[lr]::
70008::$$$message_0640_0022_0001$$$::Once she reaches that point, it will be impossible to approach her even by concealing one's bloodlust.[lr]::
70009::$$$message_0640_0022_0002$$$::That thing is a type of existence that can sense outside threats to its life, and promptly eliminates them."::
70010::$$$message_0640_0023_0000$$$::"Oh? I see. That sounds quite promising. I feel even better about using it as a host."[lr]::
70011::$$$message_0640_0023_0001$$$::The old mage cackles.::
70012::$$$message_0640_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
70013::$$$message_0640_0024_0001$$$::The white skull watches the crumbling hall in silence.[lr]::
70014::$$$message_0640_0024_0002$$$::...To be honest, he does not agree with the mage's thinking.[lr]::
70015::$$$message_0640_0024_0003$$$::His goal may be immortality, but something seems twisted about his course of action and his methods.[lr]::
70016::$$$message_0640_0024_0004$$$::No, he has always been a rotten human being.[lr]::
70017::$$$message_0640_0024_0005$$$::It's natural that the old man would be a maniac, but there doesn't seem to be any consistency to his methods.::
70018::$$$message_0640_0025_0000$$$::"Oho, did you hear that, Assassin!? 'Please help me, Grandfather!' Good, good! That begging takes me back eleven years![lr]::
70019::$$$message_0640_0025_0001$$$::It must be so painful to be rejected and oppressed by the world, Sakura![lr]::
70020::$$$message_0640_0025_0002$$$::But bear with it. Your body can take it. Remember the days you spent in the kodoku jar eleven years ago![lr]::
70021::$$$message_0640_0025_0003$$$::What did you endure thousands of tortures for? What did you give your body over to tens of thousands of insects for? That's right, this level of pain is nothing for you! I raised you that way! I trained you!"::
70022::$$$message_0640_0026_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
70023::$$$message_0640_0026_0001$$$::Apparently the old mage can hear what the girl is saying.[lr]::
70024::$$$message_0640_0026_0002$$$::Assassin only hears her agony, but she does seem to be begging her grandfather for help.::
70025::$$$message_0640_0027_0000$$$::"Yes, of course I will help you! You are my masterpiece. I'll watch over you until the very end! But I can only help your body. It seems that your mind did not keep up with the years of training.[lr]::
70026::$$$message_0640_0027_0001$$$::I know you can't tolerate the resentment, after you accepted it and ran from the pain. But don't worry. I guarantee that your body is sound! It will last until your flesh wears Avenger itself!"::
70027::$$$message_0640_0028_0000$$$::The old mage keeps laughing.[lr]::
70028::$$$message_0640_0028_0001$$$::Assassin steps back, watching heartlessly.::
70029::$$$message_0640_0029_0000$$$::"Hm? Where are you going, Assassin?[lr]::
70030::$$$message_0640_0029_0001$$$::I need you here to protect me from it, just in case."[lr]::
70031::$$$message_0640_0029_0002$$$::"...I do not mind that, but I have some objections to fixating on the Black Grail at the expense of letting the White Grail free in the building. Why would you let her play, after all the trouble you went through to obtain a proper Holy Grail?"[lr]::
70032::$$$message_0640_0029_0003$$$::"Oh, that. Illyasviel is cooperating with me. She has lived her whole life waiting to open the gate. She agreed with me because I would help her accomplish that."::
70033::$$$message_0640_0030_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
70034::$$$message_0640_0030_0001$$$::"Don't be so suspicious. She is the Holy Grail you seek. She will leave her name in history and become the original. The Einzberns can grant your wish of being recorded in history.[lr]::
70035::$$$message_0640_0030_0002$$$::But you will need to take it once she reverts to her original form. Homunculi are out of my area of expertise. Let her do what she wants until the dress is ready."::
70036::$$$message_0640_0031_0000$$$::"...So you didn't force her to come.[lr]::
70037::$$$message_0640_0031_0001$$$::Can we truly afford to take such risks?"[lr]::
70038::$$$message_0640_0031_0002$$$::"Yes, we can. We have no more enemies.[lr]::
70039::$$$message_0640_0031_0003$$$::I was surprised that the Emiya boy and the Tohsaka girl still live, but they can do nothing. No one would be foolish enough to challenge us after being shown the overwhelming disparity in power."::
70040::$$$message_0640_0032_0000$$$::"If we are too hasty and allow Illyasviel to die, we could not recover from that mistake.[lr]::
70041::$$$message_0640_0032_0001$$$::She has an obligation to open Heaven's gate. Let us show some compassion and allow her to do her work[line2]Assassin?"[lr]::
70042::$$$message_0640_0032_0002$$$::"Enough talk. Those very same fools are here, it seems."[lr]::
70043::$$$message_0640_0032_0003$$$::"...Hm?"::
70044::$$$message_0640_0033_0000$$$::The white skull disappears a moment later.[lr]::
70045::$$$message_0640_0033_0001$$$::The killer sensed intruders and didn't hesitate to leave the castle.[lr]::
70046::$$$message_0640_0033_0002$$$::The enemy has already left the building.[lr]::
70047::$$$message_0640_0033_0003$$$::They slipped through the careless old mage's grasp and are headed for the castle gate.::
70048::$$$message_0640_0034_0000$$$::"Oh? Do you want to die that badly, boy?"[lr]::
70049::$$$message_0640_0034_0001$$$::But he isn't careless.[lr]::
70050::$$$message_0640_0034_0002$$$::No matter what happens, he will not let Illyasviel escape.[lr]::
70051::$$$message_0640_0034_0003$$$::In essence, the long-held wish of the Einzberns has been placed on her shoulders.[lr]::
70052::$$$message_0640_0034_0004$$$::That pale girl is willing to cooperate with Zouken, even without his urging.[lr]::
70053::$$$message_0640_0034_0005$$$::And they think they can take her and leave? How laughable.[lr]::
70054::$$$message_0640_0034_0006$$$::Once she leaves the forest, Illyasviel will surely reappear in the heart of the Holy Grail, where it all started.::
70055::$$$message_0640_0035_0000$$$::"Hmph. I was willing to let her run free, but it can't be helped.[lr]::
70056::$$$message_0640_0035_0001$$$::...Time to go to work, Sakura. You cannot be saved without Illyasviel. If you want to be free of your pain, then crush them all."[lr]::
70057::$$$message_0640_0035_0002$$$::The old mage cackles, and then his presence vanishes.::
70058::$$$message_0640_0036_0000$$$::A shadow crouches in the hall.[lr]::
70059::$$$message_0640_0036_0001$$$::The shadows have covered the entire hall. It is a black swamp, and two bodies appear in its muck.::
70060::$$$message_0640_0037_0000$$$::"..."::
70061::$$$message_0640_0038_0000$$$::The girl feels no pain.[lr]::
70062::$$$message_0640_0038_0001$$$::She hasn't gotten accustomed to the poison.[lr]::
70063::$$$message_0640_0038_0002$$$::All she can think is,[lr]::
70064::$$$message_0640_0038_0003$$$::"...Oh. You came for me, Senpai."::
70065::$$$message_0640_0038_0004$$$::Her dark joy overcomes her grim suffering.::
70066::$$$message_0640_0039_0000$$$::"He's with the priest, too. Stupid man. Why would he come feed himself to me?"[lr]::
70067::$$$message_0640_0039_0001$$$::She lifts a finger.[lr]::
70068::$$$message_0640_0039_0002$$$::It points toward the castle gate, where the intruders are desperately trying to escape.::
70069::$$$message_0640_0040_0000$$$::"Go. Kill everyone except Senpai. Slaughter everyone else, no matter who they are."::
70070::$$$message_0640_0041_0000$$$::She unleashes the dark giant.[lr]::
70071::$$$message_0640_0041_0001$$$::Her hunting hound roars and storms off into the distance.::
70072::$$$message_0640_0042_0000$$$::"Of course... it's not as if you can tell who anyone is now, Berserker."::
70073::$$$message_0640_0043_0000$$$::She giggles.[lr]::
70074::$$$message_0640_0043_0001$$$::Cloaked in shadow, the girl slowly leaves a ruined kingdom with her dark knight.::
