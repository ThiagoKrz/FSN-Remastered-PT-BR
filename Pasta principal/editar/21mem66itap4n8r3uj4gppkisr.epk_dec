10253::$$$message_0103_0000_0001$$$::I ask, not really expecting a response.::

10255::$$$message_0103_0001_0001$$$::There's no change in Rider. Just her long hair fluttering in the wind.::

10265::$$$message_0103_0006_0001$$$::And take good care of Shinji. As you can see, he's a bit of a pain, but I hope you can protect him."[lr]::

10267::$$$message_0103_0006_0003$$$::I guess that was funny, because...::
10268::$$$message_0103_0007_0000$$$::"You are a noble soul. I can see why Shinji warmed to you."[lr]::
10269::$$$message_0103_0007_0001$$$::Rider giggles softly, then disappears into the Matou house.::
