16869::$$$message_0155_0000_0000$$$::"Then it's my turn to argue.[lr]::
16870::$$$message_0155_0000_0001$$$::I'm sorry to jump in after you've convinced Saber, but I don't agree.[lr]::
16871::$$$message_0155_0000_0002$$$::Look, Shirou. She's still a Master. She may have lost her Servant, but I also told you that as long as she has Command Spells, she is still a Master."::
16872::$$$message_0155_0001_0000$$$::She says that...[lr]::
16873::$$$message_0155_0001_0001$$$::Tohsaka just butts in while she sips her tea.::
16874::$$$message_0155_0002_0000$$$::"Eh? Hey, what is that supposed to mean, Tohsaka?"::
16875::$$$message_0155_0003_0000$$$::"I'm saying that as long as she has her Command Spells, she can form a contract with as many Servants as she wants.[lr]::
16876::$$$message_0155_0003_0001$$$::There are stray Servants who don't have Masters, and as long as a Master has the capacity to take in that stray Servant, they can form contracts with as many as they want."::
16877::$$$message_0155_0004_0000$$$::"Wh-what the heck?[lr]::
16878::$$$message_0155_0004_0001$$$::So, if there's a capable Master around, they can form contracts with as many Servants as they want?"::
16879::$$$message_0155_0005_0000$$$::"Not exactly as many as they want. The Holy Grail can only call upon seven Heroic Spirits, so seven would be the maximum.[lr]::
16880::$$$message_0155_0005_0001$$$::Though, no matter how capable a mage is, they couldn't have enough magical energy to power multiple Servants."::
16881::$$$message_0155_0006_0000$$$::"Even if they did, they would have to divide their own magical energy in half to supply the two Servants. That would weaken the Servants, which would make forming multiple contracts difficult and pointless."::
16882::$$$message_0155_0007_0000$$$::...I see.[lr]::
16883::$$$message_0155_0007_0001$$$::So if I formed a contract with Saber and Berserker, they would have to split my magical energy between them to maintain their existence, which would drastically weaken both of them.[lr]::
16884::$$$message_0155_0007_0002$$$::That means it would make more sense to keep to one Servant and supply them with magical energy.::
16885::$$$message_0155_0008_0000$$$::"Now that you mention it, didn't you say Servants could change Masters? Is this what you meant?"::
16886::$$$message_0155_0009_0000$$$::"Oh, look at you, catching on for a change.[lr]::
16887::$$$message_0155_0009_0001$$$::And you're right, Shirou. That's how Servants changing Masters goes.[lr]::
16888::$$$message_0155_0009_0002$$$::A Servant who's lost their Master has some time before disappearing. So, if, in that time, they can find a Master who's seeking a Servant and form a contract, they'll be fine."::
16889::$$$message_0155_0010_0000$$$::"Yes. So that's why you can't let your guard down with Rin, Shirou. She's still a Master too. She might kill you and seize Saber, or she might form a new contract with another surviving Servant."::
16890::$$$message_0155_0011_0000$$$::"Yep. And I could say the exact same thing about you, Illya."[lr]::
16891::$$$message_0155_0011_0001$$$::"Hmph. That's never going to happen.[lr]::
16892::$$$message_0155_0011_0002$$$::I don't intend on teaming up with another Servant. My Servant is and will only ever be Berserker."::
16893::$$$message_0155_0012_0000$$$::I don't know what kind of relationship Illya and Berserker had.[lr]::
16894::$$$message_0155_0012_0001$$$::But I do know that Servant was special to her.::
16895::$$$message_0155_0013_0000$$$::   That is a surprise, but at the same time it makes me happy.[lr]::
16896::$$$message_0155_0013_0001$$$::I'm happy to know that despite the fact that as Master, Illya was relentless, she still cherished her partner.::
16897::$$$message_0155_0014_0000$$$::"Oh, but if Shirou loses, I'll take Saber.[lr]::
16898::$$$message_0155_0014_0001$$$::I won't let anyone other than Shirou win.[lr]::
16899::$$$message_0155_0014_0002$$$::But if Shirou loses, I'll win on his behalf."[lr]::
16900::$$$message_0155_0014_0003$$$::Illya says that proudly, just as she was starting to impress Saber and Tohsaka.::
16901::$$$message_0155_0015_0000$$$::"That is ridiculous. I am Shirou's Servant. I have no intention of becoming your Servant."::
16902::$$$message_0155_0016_0000$$$::"Huh. Well, I don't care anyway.[lr]::
16903::$$$message_0155_0016_0001$$$::I just want Shirou to win. Whether I win or Saber protects Shirou, it's all the same to me."::
16904::$$$message_0155_0017_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
16905::$$$message_0155_0017_0001$$$::What a weird thing to say.[lr]::
16906::$$$message_0155_0017_0002$$$::...Actually, if she wants me to win, why would she think like that anyway?[lr]::
16907::$$$message_0155_0017_0003$$$::And then...[lr]::
16908::$$$message_0155_0017_0004$$$::Tohsaka must have found it strange too. She starts to think.::
16909::$$$message_0155_0018_0000$$$::"I certainly mind! I will not approve, no matter what![lr]::
16910::$$$message_0155_0018_0001$$$::Rin. Please warn Shirou yourself!"[lr]::
16911::$$$message_0155_0018_0002$$$::"Eh? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. Tell him what, Saber?"[lr]::
16912::$$$message_0155_0018_0003$$$::"About how we are against sheltering Illyasviel here!"::
16913::$$$message_0155_0019_0000$$$::"Oh, that? I guess sheltering her here wouldn't be a terrible idea."[lr]::
16914::$$$message_0155_0019_0001$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
16915::$$$message_0155_0019_0002$$$::Saber freezes.[lr]::
16916::$$$message_0155_0019_0003$$$::I had advocated for this, and even I'm surprised. I don't blame the opposing Saber for being frozen in shock.::
16917::$$$message_0155_0020_0000$$$::"R-Rin!? Have you lost your mind!?"::
16918::$$$message_0155_0021_0000$$$::"No. If I think about this rationally, I see the risks are all the same. It doesn't matter whether we leave Illya alone, give her shelter here, or send her off to the Church.[lr]::
16919::$$$message_0155_0021_0001$$$::It may even work out in our favor if Masters come here looking for Illya."::
16920::$$$message_0155_0022_0000$$$::"With Saber as she is now, she would be hard even for multiple Servants to defeat if they attacked together. That'd be the fastest way to end this Holy Grail War, and that's what you want too, isn't it, Saber?[lr]::
16921::$$$message_0155_0022_0001$$$::But, if you think you'd lose to other Servants, that's another story."::
16922::$$$message_0155_0023_0000$$$::"Of course not. You understand my condition perfectly. So long as Shirou is my Master, I cannot be defeated."::
16923::$$$message_0155_0024_0000$$$::"Right? Then us sheltering Illya isn't a problem."[lr]::
16924::$$$message_0155_0024_0001$$$::And there's something else. Shirou's decision might have actually been a really smart move."::
16925::$$$message_0155_0025_0000$$$::Tohsaka goes quiet.[lr]::
16926::$$$message_0155_0025_0001$$$::She must have convinced Saber, who reluctantly takes a step back from Illya.::
16927::$$$message_0155_0026_0000$$$::We finish breakfast then move to the dojo.[lr]::
16928::$$$message_0155_0026_0001$$$::Tohsaka goes back to her own room, while Saber follows me.::
16929::$$$message_0155_0027_0000$$$::As for Illya...[lr]::
16930::$$$message_0155_0027_0001$$$::"Hey. Are you really going to do some sword training?"[lr]::
16931::$$$message_0155_0027_0002$$$::She follows me to the dojo, like we're joined at the hip.::
16932::$$$message_0155_0028_0000$$$::"I was looking forward to hanging out with you today, Shirou. But Saber's in the way, it's boring here, and I'm cooold."::
16933::$$$message_0155_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
16934::$$$message_0155_0029_0001$$$::Well, I'm not surprised Illya thinks this is boring.[lr]::
16935::$$$message_0155_0029_0002$$$::Watching someone train isn't what I'd call exciting.::
16936::$$$message_0155_0030_0000$$$::"Let's go back to the living room. If you want to get stronger, I'll help you."::
16937::$$$message_0155_0031_0000$$$::Illya takes one of my hands in both of hers and tries to tug me away from the dojo.[lr]::
16938::$$$message_0155_0031_0001$$$::But, at least in this, I can't indulge Illya.::
16939::$$$message_0155_0032_0000$$$::"No, I can't, Illya. I train every day, so I can't miss today. I'm not a proper mage, so I need to work hard to be ready to fight.[lr]::
16940::$$$message_0155_0032_0001$$$::Besides, if I train, I can protect you too, Illya.[lr]::
16941::$$$message_0155_0032_0002$$$::I decided to shelter you here, so I should train to help me do just that."::
16942::$$$message_0155_0033_0000$$$::"Eh...okay. You may be right.[lr]::
16943::$$$message_0155_0033_0001$$$::But I really don't need you protecting me. You're my brother, so I just need you to be with me."::
16944::$$$message_0155_0034_0000$$$::It seems I failed to convince her.[lr]::
16945::$$$message_0155_0034_0001$$$::Illya tugs more aggressively at my hand.::
16946::$$$message_0155_0035_0000$$$::Saber watches silently all the while.[lr]::
16947::$$$message_0155_0035_0001$$$::Her eyes burn into the pair of us.[lr]::
16948::$$$message_0155_0035_0002$$$::She must still not approve of Illya being here, and is being more than a little cold toward her.::
16949::$$$message_0155_0036_0000$$$::And then our eyes meet.[lr]::
16950::$$$message_0155_0036_0001$$$::Good timing. I'll ask for Saber's opinion.::
16951::$$$message_0155_0037_0000$$$::"I said, I can't.[lr]::
16952::$$$message_0155_0037_0001$$$::Tell her, Saber. Tell her I train with you every day."::
16953::$$$message_0155_0038_0000$$$::"There is nothing for me to say.[lr]::
16954::$$$message_0155_0038_0001$$$::You are the one who has brought Illyasviel here.[lr]::
16955::$$$message_0155_0038_0002$$$::Persuading her is your duty, not mine."::
16956::$$$message_0155_0039_0000$$$::"...Ugh."[lr]::
16957::$$$message_0155_0039_0001$$$::I don't know why, but I guess she's really ticked now.::
16958::$$$message_0155_0040_0000$$$::"Oh. You know your place well, Saber.[lr]::
16959::$$$message_0155_0040_0001$$$::You don't need to train. The ones left are all weak, so you don't need to bother with this.[lr]::
16960::$$$message_0155_0040_0002$$$::Come on, Shirou. Let Saber take care of the other Masters, and we can just go play outside."::
16961::$$$message_0155_0041_0000$$$::"Whoa...hey, slow down."[lr]::
16962::$$$message_0155_0041_0001$$$::I lose my balance, and feel myself being tugged toward the dojo's exit.::
16963::$$$message_0155_0042_0000$$$::"Hey! No. Let go, Illya! I'm not going to indulge you this time. I'm not skipping my sword training! I'm going to stick to it.[lr]::
16964::$$$message_0155_0042_0001$$$::Sure, you might think it's boring, but I enjoy it. If you're going to complain, then go wait in the living room."::
16965::$$$message_0155_0043_0000$$$::I shake her off violently.[lr]::
16966::$$$message_0155_0043_0001$$$::"Kya!?"[lr]::
16967::$$$message_0155_0043_0002$$$::She obviously didn't expect me to fling her away like that.[lr]::
16968::$$$message_0155_0043_0003$$$::Illya backs off, surprised, then looks at me nervously.::
16969::$$$message_0155_0044_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
16970::$$$message_0155_0044_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Crap.[font italic=false][lr]::
16971::$$$message_0155_0044_0002$$$::I should have been nicer about it.::
16972::$$$message_0155_0045_0000$$$::"Sorry, Illya. I was too rough with you. But I'm not going to give up my sword training. I'm sorry to leave you alone, but please stay in the living room."::
16973::$$$message_0155_0046_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
16974::$$$message_0155_0046_0001$$$::Illya sulks away toward the entrance, but stops by the wall.::
16975::$$$message_0155_0047_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
16976::$$$message_0155_0047_0001$$$::"Fine. I'll watch here.[lr]::
16977::$$$message_0155_0047_0002$$$::You won't mind that, right!?"[lr]::
16978::$$$message_0155_0047_0003$$$::Illya suddenly roars in defiance.[lr]::
16979::$$$message_0155_0047_0004$$$::She glares our way, pitching a small tantrum.::
16980::$$$message_0155_0048_0000$$$::"Eh...well, I don't mind. But it's cold in the dojo, and there's tea and snacks in the living room for you..."::
16981::$$$message_0155_0049_0000$$$::"I made up my mind, so it's fine! Hmph! I'm not going to leave Shirou and Saber alone here!"[lr]::
16982::$$$message_0155_0049_0001$$$::Illya huffs and turns her nose up.::
16983::$$$message_0155_0050_0000$$$::"Oh well... You're more than welcome to go back to the living room if you get bored."[lr]::
16984::$$$message_0155_0050_0001$$$::At least things have settled down.[lr]::
16985::$$$message_0155_0050_0002$$$::I take the two shinai leaning against the wall, and turn to face Saber.::
16986::$$$message_0155_0051_0000$$$::"Then let's begin. It's been three days, so I might be a little rusty... Hey, are you okay, Saber? You look a little dazed. Do you have a fever?"[lr]::
16987::$$$message_0155_0051_0001$$$::"Eh? Oh...it is nothing like that..."[lr]::
16988::$$$message_0155_0051_0002$$$::Saber turns away from Illya, furiously shaking her head.::
16989::$$$message_0155_0052_0000$$$::"So are you all right? Let's begin. Here's your shinai."[lr]::
16990::$$$message_0155_0052_0001$$$::"Uh...please simply throw it to me! You mustn't approach me so haphazardly. W-we are only here to train!"::
16991::$$$message_0155_0053_0000$$$::"That's what I've been saying. What else would we be doing, Saber?"[lr]::
16992::$$$message_0155_0053_0001$$$::A little confused, I toss the shinai to her.[lr]::
16993::$$$message_0155_0053_0002$$$::Besides, I've never once landed a strike on Saber.[lr]::
16994::$$$message_0155_0053_0003$$$::I've never even gotten close to being within striking range of her, so Saber telling me not to come close seems odd.::
16995::$$$message_0155_0054_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
16996::$$$message_0155_0054_0001$$$::Saber takes the shinai I toss her a bit awkwardly, then lets out an audible sigh.::
16997::$$$message_0155_0055_0000$$$::"Then let us begin. Things may not be the same as before, but please try to maintain your composure, Shirou."[lr]::
16998::$$$message_0155_0055_0001$$$::Saber glances at Illya as she speaks.::
16999::$$$message_0155_0056_0000$$$::"I'll be fine. Once we've started, nothing will bother me."[lr]::
17000::$$$message_0155_0056_0001$$$::I grip my shinai and focus on Saber.[lr]::
17001::$$$message_0155_0056_0002$$$::She stands in front of me, shinai in hand.[lr]::
17002::$$$message_0155_0056_0003$$$::Now my attention is fixed only on her.::
17003::$$$message_0155_0057_0000$$$::We spend two hours training, then go on break, as usual.::
17004::$$$message_0155_0058_0000$$$::"Hah...ha... This just reminds me how amazing you are, Saber."[lr]::
17005::$$$message_0155_0058_0001$$$::I nod approvingly, and gulp some water from the kettle I brought along.[lr]::
17006::$$$message_0155_0058_0002$$$::I quench my thirst and wipe the sweat from my neck with a towel, which helps me to finally relax.::
17007::$$$message_0155_0059_0000$$$::"So that was your training? It seems like it was just Shirou getting beat up."[lr]::
17008::$$$message_0155_0059_0001$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
17009::$$$message_0155_0059_0002$$$::Illya is so blunt about things most people would find awkward.::
17010::$$$message_0155_0060_0000$$$::"That's not true, Illya. It may have looked like I'm just getting beat up, but it was actually worse before.[lr]::
17011::$$$message_0155_0060_0001$$$::In fact, I didn't pass out even once, so I'd say I did pretty well today."::
17012::$$$message_0155_0061_0000$$$::"Oh really? But does that have anything to do with your skills, Shirou? From where I was sitting, it looked like Saber ignored plenty of opportunities to attack you."::
17013::$$$message_0155_0062_0000$$$::Illya's expression turns thoughtful.[lr]::
17014::$$$message_0155_0062_0001$$$::...She's sharp.[lr]::
17015::$$$message_0155_0062_0002$$$::I found it odd too, actually.::
17016::$$$message_0155_0063_0000$$$::Either Saber was holding back out of concern for me, or she isn't in top form.[lr]::
17017::$$$message_0155_0063_0001$$$::Whatever the case, Saber didn't go all out.[lr]::
17018::$$$message_0155_0063_0002$$$::Well, she may not always fight seriously while we're training, but she's always been merciless about exploiting openings before.::
17019::$$$message_0155_0064_0000$$$::Today, she lacks drive though.[lr]::
17020::$$$message_0155_0064_0001$$$::Normally, she just rushes in and attacks hard enough to knock me out. But there was none of that today.::
17021::$$$message_0155_0065_0000$$$::"You think so too, Illya? Maybe Saber's given up on me."::
17022::$$$message_0155_0066_0000$$$::"Hmmm, I didn't see it that way.[lr]::
17023::$$$message_0155_0066_0001$$$::But whenever Saber readjusted her grip on the shinai to execute a follow-up blow, she just stopped and stepped back.[lr]::
17024::$$$message_0155_0066_0002$$$::I'm not sure why she did that. It wasn't like she was unwilling to attack, but more like she was scared, or trying to hold back."::
17025::$$$message_0155_0067_0000$$$::"Huh? Saber would never hold back.[lr]::
17026::$$$message_0155_0067_0001$$$::If she had the compassion for that, she wouldn't have beat me so bad that first day."::
17027::$$$message_0155_0068_0000$$$::Yeah. Saber isn't the sort to hold back in training.[lr]::
17028::$$$message_0155_0068_0001$$$::That's why I was able to focus so completely on her weapon.::
17029::$$$message_0155_0069_0000$$$::"...What's gotten into Saber? This isn't training at all. It seems unbelievable, but...did she go easy on me?"::
17030::$$$message_0155_0070_0000$$$::"No, I did not go easy on you.[lr]::
17031::$$$message_0155_0070_0001$$$::I was simply imagining myself facing off against a swordsman somewhat more skilled than Shirou, as usual."[lr]::
17032::$$$message_0155_0070_0002$$$::Something's not right.[lr]::
17033::$$$message_0155_0070_0003$$$::Saber has to see it too.::
17034::$$$message_0155_0071_0000$$$::"Yeah, I can't imagine you ever taking it easy on me, and I know you were being serious.[lr]::
17035::$$$message_0155_0071_0001$$$::But I think you were holding back. If you don't come right at me, this is pointless."::
17036::$$$message_0155_0072_0000$$$::"Right at you? But that would mean I would be getting too close to Master. Depending on what happens, our bodies might come into contact!"::
17037::$$$message_0155_0073_0000$$$::"Huh? Well we're sparring, so I guess we might bump shoulders or something. Besides, you used to slam your whole body into mine to knock me down because you said I wasn't defending myself well enough. And close combat is your specialty, Saber."::
17038::$$$message_0155_0074_0000$$$::"Eh? D-did I do that sort of thing?"::
17039::$$$message_0155_0075_0000$$$::"That's kind of a weird question, but yeah. Frequently.[lr]::
17040::$$$message_0155_0075_0001$$$::Remember how you just slammed me into the wall when we first sparred?[lr]::
17041::$$$message_0155_0075_0002$$$::I said you were pretty strong for a girl, and you said it was natural for a swordsman."::
17042::$$$message_0155_0076_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
17043::$$$message_0155_0076_0001$$$::Saber stands there, dumbfounded.::
17044::$$$message_0155_0077_0000$$$::[font italic=true]What's going on?[font italic=false][lr]::
17045::$$$message_0155_0077_0001$$$::Saber is acting really weird today.[lr]::
17046::$$$message_0155_0077_0002$$$::I'd hate to learn she isn't feeling well. I should talk to Tohsaka later.::
17047::$$$message_0155_0078_0000$$$::We get back to our training, but it's still different than before.[lr]::
17048::$$$message_0155_0078_0001$$$::But after just a few strikes, Saber sets down her shinai.::
17049::$$$message_0155_0079_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
17050::$$$message_0155_0079_0001$$$::Is this a new kind of training?[lr]::
17051::$$$message_0155_0079_0002$$$::She might strike me straight in the head the moment I drop my guard and get close.::
17052::$$$message_0155_0080_0000$$$::"Ha...hah...ha...ah..."[lr]::
17053::$$$message_0155_0080_0001$$$::I breathe hard, watching Saber cautiously.[lr]::
17054::$$$message_0155_0080_0002$$$::Saber narrows her eyes, showing that she is serious now, and steps forward.::
17055::$$$message_0155_0081_0000$$$::"Shirou, let us have lunch."[lr]::
17056::$$$message_0155_0081_0001$$$::That's...not like her.::
17057::$$$message_0155_0082_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
17058::$$$message_0155_0082_0001$$$::I lower my shinai.[lr]::
17059::$$$message_0155_0082_0002$$$::"Lunch? Is it that time already?"::
17060::$$$message_0155_0083_0000$$$::According to the clock, it's a bit before noon.[lr]::
17061::$$$message_0155_0083_0001$$$::It's lunchtime for sure, but this is the first time Saber's been the one to step up and suggest it.[lr]::
17062::$$$message_0155_0083_0002$$$::Neither Saber nor I paid much attention to the time when we trained before.[lr]::
17063::$$$message_0155_0083_0003$$$::We'd take a break, then notice we were hungry, [font italic=true]then[font italic=false] we'd check the clock and see that it was about lunchtime.::
17064::$$$message_0155_0084_0000$$$::"Hmmm..."[lr]::
17065::$$$message_0155_0084_0001$$$::It's a good idea. I could go along with it easily enough.[lr]::
