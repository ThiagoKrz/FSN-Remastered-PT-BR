41631::$$$message_0363_0000_0000$$$::   I saw many corpses.[lr]::
41632::$$$message_0363_0000_0001$$$::I died at that time and was reborn.::
41633::$$$message_0363_0001_0000$$$::I don't have repentances about the path I took.[lr]::
41634::$$$message_0363_0001_0001$$$::My eyes lost their hatred,[lr]::
41635::$$$message_0363_0001_0002$$$::my hands lost their anger,[lr]::
41636::$$$message_0363_0001_0003$$$::my feet lost their hope,[lr]::
41637::$$$message_0363_0001_0004$$$::and I lost myself there.::
41638::$$$message_0363_0002_0000$$$::I lost everything.[lr]::
41639::$$$message_0363_0002_0001$$$::It is not because I gave up that I accepted that nothing would be saved.  [lr]::
41640::$$$message_0363_0002_0002$$$::I just found out that it's natural.[lr]::
41641::$$$message_0363_0002_0003$$$::It's just that dying people will die and survivors will survive.[lr]::
41642::$$$message_0363_0002_0004$$$::I laid down on the mountain of rubble and gazed at the spreading ruins.[lr]::
41643::$$$message_0363_0002_0005$$$::I understood everything then.[lr]::
41644::$$$message_0363_0002_0006$$$::I thought I understood everything.::
41645::$$$message_0363_0003_0000$$$::    But, I still thought about it.[lr]::
41646::$$$message_0363_0003_0001$$$::If I can save everything here...[lr]::
41647::$$$message_0363_0003_0002$$$::How wonderful that would be.::
41648::$$$message_0363_0004_0000$$$::That is what I admired.[lr]::
41649::$$$message_0363_0004_0001$$$::I just thought that it would be nice if no one had to suffer.[lr]::
41650::$$$message_0363_0004_0002$$$::I tried to become a hero of justice for that sake.[lr]::
41651::$$$message_0363_0004_0003$$$::It was easy to understand, and it seemed like an ideal way to live.::
41652::$$$message_0363_0005_0000$$$::That's why I aimed for it.[lr]::
41653::$$$message_0363_0005_0001$$$::I can see where I had to be, and there are many ways to get there.[lr]::
41654::$$$message_0363_0005_0002$$$::I just kept on running, wanting to get as close to it as possible, even though I didn't know what was right or wrong.::
41655::$$$message_0363_0006_0000$$$::Many paths that I took were crooked, and my destination was only getting farther away. [lr]::
41656::$$$message_0363_0006_0001$$$::I'm taking the long way.[lr]::
41657::$$$message_0363_0006_0002$$$::I have been repeating this for ten years since I got saved by Kiritsugu.::
41658::$$$message_0363_0007_0000$$$::But I won't regret it.[lr]::
41659::$$$message_0363_0007_0001$$$::I'm not skilled like Tohsaka.[lr]::
41660::$$$message_0363_0007_0002$$$::I will take the wrong path and lose many things at times.[lr]::
41661::$$$message_0363_0007_0003$$$::But I can't disregard them as meaningless.[lr]::
41662::$$$message_0363_0007_0004$$$::I have to show meaning for why I survived for the sake of things I have trampled over and things that won't come back.::
41663::$$$message_0363_0008_0000$$$::I won't lose for that sake.[lr]::
41664::$$$message_0363_0008_0001$$$::It can't be helped if I lose against others.[lr]::
41665::$$$message_0363_0008_0002$$$::But I can win against myself. I can always resist against my mind that says to give up.[lr]::
41666::$$$message_0363_0008_0003$$$::That's all I swore upon.[lr]::
41667::$$$message_0363_0008_0004$$$::There's only one thing that I believed in and wanted to believe in.::
41668::$$$message_0363_0009_0000$$$::...Yes.[lr]::
41669::$$$message_0363_0009_0001$$$::Even if I'm walking down the wrong path...[lr]::
41670::$$$message_0363_0009_0002$$$::I will not regret believing in it.::
41671::$$$message_0363_0010_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
41672::$$$message_0363_0010_0001$$$::I'm awakened by the light pouring in from outside.[lr]::
41673::$$$message_0363_0010_0002$$$::It's before 6 AM.[lr]::
41674::$$$message_0363_0010_0003$$$::The sky outside the window is cloudy, as if sprinkled with ashes.::
41675::$$$message_0363_0011_0000$$$::I get ready and leave my room.[lr]::
41676::$$$message_0363_0011_0001$$$::My body is in good condition, and there is not much pain in my wound anymore.[lr]::
41677::$$$message_0363_0011_0002$$$::I shouldn't be a burden to Tohsaka like this even if we were to engage in battle.::
41678::$$$message_0363_0012_0000$$$::"...You're here. Are you ready, Shirou?"[lr]::
41679::$$$message_0363_0012_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41680::$$$message_0363_0012_0002$$$::...I'm ready, but...[lr]::
41681::$$$message_0363_0012_0003$$$::Um, Tohsaka has transformed.::
41682::$$$message_0363_0013_0000$$$::"...Mm? What, you look like a newbie soldier who stepped on a mine and can't move. Are you not ready yet?"[lr]::
41683::$$$message_0363_0013_0001$$$::"...No, that's not it. Don't you look different, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
41684::$$$message_0363_0013_0002$$$::"Huh...?[lr]::
41685::$$$message_0363_0013_0003$$$::Oh, these? I put them on when I do detailed work, so don't worry about it."::
41686::$$$message_0363_0014_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
41687::$$$message_0363_0014_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Well.[font italic=false][lr]::
41688::$$$message_0363_0014_0002$$$::I guess that's fine if she says so.[lr]::
41689::$$$message_0363_0014_0003$$$::...I wonder what kind of magecraft this is that makes it look so wrong, yet so right.::
41690::$$$message_0363_0015_0000$$$::"All right. We're heading to the forest in the outskirts.[lr]::
41691::$$$message_0363_0015_0001$$$:: It's a huge sea of trees that is unkempt and far from the city.[lr]::
41692::$$$message_0363_0015_0002$$$::It has rejected human intervention for a long time, so the forest is big and wide. You know that every year a few people go in there without proper preparation and get lost, right?"::
41693::$$$message_0363_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41694::$$$message_0363_0016_0001$$$::I nod silently.[lr]::
41695::$$$message_0363_0016_0002$$$::Our destination is the Einzbern villa that is said to be somewhere in that forest.[lr]::
41696::$$$message_0363_0016_0003$$$::That girl... Our fate is decided the moment our negotiation with Illyasviel breaks down and we end up fighting.[lr]::
41697::$$$message_0363_0016_0004$$$::We can't call for help, and it will be difficult to run away.[lr]::
41698::$$$message_0363_0016_0005$$$::We can't escape from the forest alive if we don't defeat that giant... Berserker.::
41699::$$$message_0363_0017_0000$$$::"Then, let's get going.[lr]::
41700::$$$message_0363_0017_0001$$$::I stayed up all night estimating where it might be, so we should be able to find it in half a day if all goes well.[lr]::
41701::$$$message_0363_0017_0002$$$::We'll take a taxi to the highway, so get some money ready."::
41702::$$$message_0363_0018_0000$$$::She picks up a Boston bag full of things and starts walking.::
41703::$$$message_0363_0019_0000$$$::"...Hm."[lr]::
41704::$$$message_0363_0019_0001$$$::I go after her with my bamboo sword bag in one hand.[lr]::
41705::$$$message_0363_0019_0002$$$::...But, Tohsaka.[lr]::
41706::$$$message_0363_0019_0003$$$::Money for the taxi is fine, but does that mean we'll be walking on the way back home?::
41707::$$$message_0363_0020_0000$$$::   We ride the taxi for an hour from town.[lr]::
41708::$$$message_0363_0020_0001$$$::We ride on the endless highway, passing several mountains, and reach the entrance of the forest.[lr]::
41709::$$$message_0363_0020_0002$$$::Of course, there are no paved roads in the forest.[lr]::
41710::$$$message_0363_0020_0003$$$:: We walk about one kilometer from the highway and finally reach the entrance to the forest.::
41711::$$$message_0363_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41712::$$$message_0363_0021_0001$$$::I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but I can't help but get nervous once I actually face it.[lr]::
41713::$$$message_0363_0021_0002$$$::The forest is dark even though it's daytime.[lr]::
41714::$$$message_0363_0021_0003$$$::The tall branches that cover the sky shut out the sunlight, and it's hard to see more than ten meters ahead, let alone the end of the forest.::
41715::$$$message_0363_0022_0000$$$::"Hey, Shirou. Sorry, but can you walk ahead a bit?"[lr]::
41716::$$$message_0363_0022_0001$$$::"Mm? That's fine, but you're the one who knows where that girl is, right? I don't think anything good will come from having me go ahead."[lr]::
41717::$$$message_0363_0022_0002$$$::I complain as I enter the forest.[lr]::
41718::$$$message_0363_0022_0003$$$::   Then...::
41719::$$$message_0363_0023_0000$$$::"Guh... What the, I just felt a shock...!?"[lr]::
41720::$$$message_0363_0023_0001$$$::I pull back my foot reflexively.[lr]::
41721::$$$message_0363_0023_0002$$$::I only felt numb for an instant.[lr]::
41722::$$$message_0363_0023_0003$$$::The numbness itself is subtle, and it hurts way more to stub your toe on a dresser.[lr]::
41723::$$$message_0363_0023_0004$$$::...Well, it's basically like a static shock.::
41724::$$$message_0363_0024_0000$$$::"...I knew it. I'm sure it's only for identification, but it seems like she has the whole forest under her surveillance."[lr]::
41725::$$$message_0363_0024_0001$$$::"Wait... Hold on. Isn't that bad?[lr]::
41726::$$$message_0363_0024_0002$$$::That means we set off the burglar alarm, right?[lr]::
41727::$$$message_0363_0024_0003$$$::Then..."::
41728::$$$message_0363_0025_0000$$$::"I don't think that's a problem. We didn't come here to surprise attack. We came to talk, so it would be in our favor to let them know we're coming."::
41729::$$$message_0363_0026_0000$$$::"Oh. Be careful, you'll feel a bit of a shock."[lr]::
41730::$$$message_0363_0026_0001$$$::"I know, I know. I saw it happen to you so I know[line2]"[lr]::
41731::$$$message_0363_0026_0002$$$::Tohsaka waves her hand and steps into the forest.[lr]::
41732::$$$message_0363_0026_0003$$$::At that moment...::
41733::$$$message_0363_0027_0000$$$::"WAHHHH!"[lr]::
41734::$$$message_0363_0027_0001$$$::Tohsaka lets out a funny scream and jumps back.::
41735::$$$message_0363_0028_0000$$$::"Wow..."[lr]::
41736::$$$message_0363_0028_0001$$$::I hear crackling electricity.[lr]::
41737::$$$message_0363_0028_0002$$$::I want to believe that it's my imagination that the leaves piled up under Tohsaka's feet are scorched.::
41738::$$$message_0363_0029_0000$$$::"...It seems like the alarm reacts differently depending on the person who steps in. It was like a greeting to me."[lr]::
41739::$$$message_0363_0029_0001$$$::I calmly explain the situation.[lr]::
41740::$$$message_0363_0029_0002$$$::"Khh... Ungh, hnng..."[lr]::
41741::$$$message_0363_0029_0003$$$::But, it doesn't seem like Tohsaka is listening to me.::
41742::$$$message_0363_0030_0000$$$::"That kid has some nerve...! I heard you laugh just now...!"::
41743::$$$message_0363_0031_0000$$$::Tohsaka yells at the empty space where there isn't anyone.[lr]::
41744::$$$message_0363_0031_0001$$$::I don't know where that line went, as her threatening attitude seems like she might go fight instead of talk.::
41745::$$$message_0363_0032_0000$$$::...Well, anyways...[lr]::
41746::$$$message_0363_0032_0001$$$::It seems like talking bad about Tohsaka is fatal no matter how far away you are from her, so I should be careful.::
