37995::$$$message_0328_0000_0000$$$::I'm still not over what happened to Mitsuzuri, leading me to the archery range.[lr]::
37996::$$$message_0328_0000_0001$$$::It's set off from the other school buildings and looks empty.[lr]::
37997::$$$message_0328_0000_0002$$$::Club activities are over, so I don't think I'll find anybody here.::
37998::$$$message_0328_0001_0000$$$::"...I guess I'll go home."[lr]::
37999::$$$message_0328_0001_0001$$$::I turn around and head to the gate.[lr]::
38000::$$$message_0328_0001_0002$$$::   Beyond that, on the way to the exit...[lr]::
38001::$$$message_0328_0001_0003$$$::...Shinji Matou stands there, as if to block my way.::
38002::$$$message_0328_0002_0000$$$::"Hey, you're going home this late? Weren't all students supposed to go home immediately what with the danger and all?"[lr]::
38003::$$$message_0328_0002_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38004::$$$message_0328_0002_0002$$$::I don't have the confidence to stay calm facing Shinji here.[lr]::
38005::$$$message_0328_0002_0003$$$::So I try to ignore him and walk past.::
38006::$$$message_0328_0003_0000$$$::"Aww, man. So tired that you can't even greet your friend, huh?[lr]::
38007::$$$message_0328_0003_0001$$$::Damn, must be draining to spend so much time destroying sigils."[lr]::
38008::$$$message_0328_0003_0002$$$::He sounds like he's grinning.[lr]::
38009::$$$message_0328_0003_0003$$$::"...!"[lr]::
38010::$$$message_0328_0003_0004$$$::Hearing that, I immediately jump back and brace myself.::
38011::$$$message_0328_0004_0000$$$::"Destroying sigils... For you to say that, then..."[lr]::
38012::$$$message_0328_0004_0001$$$::I keep myself on alert and glare at Shinji.::
38013::$$$message_0328_0005_0000$$$::"Yeah, that's right. The Bounded Field that you so thoroughly eliminated was the security measure I set up.[lr]::
38014::$$$message_0328_0005_0001$$$::If it's destroyed like that, I'll be so scared that I won't be able to come to school anymore."::
38015::$$$message_0328_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38016::$$$message_0328_0006_0001$$$::...I see.[lr]::
38017::$$$message_0328_0006_0002$$$::So this is how naïve I am.[lr]::
38018::$$$message_0328_0006_0003$$$::When I saw him in the woods, I knew he was a Master but didn't try to confirm it because I wasn't prepared for the truth.::
38019::$$$message_0328_0007_0000$$$::"Hold on. Don't be on guard like that, Emiya. Since that annoying Tohsaka is gone, let's talk things over like men. You know I deplore fighting."[lr]::
38020::$$$message_0328_0007_0001$$$::"Talk things over...? You don't want to fight?"::
38021::$$$message_0328_0008_0000$$$::"Of course not.[lr]::
38022::$$$message_0328_0008_0001$$$::I'm guessing you were forced to be this Master thing too, right?[lr]::
38023::$$$message_0328_0008_0002$$$::I'm in the same boat. I was forced to be a Master even though I'm not a mage, nor do I really want to fight."::
38024::$$$message_0328_0009_0000$$$::"So at the moment, I'm trying to find a way to get through this without fighting anybody. I have no intention of starting something with you."::
38025::$$$message_0328_0010_0000$$$::"...I see. Then what's up with that Bounded Field? You're saying you don't want to fight even though you have that thing set up?"::
38026::$$$message_0328_0011_0000$$$::"Dumbass, that's for my protection. Tohsaka's at this school, and she's a mage through and through.[lr]::
38027::$$$message_0328_0011_0001$$$::She won't hesitate to fight. So as a Master that's not a mage, I have to set up protection for myself.[lr]::
38028::$$$message_0328_0011_0002$$$::That's all that that Bounded Field was. I won't activate it as long as I don't get attacked.::
38029::$$$message_0328_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38030::$$$message_0328_0012_0001$$$::...His story makes sense.[lr]::
38031::$$$message_0328_0012_0002$$$::I still don't know the details behind whether Shinji really is a Master or not, or how he got to this point.[lr]::
38032::$$$message_0328_0012_0003$$$::But for now, I'll buy it.[lr]::
38033::$$$message_0328_0012_0004$$$::If Shinji says so, I should give him the benefit of the doubt.[lr]::
38034::$$$message_0328_0012_0005$$$::But, before that...::
38035::$$$message_0328_0013_0000$$$::"Shinji. Are you the one who attacked the female student yesterday?"[lr]::
38036::$$$message_0328_0013_0001$$$::I need to solve this problem.::
38037::$$$message_0328_0014_0000$$$::"...Oh, yesterday? I couldn't help it.[lr]::
38038::$$$message_0328_0014_0001$$$::My Servant is an unmanageable woman, and she attacks people if I let her be.[lr]::
38039::$$$message_0328_0014_0002$$$::I'm just a normal person who was chosen to be a Master. I'm not like Tohsaka where it's my main job, so it's hard for me to get her to listen to my orders."::
38040::$$$message_0328_0015_0000$$$::"...Then what happened yesterday was just an accident, right? Your Servant did it herself?"::
38041::$$$message_0328_0016_0000$$$::"Yeah, I'll be careful from now on. I don't want to cause any incidents in my own neighborhood either. I'll make sure the only thing she does is protect me."::
38042::$$$message_0328_0017_0000$$$::"...You swear that's true, Shinji?"::
38043::$$$message_0328_0018_0000$$$::"Yeah. Why would I lie? I could've hidden it, but I told you about it.[lr]::
38044::$$$message_0328_0018_0001$$$::You were getting suspicious of me, right? I'll have to defend myself if you come at me, so I came out before that could happen.[lr]::
38045::$$$message_0328_0018_0002$$$::    I don't want to fight anybody."::
38046::$$$message_0328_0019_0000$$$::...I can't take what he says at full value.[lr]::
38047::$$$message_0328_0019_0001$$$::But, if he really does want to avoid fighting... Everything would work out.::
38048::$$$message_0328_0020_0000$$$::"Okay, I'll believe you. If you're not going to do anything, I won't do anything to you either. That work for you?"::
38049::$$$message_0328_0021_0000$$$::"Good, you're being reasonable for once.[lr]::
38050::$$$message_0328_0021_0001$$$::But not good enough. Can't you tell why I came here to talk?"::
38051::$$$message_0328_0022_0000$$$::Shinji holds out his hand, as if he wants to shake hands.[lr]::
38052::$$$message_0328_0022_0001$$$::So that means...::
38053::$$$message_0328_0023_0000$$$::"Do you want to cooperate with me, Emiya? You probably didn't know, but the Matous are a family of mages.[lr]::
38054::$$$message_0328_0023_0001$$$::...Well, it ended with my father's generation, but we still have the knowledge. How does it sound? I'll be helpful to an inexperienced Master like you, right?"::
38055::$$$message_0328_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38056::$$$message_0328_0024_0001$$$::The Matou line is a family of mages...?[lr]::
38057::$$$message_0328_0024_0002$$$::Tohsaka didn't say such a thing.[lr]::
38058::$$$message_0328_0024_0003$$$::No, she must've excluded him as an outsider if the blood died out just as Shinji said.::
38059::$$$message_0328_0025_0000$$$::"What do you think? If you cooperate with me, we can survive the Holy Grail War without having to rely on Tohsaka. I don't think this is anything you even have to think about."::
38060::$$$message_0328_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38061::$$$message_0328_0026_0001$$$::He holds out his hand.[lr]::
38062::$$$message_0328_0026_0002$$$::...His proposal isn't wrong.[lr]::
38063::$$$message_0328_0026_0003$$$::It makes sense, and it's an option.[lr]::
38064::$$$message_0328_0026_0004$$$::However...::
38065::$$$message_0328_0027_0000$$$::"Shinji. Does Sakura know that you're a Master?"::
38066::$$$message_0328_0028_0000$$$::"Huh? You really are an amateur, Emiya.[lr]::
38067::$$$message_0328_0028_0001$$$::A family of mages like mine only teaches its secrets to the eldest son. The other kids are no more than spares.[lr]::
38068::$$$message_0328_0028_0002$$$::It's a waste of time to teach magecraft to spares like that.[lr]::
38069::$$$message_0328_0028_0003$$$::...Hell if I would teach a simpleton like her the ways of a mage.[lr]::
38070::$$$message_0328_0028_0004$$$::I'm the only one who inherited the Matou's secrets."::
38071::$$$message_0328_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38072::$$$message_0328_0029_0001$$$::I see.[lr]::
38073::$$$message_0328_0029_0002$$$::That's really good.[lr]::
38074::$$$message_0328_0029_0003$$$::Sakura isn't someone who should be involved in all this.[lr]::
38075::$$$message_0328_0029_0004$$$::I need her to be smiling happily in life.::
38076::$$$message_0328_0030_0000$$$::"...Shinji. If you promise not to do anything, then I won't do anything to you either. There isn't a problem with it like that, right?"::
38077::$$$message_0328_0031_0000$$$::"...So you won't cooperate with me?"::
38078::$$$message_0328_0032_0000$$$::"There's no need to, right? If we both aren't going to fight each other, there's no need to cooperate.[lr]::
38079::$$$message_0328_0032_0001$$$::If you only want to protect yourself, then you should have the church take care of you until the Holy Grail War is over. You know that, right?"::
38080::$$$message_0328_0033_0000$$$::"...Oh. What is this, Emiya? Are you actually trying to win this battle to the death?"::
38081::$$$message_0328_0034_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38082::$$$message_0328_0034_0001$$$::...I don't intend to die nor do I want to murder anyone.[lr]::
38083::$$$message_0328_0034_0002$$$::But I'll fight anyone who attacks me, and I can't just ignore those who will try to bring disaster to our town.[lr]::
38084::$$$message_0328_0034_0003$$$::And...::
38085::$$$message_0328_0035_0000$$$::"...I don't plan on killing anyone. But I have to see this Holy Grail thing for myself. In order to do that, I have to survive until the end, right?"[lr]::
38086::$$$message_0328_0035_0001$$$::I turn away from Shinji.::
38087::$$$message_0328_0036_0000$$$::"Is that so? So you're just going to fight, huh?[lr]::
38088::$$$message_0328_0036_0001$$$::Well, it has nothing to do with me, but then you won't involve Sakura in this, right, Emiya?"::
38089::$$$message_0328_0037_0000$$$::"...Obviously not. You're going to hide this from her too, right?"::
38090::$$$message_0328_0038_0000$$$::"Of course. But as her older brother, I can't let my little sister stay at the place of someone who's going to be involved in battles to the death.[lr]::
38091::$$$message_0328_0038_0001$$$::If you're going to fight, I won't let Sakura go out until the Holy Grail War is over. You understand, Emiya?"::
38092::$$$message_0328_0039_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38093::$$$message_0328_0039_0001$$$::...He does have a point.[lr]::
38094::$$$message_0328_0039_0002$$$::As long as I'm fighting alongside Saber, the Emiya household is also dangerous.::
38095::$$$message_0328_0040_0000$$$::"All right, I'll tell Sakura. That's fine, right, Shinji?"::
38096::$$$message_0328_0041_0000$$$::"Okay. So nice of you to look out for your juniors.[lr]::
38097::$$$message_0328_0041_0001$$$::To be honest, I was afraid that you were going to hold her hostage. Well, this solves my most urgent worry." ::
38098::$$$message_0328_0042_0000$$$::"...So we're done talking here. I'm going home then."[lr]::
38099::$$$message_0328_0042_0001$$$::"Yeah, go ahead. But you know right, Emiya? What we discussed here stays between us. I told you my secret since you're my friend. If you tell others, I can't anticipate what I might end up doing either."::
38100::$$$message_0328_0043_0000$$$::That must mean that he'll activate the Bounded Field if I tell Tohsaka about him.::
38101::$$$message_0328_0044_0000$$$::"...Yeah, I won't tell anyone. But it's a different story if Tohsaka finds you herself. I'm going to help Tohsaka as much as I can. I won't stop her from fighting you if she finds out your identity.[lr]::
38102::$$$message_0328_0044_0001$$$::...So if you don't want to be found, you should keep your head down."::
38103::$$$message_0328_0045_0000$$$::I walk to the front gate for real this time.[lr]::
38104::$$$message_0328_0045_0001$$$::The school building in the sunset.[lr]::
38105::$$$message_0328_0045_0002$$$::Shinji sees me off without a word. ::
