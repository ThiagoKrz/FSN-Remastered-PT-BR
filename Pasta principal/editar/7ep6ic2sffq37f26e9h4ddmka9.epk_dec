65934::$$$message_0610_0000_0000$$$::"Now, then..."[lr]::
65935::$$$message_0610_0000_0001$$$::The two sisters leave the dojo and enter the yard.[lr]::
65936::$$$message_0610_0000_0002$$$::"What do you think you're doing, Sakura? I thought you're supposed to be resting in your room because of your health."[lr]::
65937::$$$message_0610_0000_0003$$$::Rin Tohsaka looks down on the girl, with an icy glare, rather than concern.::
65938::$$$message_0610_0001_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
65939::$$$message_0610_0001_0001$$$::Sakura Matou uneasily drops her gaze.[lr]::
65940::$$$message_0610_0001_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65941::$$$message_0610_0001_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65942::$$$message_0610_0001_0004$$$::Neither of them exchange any words.[lr]::
65943::$$$message_0610_0001_0005$$$::Rin sternly scolds Sakura for poking her nose where it doesn't belong,[lr]::
65944::$$$message_0610_0001_0006$$$::while Sakura can't find the will to say anything due to her feelings of indebtedness and inferiority.::
65945::$$$message_0610_0002_0000$$$::"Sakura. If you came to see Emiya because you're worried about him, then go back. If that's your only reason for being here, then I'll pretend this never happened."[lr]::
65946::$$$message_0610_0002_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
65947::$$$message_0610_0002_0002$$$::Sakura trembles slightly.[lr]::
65948::$$$message_0610_0002_0003$$$::The older sister's rebuke is severe.[lr]::
65949::$$$message_0610_0002_0004$$$::She knows full well how insecure and gloomy Sakura is, even as she drives at her.::
65950::$$$message_0610_0003_0000$$$::"That's not it, Nee-san, I just..."[lr]::
65951::$$$message_0610_0003_0001$$$::Even as she feels pressured by Rin, Sakura works up her resolve to stand up to the big sister whom she looks up to so much.[lr]::
65952::$$$message_0610_0003_0002$$$::However...[lr]::
65953::$$$message_0610_0003_0003$$$::"I don't need an explanation. Just go back to your room.[lr]::
65954::$$$message_0610_0003_0004$$$::I'm not letting you into the dojo, no matter what you say."[lr]::
65955::$$$message_0610_0003_0005$$$::Rin cuts her off midsentence.::
65956::$$$message_0610_0004_0000$$$::"What... Why can't I go inside?"[lr]::
65957::$$$message_0610_0004_0001$$$::"It doesn't matter why. When we're acting as Masters, we only see you as our enemy.[lr]::
65958::$$$message_0610_0004_0002$$$::Look, Sakura. You're still Zouken's pawn, even if you're protecting this house with Rider instead of taking part in the war. That's why we can't train him in front of you."::
65959::$$$message_0610_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65960::$$$message_0610_0005_0001$$$::All Sakura can do is stand there and take the cold lecture.[lr]::
65961::$$$message_0610_0005_0002$$$::Rin genuinely believes what she says.[lr]::
65962::$$$message_0610_0005_0003$$$::Unlike Shirou, she's constantly on guard against Zouken's next move.[lr]::
65963::$$$message_0610_0005_0004$$$::Or perhaps,[lr]::
65964::$$$message_0610_0005_0005$$$::she's absolutely sure that Sakura will turn on them.::
65965::$$$message_0610_0006_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
65966::$$$message_0610_0006_0001$$$::Sakura bites her lip in frustration.[lr]::
65967::$$$message_0610_0006_0002$$$::As Rin says, they don't know when Zouken will take action.[lr]::
65968::$$$message_0610_0006_0003$$$::With each passing day, her body becomes harder to control, and her memories more scattered.[lr]::
65969::$$$message_0610_0006_0004$$$::Even her sleep is plagued with nightmares and no longer the peaceful respite it once was.[lr]::
65970::$$$message_0610_0006_0005$$$::She could indeed lose her mind at any moment.::
65971::$$$message_0610_0007_0000$$$::"Exactly. You're just causing more trouble for us by moving around when you don't have enough magical energy.[lr]::
65972::$$$message_0610_0007_0001$$$::You might collapse at any time. Okay, you might not right now when nothing's going on, but the more you push yourself, the more Emiya will worry about you.[lr]::
65973::$$$message_0610_0007_0002$$$::...It's just going to stress him out even more. I'm sure you don't want that, Sakura."::
65974::$$$message_0610_0008_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
65975::$$$message_0610_0008_0001$$$::Rin's logic is completely sound.[lr]::
65976::$$$message_0610_0008_0002$$$::Frustrated by her own powerlessness, Sakura stares at the ground again.::
65977::$$$message_0610_0009_0000$$$::"Get it, now? Then hurry up and go back. We'll come get you when it's lunch, so make sure you rest until then."[lr]::
65978::$$$message_0610_0009_0001$$$::She nods meekly.[lr]::
65979::$$$message_0610_0009_0002$$$::Rin turns her back on her little sister.[lr]::
65980::$$$message_0610_0009_0003$$$::The gesture seems to declare that[lr]::
65981::$$$message_0610_0009_0004$$$::Sakura Matou is a nuisance.::
65982::$$$message_0610_0010_0000$$$::"W-wait... Wait, Nee-san!"[lr]::
65983::$$$message_0610_0010_0001$$$::"What? Was there anything else?"[lr]::
65984::$$$message_0610_0010_0002$$$::"Yes. I understand what you're saying. I'm going to go back to my room.[lr]::
65985::$$$message_0610_0010_0003$$$::But, please let me ask a question. What are you going make Senpai do?[lr]::
65986::$$$message_0610_0010_0004$$$::You know he can't fight anymore, don't you?[lr]::
65987::$$$message_0610_0010_0005$$$::Then why did you summon him again today to do even more things to him...!?"::
65988::$$$message_0610_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65989::$$$message_0610_0011_0001$$$::Rin stops in her tracks.::
65990::$$$message_0610_0012_0000$$$::"We're giving him a lecture on magecraft, what else? Right now, we can't beat Zouken, Saber, or that Shadow.[lr]::
65991::$$$message_0610_0012_0001$$$::That's why we need Shirou to draw out Archer's magecraft. Archer's arm contains his accumulated experience. If we loosen the holy shroud, that experience will flow into Shirou even if he's asleep, forcing him to level up."::
65992::$$$message_0610_0013_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
65993::$$$message_0610_0013_0001$$$::Sakura's a mage too, so she understands how reckless of an idea that is.[lr]::
65994::$$$message_0610_0013_0002$$$::What her sister is trying to do to Shirou is nothing but torture,[lr]::
65995::$$$message_0610_0013_0003$$$::like trying to force a hundred liters of fuel into his ten-liter tank.[lr]::
65996::$$$message_0610_0013_0004$$$::Of course, the excess gasoline is bound to spill out, and even if they pour ten thousand points of experience into him, he can only retain ten.::
65997::$$$message_0610_0014_0000$$$::It will only cause him suffering.[lr]::
65998::$$$message_0610_0014_0001$$$::All Shirou will gain is less than a tenth of the agony he's forced to taste.[lr]::
65999::$$$message_0610_0014_0002$$$::And more importantly, a normal mind could never endure such an experience.[lr]::
66000::$$$message_0610_0014_0003$$$::If a mud doll faces a tidal wave, it will be washed away without a trace.[lr]::
66001::$$$message_0610_0014_0004$$$::That's what it means to loosen that holy shroud.::
66002::$$$message_0610_0015_0000$$$::"That's reckless! If you keep doing that, his body won't last![lr]::
66003::$$$message_0610_0015_0001$$$::No, that's not all! He trusts you! He's letting you do these things to him because of his faith in you.[lr]::
66004::$$$message_0610_0015_0002$$$::But you know him[line2]all it'll take is one word from you to make him take off that shroud!"::
66005::$$$message_0610_0016_0000$$$::"...Sakura."[lr]::
66006::$$$message_0610_0016_0001$$$::She doesn't look down this time.[lr]::
66007::$$$message_0610_0016_0002$$$::Sakura glares defiantly at her sister, her ideal.::
66008::$$$message_0610_0017_0000$$$::"...Yeah. But he's already been taking the shroud off, even though I haven't told him to. I realized that when I was talking to him earlier.[lr]::
66009::$$$message_0610_0017_0001$$$::...Seriously, what's wrong with him? No matter how many times I warn him, he just ends up doing it anyway like it's no big deal."::
66010::$$$message_0610_0018_0000$$$::"Huh? Nee-san?"[lr]::
66011::$$$message_0610_0018_0001$$$::"It's because I know him that I suggested a plan that wouldn't involve him using the arm.[lr]::
66012::$$$message_0610_0018_0002$$$::If he knows that we have a fighting chance even if he doesn't take the shroud off, then he'll barely keep himself in check. So, my job is to have him make us a tool while staying on the right side of that line.[lr]::
66013::$$$message_0610_0018_0003$$$::Once we're finished, Shirou can rest. I'll even confine him and make him behave, and not let him fight again until the Holy Grail War is over."::
66014::$$$message_0610_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
66015::$$$message_0610_0019_0001$$$::Her sister is telling the truth.[lr]::
66016::$$$message_0610_0019_0002$$$::Rin Tohsaka is being as considerate as she can.[lr]::
66017::$$$message_0610_0019_0003$$$::...But that's only within her own heart.[lr]::
66018::$$$message_0610_0019_0004$$$::Sakura is the heir to an equally old lineage, so she knows her sister has other priorities.::
66019::$$$message_0610_0020_0000$$$::"Nee-san. I know that you're worried about Senpai.[lr]::
66020::$$$message_0610_0020_0001$$$::But that's all. Once you realize that your method can't defeat Grandfather, then you're sure to use it.[lr]::
66021::$$$message_0610_0020_0002$$$::You're a Tohsaka mage. If it helps you win...to safeguard the laws that govern mages, you'll use Senpai as a tool if you have to."::
66022::$$$message_0610_0021_0000$$$::It's not a question, just a statement of fact.[lr]::
66023::$$$message_0610_0021_0001$$$::The Tohsaka heiress closes her eyes.[lr]::
66024::$$$message_0610_0021_0002$$$::"...Yes. If this method fails, and Zouken and the Shadow repeat last night's atrocity again...then I'll make Shirou use Archer's arm. It's the obvious choice to make, since all it will cost is his life."[lr]::
66025::$$$message_0610_0021_0003$$$::She lays it out boldly.::
66026::$$$message_0610_0022_0000$$$::"...That's selfish. Senpai has never wanted the Holy Grail. It's just a coincidence that he became a Master! So it's wrong to keep forcing him to fight."[lr]::
66027::$$$message_0610_0022_0001$$$::"...Haah. You seem to have the wrong idea, Sakura."::
66028::$$$message_0610_0023_0000$$$::"Listen. I'm not forcing Shirou to do anything,::
66029::$$$message_0610_0023_0001$$$:: nor do I have the right to order him around. My Archer's arm saved his life.::
66030::$$$message_0610_0023_0002$$$::Since then, he's continued to keep the arm while putting up with its effects.[lr]::
66031::$$$message_0610_0023_0003$$$::So, his life has been mine ever since that moment.[lr]::
66032::$$$message_0610_0023_0004$$$::As long as he has that arm, he's my Archer."::
66033::$$$message_0610_0024_0000$$$::"Do you understand? Shirou's my familiar until this war is over.[lr]::
66034::$$$message_0610_0024_0001$$$::You have no right to interfere with that. I want him to fight, so I'll borrow his power as much as I need to."[lr]::
66035::$$$message_0610_0024_0002$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
66036::$$$message_0610_0024_0003$$$::She can't come up with a retort.[lr]::
66037::$$$message_0610_0024_0004$$$::Awed by her sister's confidence, the girl stands there, unable to say anything in reply.::
66038::$$$message_0610_0025_0000$$$::"...Are we finished here? Then go back to your room. You're being a nuisance by staying here."[lr]::
66039::$$$message_0610_0025_0001$$$::Rin Tohsaka turns and goes back to the dojo.[lr]::
66040::$$$message_0610_0025_0002$$$::The girl watches her go as if gazing at a distant landscape.::
66041::$$$message_0610_0026_0000$$$::...This yard that should be so familiar to her seems huge.[lr]::
66042::$$$message_0610_0026_0001$$$::She feels like there's nothing in it, and nothing she can reach for.[lr]::
66043::$$$message_0610_0026_0002$$$::In the midst of her loneliness,[lr]::
66044::$$$message_0610_0026_0003$$$::"...So you're even going to take Senpai from me, Nee-san."[lr]::
66045::$$$message_0610_0026_0004$$$::she whispers, in an empty voice.:ÂÏq
