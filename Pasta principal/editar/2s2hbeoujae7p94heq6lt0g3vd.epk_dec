74231::$$$message_0681_0000_0001$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
74232::$$$message_0681_0000_0002$$$::The mask falls off the man who was her brother.[lr]::
74233::$$$message_0681_0000_0003$$$::His sticky, plastic smile is gone without a trace.::
74234::$$$message_0681_0001_0000$$$::"You traitor... You disgrace to the Matous...!"[lr]::
74235::$$$message_0681_0001_0001$$$::He screams at her as he closes in.[lr]::
74236::$$$message_0681_0001_0002$$$::The man glowers viciously at the girl, closing in with sluggish yet threatening steps.[lr]::
74237::$$$message_0681_0001_0003$$$::"...!"[lr]::
74238::$$$message_0681_0001_0004$$$::The girl twitches in fright.[lr]::
74239::$$$message_0681_0001_0005$$$::She realizes that he's approaching her with hatred...and bloodlust.::
74240::$$$message_0681_0002_0000$$$::"Ha! That's right, that's how you should be![lr]::
74241::$$$message_0681_0002_0001$$$::It doesn't matter how hard you try to act like a normal person.[lr]::
74242::$$$message_0681_0002_0002$$$::You're a Matou woman. A lowly, cowardly has-been of a mage, no different from an emotionless doll!"[lr]::
74243::$$$message_0681_0002_0003$$$::He roughly moves in.[lr]::
74244::$$$message_0681_0002_0004$$$::"Mm...! No, stop[line2]"[lr]::
74245::$$$message_0681_0002_0005$$$::She retreats.[lr]::
74246::$$$message_0681_0002_0006$$$::A long-lost feeling of superiority brings a smile to the man's face.::
74247::$$$message_0681_0003_0000$$$::And that's why he fails to realize that the girl cowering in front of him[lr]::
74248::$$$message_0681_0003_0001$$$::isn't obedient like she's always been.[lr]::
74249::$$$message_0681_0003_0002$$$::The man is the only one who doesn't see that she's twisting away from him out of sheer revulsion and defiance.::
74250::$$$message_0681_0004_0000$$$::"Hey, you're pretty feisty today... Uh-huh, I see. That's great![lr]::
74251::$$$message_0681_0004_0001$$$::Emiya must be in the dumps right now!"::
74252::$$$message_0681_0005_0000$$$::"No... Stop it, stay away from me, Nii-san...!"[lr]::
74253::$$$message_0681_0005_0001$$$::The girl does everything she can to push the threatening man away.::
74254::$$$message_0681_0006_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
74255::$$$message_0681_0006_0001$$$::He stops.[lr]::
74256::$$$message_0681_0006_0002$$$::His extended hand slightly dips, and he stares down at the girl as if encountering something alien.::
74257::$$$message_0681_0007_0000$$$::"What'd you say? Hey, what'd you just say to me?"[lr]::
74258::$$$message_0681_0007_0001$$$::His voice is shocked.[lr]::
74259::$$$message_0681_0007_0002$$$::The girl gulps and works up the courage to look him in the eyes.::
74260::$$$message_0681_0008_0000$$$::"I-I said to stay away from me. I'm not going to do what you say anymore.[lr]::
74261::$$$message_0681_0008_0001$$$::...Senpai. Senpai accepted me. He said he'll protect me! I'm not your plaything. I'm...!"::
74262::$$$message_0681_0009_0000$$$::The girl desperately tries to squirm out from under the man's oppressive shadow.[lr]::
74263::$$$message_0681_0009_0001$$$::"...The hell?"[lr]::
74264::$$$message_0681_0009_0002$$$::His voice is hollow.[lr]::
74265::$$$message_0681_0009_0003$$$::He stares down at the cowering girl.::
74266::$$$message_0681_0010_0000$$$::"What the hell!? What the hell!? Don't give me that shit!"[lr]::
74267::$$$message_0681_0010_0001$$$::His temper explodes.::
74268::$$$message_0681_0011_0000$$$::"Because of Emiya...!? You won't do what I say!?[lr]::
74269::$$$message_0681_0011_0001$$$::Who the fuck do you think you are!? I'm your big brother, and I make the rules here! You just need to shut up and do what you're told, like always!"[lr]::
74270::$$$message_0681_0011_0002$$$::The dam on his anger has broken, and there's no stopping it.[lr]::
74271::$$$message_0681_0011_0003$$$::His mind can't take the shock of being defied by someone who's never turned on him before.::
74272::$$$message_0681_0012_0000$$$::"Take that back, Sakura! You're mine, and no one else's! Know your place! You're a Matou woman! You don't have the right to say anything to me...!"[lr]::
74273::$$$message_0681_0012_0001$$$::He doesn't know how to stop his anger.[lr]::
74274::$$$message_0681_0012_0002$$$::"                      "[lr]::
74275::$$$message_0681_0012_0003$$$::The girl glares at him reproachfully, with determination in her eyes.::
74276::$$$message_0681_0013_0000$$$::He finds her gaze maddening.[lr]::
74277::$$$message_0681_0013_0001$$$::He doesn't like being stared at so directly.[lr]::
74278::$$$message_0681_0013_0002$$$::At the same time, he laughs at her powerless resistance.[lr]::
74279::$$$message_0681_0013_0003$$$::He laughs.[lr]::
74280::$$$message_0681_0013_0004$$$::He laughs.[lr]::
74281::$$$message_0681_0013_0005$$$::The brother cackles in delight.::
74282::$$$message_0681_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74283::$$$message_0681_0014_0001$$$::That's when she realizes, deep down[lr]::
74284::$$$message_0681_0014_0002$$$::what he's thinking.[lr]::
74285::$$$message_0681_0014_0003$$$::...No matter what,[lr]::
74286::$$$message_0681_0014_0004$$$::he seems determined to ruin my life, just to ridicule me.::
74287::$$$message_0681_0015_0000$$$::"Why..."[lr]::
74288::$$$message_0681_0015_0001$$$::She whimpers.[lr]::
74289::$$$message_0681_0015_0002$$$::Why is he always like this?[lr]::
74290::$$$message_0681_0015_0003$$$::She's put up with so much, for so long.[lr]::
74291::$$$message_0681_0015_0004$$$::She's lied to other people and even herself, trying to convince herself that she could still be happy someday.[lr]::
74292::$$$message_0681_0015_0005$$$::She thought that she was happy just being at Senpai's house.::
74293::$$$message_0681_0016_0000$$$::And yet...[lr]::
74294::$$$message_0681_0016_0001$$$::Why can't he even let her have that?[lr]::
74295::$$$message_0681_0016_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74296::$$$message_0681_0016_0003$$$::...No, he isn't the only one.[lr]::
74297::$$$message_0681_0016_0004$$$::She's always thought...[lr]::
74298::$$$message_0681_0016_0005$$$::Always resented...[lr]::
74299::$$$message_0681_0016_0006$$$::Why?[lr]::
74300::$$$message_0681_0016_0007$$$::Why... Why does the world around me hate me this much?::
74301::$$$message_0681_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74302::$$$message_0681_0017_0001$$$::She can't put any strength into her limbs.[lr]::
74303::$$$message_0681_0017_0002$$$::She doesn't feel like resisting, and the man who calls himself her brother leers down at her.::
74304::$$$message_0681_0018_0000$$$::"Ha...haha, hahahahahahahahahahaha!"[lr]::
74305::$$$message_0681_0018_0001$$$::The girl absently stares up at the man making a smug, sinister expression.[lr]::
74306::$$$message_0681_0018_0002$$$::"...I wish people like this didn't exist."[lr]::
74307::$$$message_0681_0018_0003$$$::Eleven years.[lr]::
74308::$$$message_0681_0018_0004$$$::She thinks something she's never thought before in all that time.::
74309::$$$message_0681_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74310::$$$message_0681_0019_0001$$$::Something whips through the air.[lr]::
74311::$$$message_0681_0019_0002$$$::The man who had been bearing down on her limps over.[lr]::
74312::$$$message_0681_0019_0003$$$::There's a shower of fresh blood.[lr]::
74313::$$$message_0681_0019_0004$$$::The girl rises and looks wordlessly at the man.::
74314::$$$message_0681_0020_0000$$$::"...Ah."[lr]::
74315::$$$message_0681_0020_0001$$$::He died instantly.[lr]::
74316::$$$message_0681_0020_0002$$$::Something incredibly sharp hit him in the head,[lr]::
74317::$$$message_0681_0020_0003$$$::There's some kind of line leading into his cranium.[lr]::
74318::$$$message_0681_0020_0004$$$::Marked by flowing red liquid, the line reached his brain, but it's so thin that nothing leaks from the wound.::
74319::$$$message_0681_0021_0000$$$::"...Oh."[lr]::
74320::$$$message_0681_0021_0001$$$::She feels nothing as she looks down at it.[lr]::
74321::$$$message_0681_0021_0002$$$::The shadow that killed her brother is swaying.[lr]::
74322::$$$message_0681_0021_0003$$$::It's swaying as the gray sunlight illuminates it.[lr]::
74323::$$$message_0681_0021_0004$$$::It's hers.[lr]::
74324::$$$message_0681_0021_0005$$$::Her own sunlit shadow smoothly rises, quivering and swaying.::
74325::$$$message_0681_0022_0000$$$::"...Aahh."[lr]::
74326::$$$message_0681_0022_0001$$$::That's why she's the one who did it.[lr]::
74327::$$$message_0681_0022_0002$$$::She killed her own brother.[lr]::
74328::$$$message_0681_0022_0003$$$::She understands this, but she feels nothing.[lr]::
74329::$$$message_0681_0022_0004$$$::She feels nothing.[lr]::
74330::$$$message_0681_0022_0005$$$::Nothing.[lr]::
74331::$$$message_0681_0022_0006$$$::Nothing.[lr]::
74332::$$$message_0681_0022_0007$$$::Nothing.[lr]::
74333::$$$message_0681_0022_0008$$$::Not hatred, nor fear, nor guilt, nor regret.[lr]::
74334::$$$message_0681_0022_0009$$$::The only thought in her empty mind is how easy it was.::
74335::$$$message_0681_0023_0000$$$::"...Ahhh, ahh..."[lr]::
74336::$$$message_0681_0023_0001$$$::This feels familiar.[lr]::
74337::$$$message_0681_0023_0002$$$::It isn't the first time.[lr]::
74338::$$$message_0681_0023_0003$$$::She's dreamed about it plenty of times.[lr]::
74339::$$$message_0681_0023_0004$$$::Maybe she learned by example because she saw it in her dreams. [font italic=true]In her dreams.[font italic=false]::
74340::$$$message_0681_0024_0000$$$::"...Ah, ha."[lr]::
74341::$$$message_0681_0024_0001$$$::She's not sure.[lr]::
74342::$$$message_0681_0024_0002$$$::But she should have done this sooner.[lr]::
74343::$$$message_0681_0024_0003$$$::If it wasn't going to feel like anything, then she should have done this a lot sooner.[lr]::
74344::$$$message_0681_0024_0004$$$::"That's right," she thinks.[lr]::
74345::$$$message_0681_0024_0005$$$::"...Heh...Heheh."[lr]::
74346::$$$message_0681_0024_0006$$$::Her supposedly absent emotions whisper that it was fun.::
74347::$$$message_0681_0025_0000$$$::It was fun.[lr]::
74348::$$$message_0681_0025_0001$$$::It was fun.[lr]::
74349::$$$message_0681_0025_0002$$$::It was fun...?[lr]::
74350::$$$message_0681_0025_0003$$$::Not "it is fun," but "it [font italic=true]was[font italic=false] fun?"::
74351::$$$message_0681_0026_0000$$$::When?[lr]::
74352::$$$message_0681_0026_0001$$$::Where?[lr]::
74353::$$$message_0681_0026_0002$$$::What?::
74354::$$$message_0681_0027_0000$$$::Dream.[lr]::
74355::$$$message_0681_0027_0001$$$::In a dream.[lr]::
74356::$$$message_0681_0027_0002$$$::Oh, right. I'm not dreaming.[lr]::
74357::$$$message_0681_0027_0003$$$::Yeah, that dream...::
74358::$$$message_0681_0028_0000$$$::It isn't a dream.[lr]::
74359::$$$message_0681_0028_0001$$$::The person that goes out every night and kills all the men who approach her is none other than herself.[lr]::
74360::$$$message_0681_0028_0002$$$::She killed a lot of them.[lr]::
74361::$$$message_0681_0028_0003$$$::So, so many.[lr]::
74362::$$$message_0681_0028_0004$$$::I did it. I killed them all while laughing...!::
74363::$$$message_0681_0029_0000$$$::"...Aha. Ahaha. Ahahaha."[lr]::
74364::$$$message_0681_0029_0001$$$::It's hilarious.[lr]::
74365::$$$message_0681_0029_0002$$$::If she doesn't laugh, she'll break.[lr]::
74366::$$$message_0681_0029_0003$$$::She can't take this unless she laughs.[lr]::
74367::$$$message_0681_0029_0004$$$::But the more she laughs, the more she falls apart, and her tears won't stop, and nothing starts to matter anymore.::
74368::$$$message_0681_0030_0000$$$::"Haha! Ahaha, hahahahahahahahahaha!"[lr]::
74369::$$$message_0681_0030_0001$$$::It's so funny that it makes her stomach hurt.[lr]::
74370::$$$message_0681_0030_0002$$$::The more she laughs, the stupider she gets.[lr]::
74371::$$$message_0681_0030_0003$$$::But it feels so good, and it comes out so easily.[lr]::
74372::$$$message_0681_0030_0004$$$::Ahh, how silly, how absurd, how foolish she is...!::
74373::$$$message_0681_0031_0000$$$::"...Heh. ...Heheh, ah."[lr]::
74374::$$$message_0681_0031_0001$$$::Her smile twitches.[lr]::
74375::$$$message_0681_0031_0002$$$::Sweet, twinkling chuckles escape her lips in place of her now-motionless brother.::
74376::$$$message_0681_0032_0000$$$::...And then, after playing with her brother's body for a while, moving it around like a child playing house,[lr]::
74377::$$$message_0681_0032_0001$$$::she finally gets up from the bed.[lr]::
74378::$$$message_0681_0032_0002$$$::She stands in front of the mirror, looking at her blood-stained figure.[lr]::
74379::$$$message_0681_0032_0003$$$::   The shadow that's killed so many is standing behind her.::
74380::$$$message_0681_0033_0000$$$::Her shadow.[lr]::
74381::$$$message_0681_0033_0001$$$::Her dark self that's eaten dozens of people.[lr]::
74382::$$$message_0681_0033_0002$$$::She tried so hard to control herself so that this wouldn't happen.[lr]::
74383::$$$message_0681_0033_0003$$$::Someone stayed by her side so that this wouldn't happen.[lr]::
74384::$$$message_0681_0033_0004$$$::She laughs scornfully.[lr]::
74385::$$$message_0681_0033_0005$$$::There had never been any point to it from the beginning.::
74386::$$$message_0681_0034_0000$$$::"...Oh. Looks like I've been slowly going crazy all along."[lr]::
74387::$$$message_0681_0034_0001$$$::She twirls in front of the mirror.[lr]::
74388::$$$message_0681_0034_0002$$$::A proud smile adorns her lips.[lr]::
74389::$$$message_0681_0034_0003$$$::"Look, Senpai. I've always been broken."[lr]::
74390::$$$message_0681_0034_0004$$$::She says in the same tone one might use to ask for a dance.::
74391::$$$message_0681_0035_0000$$$::The girl's mind ended there.[lr]::
74392::$$$message_0681_0035_0001$$$::It was replaced, to be precise.[lr]::
74393::$$$message_0681_0035_0002$$$::Her subconscious which she had always kept a lid on simply emerged.::
74394::$$$message_0681_0036_0000$$$::There's someone else she's speaking to, as well.[lr]::
74395::$$$message_0681_0036_0001$$$::Behind the girl,[lr]::
74396::$$$message_0681_0036_0002$$$::in the deep darkness, he reveals only his presence.::
74397::$$$message_0681_0037_0000$$$::"...You've killed many people, Sakura."[lr]::
74398::$$$message_0681_0037_0001$$$::The girl doesn't answer.[lr]::
74399::$$$message_0681_0037_0002$$$::She doesn't even need to nod.::
74400::$$$message_0681_0038_0000$$$::"You can no longer live as a human."[lr]::
74401::$$$message_0681_0038_0001$$$::She doesn't answer.[lr]::
74402::$$$message_0681_0038_0002$$$::That isn't worth responding to, either.::
74403::$$$message_0681_0039_0000$$$::"Now, accept your shadow. Nobody can stop you now. Seize the Einzbern girl and acquire the Holy Grail. You have no other way to survive."[lr]::
74404::$$$message_0681_0039_0001$$$::"Yes. As you say, Grandfather."[lr]::
74405::$$$message_0681_0039_0002$$$::She nods quietly.[lr]::
74406::$$$message_0681_0039_0003$$$::Does she anticipate the work to come, or[lr]::
74407::$$$message_0681_0039_0004$$$::does she merely want to flee from him?[lr]::
74408::$$$message_0681_0039_0005$$$::She doesn't know her own heart anymore.::
74409::$$$message_0681_0040_0000$$$::All she knows is that the moment she accepted her shadow, all the pain she'd ever felt vanished like a dream.[lr]::
74410::$$$message_0681_0040_0001$$$::...It creeps up her body.[lr]::
74411::$$$message_0681_0040_0002$$$::Starting with her feet, the black mud coats her skin.[lr]::
74412::$$$message_0681_0040_0003$$$::The pain becomes fire, and it burns her skin.[lr]::
74413::$$$message_0681_0040_0004$$$::Like a curse.[lr]::
74414::$$$message_0681_0040_0005$$$::Her pale skin turns into something else.::
74415::$$$message_0681_0041_0000$$$::"Yes, with this..."[lr]::
74416::$$$message_0681_0041_0001$$$::She won't lose to anyone ever again.[lr]::
74417::$$$message_0681_0041_0002$$$::No one can stop her.[lr]::
74418::$$$message_0681_0041_0003$$$::She knows for a fact that she's the strongest fighter in this war.[lr]::
74419::$$$message_0681_0041_0004$$$::She'll defeat everyone who's threatened her, just as she always imagined.::
74420::$$$message_0681_0042_0000$$$::"Mm..."[lr]::
74421::$$$message_0681_0042_0001$$$::She trembles.[lr]::
74422::$$$message_0681_0042_0002$$$::The thought alone fills her with unexpected joy.[lr]::
74423::$$$message_0681_0042_0003$$$::In the midst of her rapture, one name repeatedly comes to mind.[lr]::
74424::$$$message_0681_0042_0004$$$::Rin Tohsaka, the family member she loves and respects the most.֘G
