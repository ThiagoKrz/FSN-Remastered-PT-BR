65738::$$$message_0607_0000_0000$$$::It's an earnest plea, not a warning.::
65739::$$$message_0607_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65740::$$$message_0607_0001_0001$$$::I squeeze my wrapped left arm.[lr]::
65741::$$$message_0607_0001_0002$$$::It's true that I don't want to take this off.[lr]::
65742::$$$message_0607_0001_0003$$$::But that means...::
65743::$$$message_0607_0002_0000$$$::"How am I going to copy Archer's magecraft, then?[lr]::
65744::$$$message_0607_0002_0001$$$::I won't be able to draw out its structure unless I undo the shroud, right?"::
65745::$$$message_0607_0003_0000$$$::"Of course. We're going to keep the risks in mind and just barely loosen the holy shroud's restraints. It won't fully undo the seal, and it should reduce the feedback from his arm."[lr]::
65746::$$$message_0607_0003_0001$$$::"...Right, when you were talking about taking off the shroud earlier..."::
65747::$$$message_0607_0004_0000$$$::"I meant that we'd just slightly loosen it.[lr]::
65748::$$$message_0607_0004_0001$$$::But it's still a big deal, so I wanted to make sure you were ready."::
65749::$$$message_0607_0005_0000$$$::"It's something we have to do eventually, anyway.[lr]::
65750::$$$message_0607_0005_0001$$$::You don't want to keep your arm wrapped up forever, do you? You won't get anywhere if you can't at least take it off and put it back on yourself. What if it accidentally comes off in the bath, for example?"[lr]::
65751::$$$message_0607_0005_0002$$$::"Oh. Yeah, good point."::
65752::$$$message_0607_0006_0000$$$::"Right? So we should teach you to bear the feedback of loosening the shroud, at least.[lr]::
65753::$$$message_0607_0006_0001$$$::It looks like your body's adapting to the ward I applied yesterday and the magic resistance is working. Illya will protect your mind, so I think we should have about five minutes to work with."::
65754::$$$message_0607_0007_0000$$$::"So you mean...you want the two of us to restrain Archer's arm?"::
65755::$$$message_0607_0008_0000$$$::"Not exactly. I'm only going to be protecting your mind, while it's your job to endure the backflow from Archer's arm.[lr]::
65756::$$$message_0607_0008_0001$$$::You need to draw out Archer's experience, so you'll have to accept and endure it instead of blocking it out."::
65757::$$$message_0607_0009_0000$$$::...I see.[lr]::
65758::$$$message_0607_0009_0001$$$::If Illya blocks the magical energy flow from Archer's arm, I won't be able to learn his magecraft.[lr]::
65759::$$$message_0607_0009_0002$$$::Even if it's toxic to me, I can't learn what it contains unless I taste it myself.::
65760::$$$message_0607_0010_0000$$$::"...All right. Then I'll loosen the shroud, and do my best to endure the backflow from the arm."::
65761::$$$message_0607_0011_0000$$$::"Yeah. When you do it, close your eyes and direct your mind inwards.[lr]::
65762::$$$message_0607_0011_0001$$$::It should be easy, like when you're opening your Magic Circuits.[lr]::
65763::$$$message_0607_0011_0002$$$::You just need to experience Archer's Projection method. Let it sink into your body, but don't try to understand it."::
65764::$$$message_0607_0012_0000$$$::"...Sorry, I need to step away for a bit.[lr]::
65765::$$$message_0607_0012_0001$$$::Take care of him, Illya. I'll be right back, so train him in the meantime."[lr]::
65766::$$$message_0607_0012_0002$$$::And with that, Tohsaka suddenly leaves the dojo,[lr]::
65767::$$$message_0607_0012_0003$$$::though not with any urgency.::
65768::$$$message_0607_0013_0000$$$::"What's up with her?"[lr]::
65769::$$$message_0607_0013_0001$$$::"Who knows. She probably forgot something.[lr]::
65770::$$$message_0607_0013_0002$$$::Anyway, Shirou, you have something to do, don't you?[lr]::
65771::$$$message_0607_0013_0003$$$::I think it's foolish to loosen the binds, and I'm against it. But I did promise to help you. We'll finish this before Rin gets back."::
65772::$$$message_0607_0014_0000$$$::Illya goes behind me and places a cool hand on my back.::
65773::$$$message_0607_0015_0000$$$::"Illya...?"[lr]::
65774::$$$message_0607_0015_0001$$$::"Just close your eyes. Do that meditation you're so good at.[lr]::
65775::$$$message_0607_0015_0002$$$::Once you open your Magic Circuits, I'll protect your mind, and then loosen the holy shroud.[lr]::
65776::$$$message_0607_0015_0003$$$::I'll handle the timing, so just be ready to deal with the magical energy flow. You'll need to try as hard as you can to hang on, because the feedback from the arm will consume you."::
65777::$$$message_0607_0016_0000$$$::I nod, and slowly close my eyes.::
65778::$$$message_0607_0017_0000$$$::...Quickly and quietly, I still my mind and create different nerves inside my body.[lr]::
65779::$$$message_0607_0017_0001$$$::In just a few days, it's become much easier to create my pseudo-nerves.[lr]::
65780::$$$message_0607_0017_0002$$$::Then, just as I complete the line of light running down my back...::
65781::$$$message_0607_0018_0000$$$::"It was a needless warning, Shirou.[lr]::
65782::$$$message_0607_0018_0001$$$::Rin only knows about your human pain of having a Heroic Spirit's arm attached. She doesn't understand what it really means, or what's going to happen to you.[lr]::
65783::$$$message_0607_0018_0002$$$::But she can't help what she doesn't know.[lr]::
65784::$$$message_0607_0018_0003$$$::After all, I'm the only person in the whole world who knows your relationship to Archer."::
65785::$$$message_0607_0019_0000$$$::Illya says something strange in a voice I can't quite hear.::
