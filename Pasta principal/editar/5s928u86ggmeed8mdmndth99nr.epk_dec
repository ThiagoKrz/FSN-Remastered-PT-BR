37470::$$$message_0321_0000_0000$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
37471::$$$message_0321_0000_0001$$$::I should go check on Sakura before the sun sets.::
37472::$$$message_0321_0001_0000$$$::"Fuji-nee, I'm going out for a bit. I don't know what you're up to, but I'll leave dinner to you."[lr]::
37473::$$$message_0321_0001_0001$$$::"Okay, take care. Dinner's going to be delicious crab egg foo young."[lr]::
37474::$$$message_0321_0001_0002$$$::Crab egg foo young, huh?[lr]::
37475::$$$message_0321_0001_0003$$$::Well, I guess even Fuji-nee should be able to make that.::
37476::$$$message_0321_0002_0000$$$::I head up the hill as the sun sets.[lr]::
37477::$$$message_0321_0002_0001$$$::As it's still winter, it's setting early.[lr]::
37478::$$$message_0321_0002_0002$$$::I need to hurry and go to the Matou household so I can check up on Sakura.::
37479::$$$message_0321_0003_0000$$$::"Oh, Senpai? Why are you here at this time?"[lr]::
37480::$$$message_0321_0003_0001$$$::"Oh... Well, I just felt like it. I was just passing by, so I thought I'd drop in."[lr]::
37481::$$$message_0321_0003_0002$$$::"Passing by? Okay, whatever you say."::
37482::$$$message_0321_0004_0000$$$::My flustered state must've been funny, as Sakura smiles.[lr]::
37483::$$$message_0321_0004_0001$$$::Her expression is genuine, and it doesn't look like she's been harassed by Shinji.::
37484::$$$message_0321_0005_0000$$$::"Sakura. I really don't have any business here, but what's Shinji doing?[lr]::
37485::$$$message_0321_0005_0001$$$::Is he home right now?"[lr]::
37486::$$$message_0321_0005_0002$$$::"No, I don't think he's home yet."::
37487::$$$message_0321_0006_0000$$$::"...Not home yet...? Then who called my house? Didn't Shinji tell you to come back here?"[lr]::
37488::$$$message_0321_0006_0001$$$::Huh...? Well, Ms. Fujimura just told me to go home since my grandfather was waiting, so I'm not sure...::
37489::$$$message_0321_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
37490::$$$message_0321_0007_0001$$$::I see.[lr]::
37491::$$$message_0321_0007_0002$$$::...But it is true that Shinji hasn't talked to Sakura at all.[lr]::
37492::$$$message_0321_0007_0003$$$::Shinji's her brother after all.[lr]::
37493::$$$message_0321_0007_0004$$$::He would never involve such a good sister in this battle between Masters.::
37494::$$$message_0321_0008_0000$$$::...And there's one thing I have to tell her so I don't involve her in this mess.::
37495::$$$message_0321_0010_0000$$$::We stare at each other blankly. [lr]::
37496::$$$message_0321_0010_0001$$$::Ten seconds pass with us just goofily staring at each other.::
37497::$$$message_0321_0011_0000$$$::"U-um... I'm a bit disappointed, but I'm relieved to hear that from you. I was told to stay at home and not go anywhere at night for a while."::
37498::$$$message_0321_0012_0000$$$::"Y-yeah, that's right. It's been dangerous lately, so we should've done so earlier... See you, Sakura."::
37499::$$$message_0321_0013_0000$$$::"Yes. I will refrain from going to your house for a while.[lr]::
37500::$$$message_0321_0013_0001$$$::I'm a little disappointed, but I suppose things will return to normal eventually. Until then, please come visit the kyudo club, Senpai."::
37501::$$$message_0321_0014_0000$$$::Sakura bows and goes back into her house.::
37502::$$$message_0321_0015_0000$$$::I manage to make it back before dinner.[lr]::
37503::$$$message_0321_0015_0001$$$::I tell Saber, who was angrily waiting for me at the entrance, about what happened today and how we eliminated the Bounded Field at school, as well as Tohsaka anticipating a counterattack tomorrow.::
37504::$$$message_0321_0016_0000$$$::...I don't tell her about Shinji.[lr]::
37505::$$$message_0321_0016_0001$$$::I don't want her to consider him an enemy until his true intentions are clear.::
37506::$$$message_0321_0017_0000$$$::"I understand. Then let us eat, Shirou. Taiga has made dinner and has been waiting."[lr]::
37507::$$$message_0321_0017_0001$$$::She must be hungry, as Saber makes her way quickly to the living room.::
37508::$$$message_0321_0018_0000$$$::"I see. I haven't eaten anything she's made since I was a kid."[lr]::
37509::$$$message_0321_0018_0001$$$::I'm half worried and half looking forward to it.::
37510::$$$message_0321_0019_0000$$$::...Man.[lr]::
37511::$$$message_0321_0019_0001$$$::Who would have imagined that it was going to turn into such a disaster...?::
90008::$$$message_0321_9999_0000$$$::"...That's a relief. On that note, Sakura, I would appreciate it if you stopped helping for a while."::
90009::$$$message_0321_9999_0001$$$::"Um, Senpai? I know this is sudden, but I won't be able to help you for a little while..."::
90010::$$$message_0321_9999_0002$$$::"Hm?"::
90011::$$$message_0321_9999_0003$$$::"Huh?"::
