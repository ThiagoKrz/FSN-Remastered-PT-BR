33680::$$$message_0271_0000_0001$$$::Everyone watches in astonishment.[lr]::
33681::$$$message_0271_0000_0002$$$::It's not just me and Tohsaka.[lr]::
33682::$$$message_0271_0000_0003$$$::Even Caster, who ought to have been thrilled by a turn in her favor, stares at her own Master in wonder.::
33683::$$$message_0271_0001_0000$$$::Saber's swift attack to Kuzuki's counterattack.[lr]::
33684::$$$message_0271_0001_0001$$$::From the nightmare-like neck grab to the impressive throw, it was all incredible, even to the losing side.::
33685::$$$message_0271_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33686::$$$message_0271_0002_0001$$$::Saber doesn't move.[lr]::
33687::$$$message_0271_0002_0002$$$::She was thrown by her neck and smashed back-first into the wall.[lr]::
33688::$$$message_0271_0002_0003$$$::Her neck injury must be fatal.[lr]::
33689::$$$message_0271_0002_0004$$$::On top of that, she hit the wall at a speed that was clearly meant to finish her.::
33690::$$$message_0271_0003_0000$$$::   I don't think it killed her, but I'm sure she can't move.[lr]::
33691::$$$message_0271_0003_0001$$$::At the least, she'll be laying on the ground until the wounds on her neck and bruises all over her body heal.::
33692::$$$message_0271_0004_0000$$$::"No..."[lr]::
33693::$$$message_0271_0004_0001$$$::I murmur without realizing.[lr]::
33694::$$$message_0271_0004_0002$$$::Even though his fists were Strengthened by Caster's magecraft, Kuzuki's body is still human.[lr]::
33695::$$$message_0271_0004_0003$$$::Who would think that he would be able to overwhelm a Servant in melee combat?::
33696::$$$message_0271_0005_0000$$$::"It's fine to assume that a Master's role is to provide support from the rear."[lr]::
33697::$$$message_0271_0005_0001$$$::The lean figure turns.[lr]::
33698::$$$message_0271_0005_0002$$$::"But there are always exceptions. There are also Masters like me that have no choice but to take the vanguard."::
33699::$$$message_0271_0006_0000$$$::He just proved that to us just now.[lr]::
33700::$$$message_0271_0006_0001$$$::Therefore, these two are...[lr]::
33701::$$$message_0271_0006_0002$$$::Their fighting roles as Master and Servant are completely swapped...!::
33702::$$$message_0271_0007_0000$$$::"What are you doing, Caster? I told you beforehand.[lr]::
33703::$$$message_0271_0007_0001$$$::If you are going to support me, you must take care of the enemy's projectile weapons."::
33704::$$$message_0271_0008_0000$$$::The enemy... Kuzuki stares at Tohsaka.[lr]::
33705::$$$message_0271_0008_0001$$$::Saber is less of a threat to him than Tohsaka, who can attack at a distance.[lr]::
33706::$$$message_0271_0008_0002$$$::So Kuzuki is wary of targeting us.[lr]::
33707::$$$message_0271_0008_0003$$$::He feels that mages ought to battle other mages.::
33708::$$$message_0271_0009_0000$$$::"What happened, Caster? I said that you can do as you wish."[lr]::
33709::$$$message_0271_0009_0001$$$::"...No, I will take care of Saber. Souichirou, please take care of the remaining Masters."[lr]::
33710::$$$message_0271_0009_0002$$$::"..."::
33711::$$$message_0271_0010_0000$$$::He nods silently and walks towards us.[lr]::
33712::$$$message_0271_0010_0001$$$::Behind him, Caster faces the collapsed Saber.::
33713::$$$message_0271_0011_0000$$$::"...Bring it on. Saber was taken aback, but now we know how he fights. We just have to beat him before he gets close to us."::
33714::$$$message_0271_0012_0000$$$::Tohsaka slowly retreats, glaring at Kuzuki.[lr]::
33715::$$$message_0271_0012_0001$$$::   A fight between a mage and a warrior is a fight for distance. [lr]::
33716::$$$message_0271_0012_0002$$$::No matter how many monstrous fighting techniques he may have, Kuzuki has no Magic Resistance.::
33717::$$$message_0271_0013_0000$$$::We can win if we can land a hit at range.[lr]::
33718::$$$message_0271_0013_0001$$$::Victory is ours if we can manage to cast a spell before he reaches us.::
33719::$$$message_0271_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33720::$$$message_0271_0014_0001$$$::Kuzuki faces Tohsaka and doesn't move.[lr]::
33721::$$$message_0271_0014_0002$$$::Caster walks towards the wall that Saber was thrown at.::
33722::$$$message_0271_0015_0000$$$::...That action is a mistake.[lr]::
33723::$$$message_0271_0015_0001$$$::There's an opening I can take advantage of, so I'll...[lr]::
