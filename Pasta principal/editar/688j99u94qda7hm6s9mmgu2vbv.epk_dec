42666::$$$message_0376_0000_0000$$$::"...Man."[lr]::
42667::$$$message_0376_0000_0001$$$::I sigh and lean against a sign.[lr]::
42668::$$$message_0376_0000_0002$$$::I searched around until the sun set, and the only thing I found out was how useless I am.::
42669::$$$message_0376_0001_0000$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
42670::$$$message_0376_0001_0001$$$::The wound on my left shoulder is aching.[lr]::
42671::$$$message_0376_0001_0002$$$::I don't know if it's because my bandage is getting loose or if the wound itself opened up.[lr]::
42672::$$$message_0376_0001_0003$$$::...Anyway, I can't waste any more time.[lr]::
42673::$$$message_0376_0001_0004$$$::If I can't find a certain lead, then it'll end up just like last night.::
42674::$$$message_0376_0002_0000$$$::"...Geez, where could she be?"[lr]::
42675::$$$message_0376_0002_0001$$$::...I recall when I parted ways with her last night.[lr]::
42676::$$$message_0376_0002_0002$$$::It's been a day already since she told me exactly what was on her mind, like how I can't fight without Saber or how I should escape to the church.::
42677::$$$message_0376_0003_0000$$$::"...Oh yeah, the church."[lr]::
42678::$$$message_0376_0003_0001$$$::There is a lead.[lr]::
42679::$$$message_0376_0003_0002$$$::I thought about it when I went out to town this morning.[lr]::
42680::$$$message_0376_0003_0003$$$::The supervisor of the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
42681::$$$message_0376_0003_0004$$$::The priest at the church on the hill should know about Tohsaka's whereabouts...::
42682::$$$message_0376_0004_0000$$$::"...It's irritating to go ask for his help, but now's not the time to be picky..."::
42683::$$$message_0376_0005_0000$$$::...No, whether I like him or not, I shouldn't go see that priest.[lr]::
42684::$$$message_0376_0005_0001$$$::He says he's a priest, but there's something unsettling about him that tells me Kirei Kotomine is a man that fundamentally shouldn't be approached.[lr]::
42685::$$$message_0376_0005_0002$$$::I don't want to have to ask for his advice if possible, but he's the only one I can rely on.::
42686::$$$message_0376_0006_0000$$$::"...It's just once. That shouldn't be a problem."[lr]::
42687::$$$message_0376_0006_0001$$$::I tell myself and move my aching body.[lr]::
42688::$$$message_0376_0006_0002$$$::It's 7 PM.::
42689::$$$message_0376_0007_0000$$$::I walk to the train station for twenty minutes.[lr]::
42690::$$$message_0376_0007_0001$$$::The church stands in the suburbs, away from the noisy town.[lr]::
42691::$$$message_0376_0007_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42692::$$$message_0376_0007_0003$$$::It's been nine days since I last went up this hill.[lr]::
42693::$$$message_0376_0007_0004$$$::However, considering the fact that I had never come here prior to that, I'm coming here quite often now.::
42694::$$$message_0376_0008_0000$$$::...To be honest, I don't like that church.[lr]::
42695::$$$message_0376_0008_0001$$$::Maybe more than Kirei Kotomine, that church itself is forbidden territory that should not be approached.[lr]::
42696::$$$message_0376_0008_0002$$$::The fire ten years ago.[lr]::
42697::$$$message_0376_0008_0003$$$::It's because the church, which looked after the children that became orphans, forces me to recall that incident from ten years ago.::
42698::$$$message_0376_0009_0000$$$::I finish going up the hill and go out into the open grounds.[lr]::
42699::$$$message_0376_0009_0001$$$::"...!"[lr]::
42700::$$$message_0376_0009_0002$$$::I suddenly get a headache.[lr]::
42701::$$$message_0376_0009_0003$$$::It's not because of my left shoulder's wound.[lr]::
42702::$$$message_0376_0009_0004$$$::The wound is causing me to have a fever, but it shouldn't give me this stabbing headache.::
42703::$$$message_0376_0010_0000$$$::"Khh..."[lr]::
42704::$$$message_0376_0010_0001$$$::My temple hurts.[lr]::
42705::$$$message_0376_0010_0002$$$::I lose myself and feel a chill, as if my body is going to split in half like a shedding insect.::
42706::$$$message_0376_0011_0000$$$::"...This is weird."[lr]::
42707::$$$message_0376_0011_0001$$$::I fight through my headache and start running.[lr]::
42708::$$$message_0376_0011_0002$$$::The cause is the hunch I have had since yesterday.[lr]::
42709::$$$message_0376_0011_0003$$$::The unknown feeling that Tohsaka is in Shinto.[lr]::
42710::$$$message_0376_0011_0004$$$::That has expanded to the max and is causing this headache.[lr]::
42711::$$$message_0376_0011_0005$$$::Then... There is no doubt that something is going on in there...::
42712::$$$message_0376_0012_0000$$$::There are bloodstains on the floor.[lr]::
42713::$$$message_0376_0012_0001$$$::The traces of blood sporadically continue up to the door at the back of the church.[lr]::
42714::$$$message_0376_0012_0002$$$::"...No, that's not it. It's not continuing into the back, but it seems like it's coming out from the back."::
42715::$$$message_0376_0013_0000$$$::...It bothers me, but now is not the time for that.[lr]::
42716::$$$message_0376_0013_0001$$$::The bloodstains mean that someone is hurt.[lr]::
42717::$$$message_0376_0013_0002$$$::And this much too... Their life must be in danger.[lr]::
42718::$$$message_0376_0013_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42719::$$$message_0376_0013_0004$$$::I feel a sharp pain in my head. A dull heaviness settles into my body.[lr]::
42720::$$$message_0376_0013_0005$$$::I ignore them as I take out my bamboo sword and start walking quietly.::
42721::$$$message_0376_0014_0000$$$::"Tohsaka... Are you there?"[lr]::
42722::$$$message_0376_0014_0001$$$::Nobody replies.[lr]::
42723::$$$message_0376_0014_0002$$$::The air is tense.[lr]::
42724::$$$message_0376_0014_0003$$$::I feel like all the windows in the church would shatter if I raised my voice.::
42725::$$$message_0376_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42726::$$$message_0376_0015_0001$$$::I follow the traces of blood.[lr]::
42727::$$$message_0376_0015_0002$$$::The bloodstains are in the crevices of the building.[lr]::
42728::$$$message_0376_0015_0003$$$::It continues to the dark staircase that you would miss if you didn't know about it.::
42729::$$$message_0376_0016_0000$$$::"...Stairs that lead underground... I didn't know this place had a basement." [lr]::
42730::$$$message_0376_0016_0001$$$::[font italic=true]This is a church, so could it be a mausoleum?[font italic=false][lr]::
42731::$$$message_0376_0016_0002$$$::"Guh..."[lr]::
42732::$$$message_0376_0016_0003$$$::...I can't afford to be leisurely pondering right now.[lr]::
42733::$$$message_0376_0016_0004$$$::I exercise utmost caution and step into the darkness.::
42734::$$$message_0376_0017_0000$$$::I descend in the darkness.[lr]::
42735::$$$message_0376_0017_0001$$$::...There is a dim light at the end of the stairs.[lr]::
42736::$$$message_0376_0017_0002$$$::I hold my breath and move forward, using only the light below as a guide.::
42737::$$$message_0376_0018_0000$$$::The narrow corridor ends, and I come out to an open space.[lr]::
42738::$$$message_0376_0018_0001$$$::It is a spacious stone chamber.[lr]::
42739::$$$message_0376_0018_0002$$$::The stairs along the wall stretch down to the sanctuary.[lr]::
42740::$$$message_0376_0018_0003$$$::There, stairs lead to an open space that seems like the sanctuary,::
42741::$$$message_0376_0018_0004$$$::and there... is the one I had been looking for, Rin Tohsaka.::
42742::$$$message_0376_0019_0000$$$::Tohsaka is confronting the enemy in front of her, with Archer protecting her.[lr]::
42743::$$$message_0376_0019_0001$$$::In front of her... In front of the altar are two silhouettes.::
42744::$$$message_0376_0020_0000$$$::It doesn't even have to be said.[lr]::
42745::$$$message_0376_0020_0001$$$::The mage in the purple robe, Caster, and her Master, Kuzuki.[lr]::
42746::$$$message_0376_0020_0002$$$::On the altar behind them...[lr]::
42747::$$$message_0376_0020_0003$$$::There is Saber, who is looking down and panting painfully.::
42748::$$$message_0376_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42749::$$$message_0376_0021_0001$$$::My heart skips a beat.[lr]::
42750::$$$message_0376_0021_0002$$$::My pulse is clearly beating at a much faster rate.::
42751::$$$message_0376_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42752::$$$message_0376_0022_0001$$$::The situation is obvious.[lr]::
42753::$$$message_0376_0022_0002$$$::The two pairs of Master and Servant confronting each other in the sanctuary about five meters below me.[lr]::
42754::$$$message_0376_0022_0003$$$::They haven't noticed me hiding overhead, as they're too preoccupied.::
42755::$$$message_0376_0023_0000$$$::Tohsaka and Caster are both thinking ahead, looking for an opening to attack.[lr]::
42756::$$$message_0376_0023_0001$$$::To look up in a situation like this would not be allowed.::
42757::$$$message_0376_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42758::$$$message_0376_0024_0001$$$::My heart beats even faster.[lr]::
42759::$$$message_0376_0024_0002$$$::My headache is constant, and I feel an intense pain in my shoulder as if it's been seared by a hot iron.::
42760::$$$message_0376_0025_0000$$$::I can't keep my presence hidden forever in this state.[lr]::
42761::$$$message_0376_0025_0001$$$::Caster or Kuzuki. If one of them looks up even just a bit, they'll notice me hiding.[lr]::
42762::$$$message_0376_0025_0002$$$::I...[lr]::
