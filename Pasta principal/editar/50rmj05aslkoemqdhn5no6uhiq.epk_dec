56425::$$$message_0498_0000_0000$$$::Tohsaka's magical examination ends rather quickly.[lr]::
56426::$$$message_0498_0000_0001$$$::She lit some incense and did something that looked like a tarot card reading. Then, I answered some questions that reminded me of a personality test.::
56427::$$$message_0498_0001_0000$$$::According to her...[lr]::
56428::$$$message_0498_0001_0001$$$::"You don't correspond to anything. I won't bother trying anything else."[lr]::
56429::$$$message_0498_0001_0002$$$::She gives up quickly on trying to identify my Magic Circuits.::
56430::$$$message_0498_0002_0000$$$::"Wow. So you can't tell?"[lr]::
56431::$$$message_0498_0002_0001$$$::I blurt out a question.::
56432::$$$message_0498_0003_0000$$$::"That's rude. I figured out that you don't correspond to any of the Five Great Elements. Any consecration beyond that falls outside of my area of expertise, so there isn't any point in going further, is there?[lr]::
56433::$$$message_0498_0003_0001$$$::Next, show me the magecraft you can use. I can make some estimates based on that."::
56434::$$$message_0498_0004_0000$$$::...So she says.[lr]::
56435::$$$message_0498_0004_0001$$$::Next, I practiced my Strengthening magecraft on the clay lump that Tohsaka gave me.::
56436::$$$message_0498_0005_0000$$$::Clay is a lump of ether, and always returns to being a lump no matter what you do to it, so it's very conducive to magical energy.[lr]::
56437::$$$message_0498_0005_0001$$$::I was a little worried it might get stuck once I Strengthened it, but...::
56438::$$$message_0498_0006_0000$$$::"It's like a shiniku, so don't worry about it. No matter how much energy you cram into it, it'll go back to how it was in a day."[lr]::
56439::$$$message_0498_0006_0001$$$::...so she said.[lr]::
56440::$$$message_0498_0006_0002$$$::By the way, she said a shiniku is a lump of meat that never gets any smaller no matter how much of it you eat. It's called a shirou in Chinese mythology.::
56441::$$$message_0498_0007_0000$$$::...Anyway, I tried Strengthening the lump of clay.[lr]::
56442::$$$message_0498_0007_0001$$$::I didn't want to fail in front of her, but I only managed to pull it off twice in ten attempts.[lr]::
56443::$$$message_0498_0007_0002$$$::It even took me much longer to manifest my Magic Circuit than I did when Saber was still around.::
56444::$$$message_0498_0008_0000$$$::While I practiced Strengthening, Tohsaka asked me questions, such as,[lr]::
56445::$$$message_0498_0008_0001$$$::whether I came up with my own incantation, whether I can use magecraft other than Strengthening, how I was trained, what I form mental images of most easily, and so on.::
56446::$$$message_0498_0009_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
56447::$$$message_0498_0009_0001$$$::Tohsaka's face darkened, until she eventually stopped saying anything.[lr]::
56448::$$$message_0498_0009_0002$$$::I don't know what I did to upset her, but having her make that face this close to mine was very uncomfortable.::
56449::$$$message_0498_0010_0000$$$::"Tohsaka? Um, maybe this is a stupid question, but are you regretting teaming up with me because of how inexperienced I am?"[lr]::
56450::$$$message_0498_0010_0001$$$::I ask her about her most likely concern.::
56451::$$$message_0498_0011_0000$$$::"Huh? Well, yeah but...you aren't just experienced. It's like your way of thinking is incorrect. I'm surprised you've managed to live this long, operating like that."[lr]::
56452::$$$message_0498_0011_0001$$$::Tohsaka muses aloud.::
56453::$$$message_0498_0012_0000$$$::"? Earth to Tohsaka! I don't follow!"[lr]::
56454::$$$message_0498_0012_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
56455::$$$message_0498_0012_0002$$$::Why are you glaring at me like that?::
56456::$$$message_0498_0013_0000$$$::"...Fine. Looks like I'll need to fix you from square one. Going back to what I asked before, do you still have any Projections in your atelier?"[lr]::
56457::$$$message_0498_0013_0001$$$::"Yeah. They stay as long as you don't break them, don't they?"::
56458::$$$message_0498_0014_0000$$$::She asked me that earlier, when I mentioned trying Projection during breaks when Strengthening wasn't going well.[lr]::
56459::$$$message_0498_0014_0001$$$::Tohsaka pressed me hard for details about that and, just once, asked me to Project something using the clay lump.[lr]::
56460::$$$message_0498_0014_0002$$$::She asked me to make an earthenware pot. It went well until about halfway, then it failed.::
56461::$$$message_0498_0015_0000$$$::"Hmph. All right, I'm going to teach you how to flip your switch on and off.[lr]::
56462::$$$message_0498_0015_0001$$$::It's actually a lot faster to create the switch inside your body, so I want you to sleep over tonight. You'll need the sleep after such a rough procedure."::
56463::$$$message_0498_0016_0000$$$::"Wait, sleep over? Here?"[lr]::
56464::$$$message_0498_0016_0001$$$::"Why are you looking at me like that? Don't worry, I won't cut you open with a scalpel. I'm just going to have you swallow something. You won't be able to move for a while because of how strong it is."::
56465::$$$message_0498_0017_0000$$$::"Oh, uh, I wasn't worried about the procedure..."[lr]::
56466::$$$message_0498_0017_0001$$$::...I look at the clock.[lr]::
56467::$$$message_0498_0017_0002$$$::It's already past five o'clock.[lr]::
56468::$$$message_0498_0017_0003$$$::I didn't notice because of the cloudy weather, but it's already evening.::
56469::$$$message_0498_0018_0000$$$::Tohsaka is looking out for me as both an ally and a mage.[lr]::
56470::$$$message_0498_0018_0001$$$::...I'm worried about Sakura, but it shouldn't be a problem to leave her for a day, with the caretaker around.[lr]::
56471::$$$message_0498_0018_0002$$$::Tohsaka's cooperating with me, so I should prioritize this.::
56472::$$$message_0498_0019_0000$$$::"...Hey. Why do you look so reluctant?[lr]::
56473::$$$message_0498_0019_0001$$$::You don't want the procedure? Well, too bad. I'm your surgeon."::
56474::$$$message_0498_0020_0000$$$::"...Yeah, I'll do it. Just checking, but this will only take one day, right? It would be a problem if I can't move tomorrow."::
56475::$$$message_0498_0021_0000$$$::"...To be frank, it could happen. I won't know until we open your Circuits, and it's going to take a while because you're old enough that I shouldn't mess too much with your body. There's also a chance that the surgery itself could fail.[lr]::
56476::$$$message_0498_0021_0001$$$::That's up to fate. How's your luck lately, Emiya?"::
56477::$$$message_0498_0022_0000$$$::...Bad.[lr]::
56478::$$$message_0498_0022_0001$$$::As for what exactly's bad about it, the worst part is that there's someone smiling and asking that question while she has my destiny in a chokehold.::
56479::$$$message_0498_0023_0000$$$::"...Hold on. That would be really bad.[lr]::
56480::$$$message_0498_0023_0001$$$::I need to go home tomorrow."[lr]::
56481::$$$message_0498_0023_0002$$$::"Home? You mean your house?"::
56482::$$$message_0498_0024_0000$$$::"Yeah. Sakura has a cold, so I need to look after her. If I'm going to be staying over here a few nights, then I can't rest easy unless I check in on her beforehand."::
56483::$$$message_0498_0025_0000$$$::"Oh, crap. I forgot."[lr]::
56484::$$$message_0498_0025_0001$$$::...She's fed up with me.[lr]::
56485::$$$message_0498_0025_0002$$$::Tohsaka looks at me in surprise, then exclaims,[lr]::
56486::$$$message_0498_0025_0003$$$::"You idiot! If you'd said that sooner, I wouldn't have kept you here so long!"[lr]::
56487::$$$message_0498_0025_0004$$$::It's my turn to be surprised.::
56488::$$$message_0498_0026_0000$$$::"We can talk about switches later! We can do the rest at your house!"[lr]::
56489::$$$message_0498_0026_0001$$$::"Huh? Huh!?"[lr]::
56490::$$$message_0498_0026_0002$$$::She storms across the room to the coat rack and dons her coat.::
56491::$$$message_0498_0027_0000$$$::"Let's go. I've done what we came to do, and we can finish the rest at your house. We'll pick this up once you take care of Sakura, so hurry up and get home."[lr]::
56492::$$$message_0498_0027_0001$$$::"Uh...y-yeah. I appreciate that."::
56493::$$$message_0498_0028_0000$$$::"Hmph! Also, I might forget to say it later, so I'll tell you this now.[lr]::
56494::$$$message_0498_0028_0001$$$::   Your real specialty isn't Strengthening, but Projection.[lr]::
56495::$$$message_0498_0028_0002$$$::I don't know when or how you mixed that up, but you're supposed to be a mage who creates things."[lr]::
56496::$$$message_0498_0028_0003$$$::Tohsaka walks briskly down the hallway.::
56497::$$$message_0498_0029_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
56498::$$$message_0498_0029_0001$$$::I'm a little confused, but I follow her, and we depart the historic Tohsaka mansion.:ию/
