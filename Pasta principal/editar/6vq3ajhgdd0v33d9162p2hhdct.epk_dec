24184::$$$message_0211_0000_0000$$$::   Shinji comes first.[lr]::
24185::$$$message_0211_0000_0001$$$::If Saber defeated Rider, my job is to catch Shinji and make him quit being a Master!::
24186::$$$message_0211_0001_0000$$$::"Hah...ha...haaah!"[lr]::
24187::$$$message_0211_0001_0001$$$::The sharp sound of footsteps echoed in the darkness.[lr]::
24188::$$$message_0211_0001_0002$$$::Shinji is fleeing down the dark staircase.::
24189::$$$message_0211_0002_0000$$$::"Damn...! What the hell is with that woman!? How can something so freaking crazy happen!? Rider's Noble Phantasm is supposed to be the strongest, so how the hell did she lose!? Why does a stupid Saber have a Noble Phantasm like that!? It's not fair. It's not fair! IT'S NOT FAIR!!!"::
24190::$$$message_0211_0003_0000$$$::He rolls down the stairs, crashes into a wall, and then scampers on the ground.::
24191::$$$message_0211_0003_0001$$$::Shinji is heading down, down, down.[lr]::
24192::$$$message_0211_0003_0002$$$::The image of the light severing Rider is ingrained into his mind, never leaving.[lr]::
24193::$$$message_0211_0003_0003$$$::It's like he says. That Noble Phantasm was unbelievable.[lr]::
24194::$$$message_0211_0003_0004$$$::That sacred sword may look godly to allies, but to an opponent it must be truly, horribly demonic.::
24195::$$$message_0211_0004_0000$$$::"Fu...fuah...aaah!!!"[lr]::
24196::$$$message_0211_0004_0001$$$::So Shinji runs, even in pitch darkness.[lr]::
24197::$$$message_0211_0004_0002$$$::That light will find him if he stops.[lr]::
24198::$$$message_0211_0004_0003$$$::And if he turns around, it'll burn him to nothing, just like Rider.[lr]::
24199::$$$message_0211_0004_0004$$$::He can't afford to stop.[lr]::
24200::$$$message_0211_0004_0005$$$::More than the loss of his Servant, more than the loss of his Command Spells and the end to his time as a Master...Shinji fears for his life.::
24201::$$$message_0211_0005_0000$$$::"Hah...! Damn...damndamndamndamn!!![lr]::
24202::$$$message_0211_0005_0001$$$::What was that crap about her Noble Phantasm being invincible!? That woman was all talk! How dare she trick me! She got into this mess because she was just too arrogant... That idiot!" [lr]::
24203::$$$message_0211_0005_0002$$$::But she followed his orders, just as he gave them to her.[lr]::
24204::$$$message_0211_0005_0003$$$::He told her not to make it quick.[lr]::
24205::$$$message_0211_0005_0004$$$::Rider had suggested destroying their enemies with a single blow from her Noble Phantasm, but Shinji ignored her and instead backed Saber into a corner.::
24206::$$$message_0211_0006_0000$$$::"Haaa...ah...gahhh!!!"[lr]::
24207::$$$message_0211_0006_0001$$$::He's fallen again.[lr]::
24208::$$$message_0211_0006_0002$$$::He should be near to escaping the darkness, but he's run into a wall of some kind.[lr]::
24209::$$$message_0211_0006_0003$$$::"What!? Who the hell put a wall here!?"[lr]::
24210::$$$message_0211_0006_0004$$$::He punches it to vent his anger.::
24211::$$$message_0211_0007_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
24212::$$$message_0211_0007_0001$$$::Something sounds off.[lr]::
24213::$$$message_0211_0007_0002$$$::Shinji looks again at what he thought was a wall, then looks at his own arm, which is bent backward in a near circle...[lr]::
24214::$$$message_0211_0007_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
24215::$$$message_0211_0007_0004$$$::He's too afraid even to scream.::
24216::$$$message_0211_0008_0000$$$::"You're not playing fair, you little Makiri maggot. There's no escape for losers like you."::
24217::$$$message_0211_0009_0000$$$::Playful laughter fills the stairwell.[lr]::
24218::$$$message_0211_0009_0001$$$::A silver-haired girl emerges from the oppressive darkness.::
24219::$$$message_0211_0010_0000$$$::"Ma..."[lr]::
24220::$$$message_0211_0010_0001$$$::He recognizes her.[lr]::
24221::$$$message_0211_0010_0002$$$::In the brief instant Shinji realizes who he is seeing, he dies.::
24222::$$$message_0211_0011_0000$$$::I run through the darkened stairwell.[lr]::
24223::$$$message_0211_0011_0001$$$::It may be too dark to see, but I can still pursue Shinji.[lr]::
24224::$$$message_0211_0011_0002$$$::There's nothing else around to make noise at this point.[lr]::
24225::$$$message_0211_0011_0003$$$::The sound of Shinji's footsteps echoes up the stairwell, so he's not hard to follow.::
24226::$$$message_0211_0012_0000$$$::"Huh? I don't hear his footsteps anymore..."[lr]::
24227::$$$message_0211_0012_0001$$$::The change happens suddenly.[lr]::
24228::$$$message_0211_0012_0002$$$::He was close. I could hear it, and he's still got a ways to go before he reaches the elevators.[lr]::
24229::$$$message_0211_0012_0003$$$::I can't think of any reason for Shinji to stop here.::
24230::$$$message_0211_0013_0000$$$::"...Shinji?"[lr]::
24231::$$$message_0211_0013_0001$$$::I move quietly, cautiously...[lr]::
24232::$$$message_0211_0013_0002$$$::...and immediately find the reason his footsteps stopped.[lr]::
24233::$$$message_0211_0013_0003$$$::I see where Shinji stopped running.[lr]::
24234::$$$message_0211_0013_0004$$$::The corridor, which had been empty when I passed by on my way up, is now splattered with blood.::
24235::$$$message_0211_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
24236::$$$message_0211_0014_0001$$$::I feel my senses buzz with numbness.[lr]::
24237::$$$message_0211_0014_0002$$$::Before my mind even attempts to understand what's happened here, my body reacts instinctively.[lr]::
24238::$$$message_0211_0014_0003$$$::   I shouldn't be here.[lr]::
24239::$$$message_0211_0014_0004$$$::Saber told me to listen to my senses, and they are screaming at me to head back to the roof if I want to live.::
24240::$$$message_0211_0015_0000$$$::"Sorry I'm late. Are you all right, Saber?"[lr]::
24241::$$$message_0211_0015_0001$$$::I fight down my nausea and make my way to Saber.::
24242::$$$message_0211_0016_0000$$$::"Eh...?"[lr]::
24243::$$$message_0211_0016_0001$$$::Saber is in bad shape.[lr]::
24244::$$$message_0211_0016_0002$$$::Beads of sweat trickle down her brow, and her breath is shallow, labored. She looks like she's got a fever.::
24245::$$$message_0211_0017_0000$$$::"No way... Hey, Saber! What's going on!?"[lr]::
24246::$$$message_0211_0017_0001$$$::I call out to Saber nervously, but she doesn't respond.[lr]::
24247::$$$message_0211_0017_0002$$$::...She's out cold.::
24248::$$$message_0211_0018_0000$$$::"Sa...ber...?"[lr]::
24249::$$$message_0211_0018_0001$$$::I touch her forehead.[lr]::
24250::$$$message_0211_0018_0002$$$::"It's hot!"[lr]::
24251::$$$message_0211_0018_0003$$$::I jerk my hand away.[lr]::
24252::$$$message_0211_0018_0004$$$::I-it's unnaturally hot![lr]::
24253::$$$message_0211_0018_0005$$$::She's got to be running a fever of over forty degrees!::
24254::$$$message_0211_0019_0000$$$::"Saber! Hey, pull yourself together!"[lr]::
24255::$$$message_0211_0019_0001$$$::I call out to her, but her only response is shallow, anguished breathing.[lr]::
24256::$$$message_0211_0019_0002$$$::"...Ngh!"[lr]::
24257::$$$message_0211_0019_0003$$$::I don't know what the hell's going on.[lr]::
24258::$$$message_0211_0019_0004$$$::I don't know what to do, but I can't just stand around.::
24259::$$$message_0211_0020_0000$$$::"I'm going to take you home! I'll deal with any complaints later!"[lr]::
24260::$$$message_0211_0020_0001$$$::I lift Saber up.[lr]::
24261::$$$message_0211_0020_0002$$$::She's so light.[lr]::
24262::$$$message_0211_0020_0003$$$::I knew that, of course...but now she seems even lighter.[lr]::
24263::$$$message_0211_0020_0004$$$::No, more than that, she's...::
24264::$$$message_0211_0021_0000$$$::"She's warm. That means she's still alive."[lr]::
24265::$$$message_0211_0021_0001$$$::Saber is still the person I've known all this time.[lr]::
24266::$$$message_0211_0021_0002$$$::I'm pissed with myself for even hesitating.[lr]::
24267::$$$message_0211_0021_0003$$$::Damn! What's it matter if she's a hero?[lr]::
24268::$$$message_0211_0021_0004$$$::No matter who Saber is, she's here, and she's still warm.[lr]::
24269::$$$message_0211_0021_0005$$$::How much of an idiot was I for putting up this wall between us before!?::
24270::$$$message_0211_0022_0000$$$::"We're going home quick. Just hold still, Saber!"[lr]::
24271::$$$message_0211_0022_0001$$$::I start running, Saber in my arms.[lr]::
24272::$$$message_0211_0022_0002$$$::There's no sense of triumph from this victory.[lr]::
24273::$$$message_0211_0022_0003$$$::All I feel is Saber in my arms, barely breathing.::
