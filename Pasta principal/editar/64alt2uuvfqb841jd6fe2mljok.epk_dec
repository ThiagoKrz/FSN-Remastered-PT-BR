37617::$$$message_0324_0000_0000$$$::After dinner.[lr]::
37618::$$$message_0324_0000_0001$$$::I finished cleaning up and face Saber in the dojo.[lr]::
37619::$$$message_0324_0000_0002$$$::I tell her what happened today and how we eliminated the Bounded Field at school. And how Tohsaka anticipates that there'll be a counterattack tomorrow.::
37620::$$$message_0324_0001_0000$$$::...I don't tell her about Shinji.[lr]::
37621::$$$message_0324_0001_0001$$$::I don't want her to consider him an enemy until his true intentions are clear.::
37622::$$$message_0324_0002_0000$$$::"Then, we will not be going out tonight, Shirou?"[lr]::
37623::$$$message_0324_0002_0001$$$::"...Yeah. I'm sure it's frustrating for you, but sit tight for tonight. I don't intend to fight needless battles, and more than anything, we're not in a place to be able to fight freely."::
37624::$$$message_0324_0003_0000$$$::I'm inexperienced as a Master, and Saber has a limit to how many times she can battle since I'm not able to provide her with any magical energy.[lr]::
37625::$$$message_0324_0003_0001$$$::Given our situation, it's not a good idea to be aimlessly looking around for Masters.::
37626::$$$message_0324_0004_0000$$$::"...Understood. You certainly do have a point. It is not proactive, but we do need to exercise utmost caution in order to win."[lr]::
37627::$$$message_0324_0004_0001$$$::"...However. If you have the will to fight, we must not waste any time. If we are to stay here tonight, then we should use this time to train."::
37628::$$$message_0324_0005_0000$$$::Saber stares at me.[lr]::
37629::$$$message_0324_0005_0001$$$::She doesn't even need to tell me.[lr]::
37630::$$$message_0324_0005_0002$$$::I brought Saber to this dojo with that in mind.::
37631::$$$message_0324_0006_0000$$$::"I know. Do you remember what happened last night?[lr]::
37632::$$$message_0324_0006_0001$$$::We had a match since you told me that I was slacking off for coming home late.::
37633::$$$message_0324_0007_0000$$$::"Khh...! That is because Taiga told me that I had to go hard on you or else you would not listen to me. I-it is not because I was angry yesterday[line2]"::
37634::$$$message_0324_0008_0000$$$::"No, it's fine. That was a good lesson.[lr]::
37635::$$$message_0324_0008_0001$$$::No matter what I do, there's going to be those I can't beat.[lr]::
37636::$$$message_0324_0008_0002$$$::That was never more apparent than when I fought you."::
37637::$$$message_0324_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
37638::$$$message_0324_0009_0001$$$::"With that in mind, I think it's important to train with you. I don't know how effective it'll be, but I should be able to survive a bit longer in battle if you're hard on me."::
37639::$$$message_0324_0010_0000$$$::"Then, Shirou..."[lr]::
37640::$$$message_0324_0010_0001$$$::"Yeah. Please train me whenever we have the time.[lr]::
37641::$$$message_0324_0010_0002$$$::For today, that'll be until we go to bed."::
37642::$$$message_0324_0011_0000$$$::I take the bamboo sword on the wall.[lr]::
37643::$$$message_0324_0011_0001$$$::...It's still 8 PM.[lr]::
37644::$$$message_0324_0011_0002$$$::There's still four hours until bedtime, so I'll train my heart out.:“×¯
