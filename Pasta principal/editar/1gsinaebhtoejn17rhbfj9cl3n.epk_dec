36458::$$$message_0306_0000_0000$$$::It's past 7 AM.[lr]::
36459::$$$message_0306_0000_0001$$$::It's later than usual, but I should make it on time without having to hurry.::
36460::$$$message_0306_0001_0000$$$::It's 7:40 AM.[lr]::
36461::$$$message_0306_0001_0001$$$::I go through the gate with plenty of time and as I make my way to the building...[lr]::
36462::$$$message_0306_0001_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36463::$$$message_0306_0001_0003$$$::I'm overcome with a strange feeling and stop in place.::
36464::$$$message_0306_0002_0000$$$::"...What is that? I guess there's nothing wrong..."::
36465::$$$message_0306_0003_0000$$$::It's not like someone is watching me nor is the view any different.[lr]::
36466::$$$message_0306_0003_0001$$$::If anything... It would be that it's muted.[lr]::
36467::$$$message_0306_0003_0002$$$::Like there's some sort of illusion going on. Everything...the students, the trees, even the school buildings all feel like they've lost their color.::
36468::$$$message_0306_0004_0000$$$::"...Maybe it's my imagination. I might be hypersensitive from everything going on."[lr]::
36469::$$$message_0306_0004_0001$$$::I close my eyes and rotate my shoulders.[lr]::
36470::$$$message_0306_0004_0002$$$::...But...[lr]::
36471::$$$message_0306_0004_0003$$$::Even after taking a deep breath, that unknown strange feeling doesn't disappear.::
36472::$$$message_0306_0005_0000$$$::I go up to the third floor and head to my classroom.[lr]::
36473::$$$message_0306_0005_0001$$$::Then...[lr]::
36474::$$$message_0306_0005_0002$$$::I run into Tohsaka.::
36475::$$$message_0306_0006_0000$$$::"Yo."[lr]::
36476::$$$message_0306_0006_0001$$$::Since we do know each other now, I casually greet her.[lr]::
36477::$$$message_0306_0006_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
36478::$$$message_0306_0006_0003$$$::But, Tohsaka is frozen as if she saw a ghost.::
36479::$$$message_0306_0007_0000$$$::"Tohsaka? What, is there something on my face?"[lr]::
36480::$$$message_0306_0007_0001$$$::I wipe my cheek with the sleeve of my uniform.[lr]::
36481::$$$message_0306_0007_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
36482::$$$message_0306_0007_0003$$$::Tohsaka still doesn't reply.[lr]::
36483::$$$message_0306_0007_0004$$$::She looks away and goes back to her classroom.::
36484::$$$message_0306_0008_0000$$$::I'm confused.[lr]::
36485::$$$message_0306_0008_0001$$$::What was with that reaction?[lr]::
36486::$$$message_0306_0008_0002$$$::I don't think it's like her to ignore someone who greeted her.::
36487::$$$message_0306_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36488::$$$message_0306_0009_0001$$$::The strange feeling hits me again once I enter the classroom.[lr]::
36489::$$$message_0306_0009_0002$$$::Someone might've brought in some snacks here, since I smell something slightly sweet. ::
36490::$$$message_0306_0010_0000$$$::"...I guess the classroom is the same as usual."[lr]::
36491::$$$message_0306_0010_0001$$$::I greet the other boys and sit at my seat.[lr]::
36492::$$$message_0306_0010_0002$$$::There's ten more minutes until homeroom starts.[lr]::
36493::$$$message_0306_0010_0003$$$::I look around the classroom and notice a seat without a bag.::
36494::$$$message_0306_0011_0000$$$::"Shinji's absent, huh?"[lr]::
36495::$$$message_0306_0011_0001$$$::Come to think of it, he missed yesterday's practice too.[lr]::
36496::$$$message_0306_0011_0002$$$::Despite how he looks, Shinji is punctual and tries hard to follow the rules. [lr]::
36497::$$$message_0306_0011_0003$$$::It bothers me a bit that a guy like that has been absent for two days.::
36498::$$$message_0306_0012_0000$$$::The day ends without incident.[lr]::
36499::$$$message_0306_0012_0001$$$::Classes are over, and there are only a few students left in the classroom.::
36500::$$$message_0306_0013_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36501::$$$message_0306_0013_0001$$$::There's nothing in particular for me to do.[lr]::
36502::$$$message_0306_0013_0002$$$::I have to get home before dark as I promised Saber, but...::
36503::$$$message_0306_0014_0000$$$::"...It's not just my imagination. Something has been off since this morning."[lr]::
36504::$$$message_0306_0014_0001$$$::Focusing, I take a good look around at my surroundings.[lr]::
36505::$$$message_0306_0014_0002$$$::...The strange feeling sticks onto my back.[lr]::
36506::$$$message_0306_0014_0003$$$::Perhaps it's because my Magic Circuit can be more easily opened now that I am a Master, but the circuit in my spine senses a subtle chill.::
36507::$$$message_0306_0015_0000$$$::"...I still have time. I'll look around the school for a bit and go home if nothing's wrong..."[lr]::
36508::$$$message_0306_0015_0001$$$::I'm a little uneasy at going about this without Saber, but I don't have an easy way to bring her here.[lr]::
36509::$$$message_0306_0015_0002$$$::It shouldn't be too dangerous for me to casually look around.::
36510::$$$message_0306_0016_0000$$$::The sun sets.[lr]::
36511::$$$message_0306_0016_0001$$$::I looked around school trying not to look suspicious, but I didn't find anything that seemed unusual.::
36512::$$$message_0306_0017_0000$$$::"...I guess it's no use by myself. I'll come and search again with Saber at night."[lr]::
36513::$$$message_0306_0017_0001$$$::I grab my bag and leave the classroom.::
36514::$$$message_0306_0018_0000$$$::The sky is tinted crimson.[lr]::
36515::$$$message_0306_0018_0001$$$::The sun is setting and it should get dark in an hour or so.::
36516::$$$message_0306_0019_0000$$$::I get to the stairs on the third floor.[lr]::
36517::$$$message_0306_0019_0001$$$::As I sling my bag and start to make my way back home, I hear a sound above my head.::
36518::$$$message_0306_0020_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
36519::$$$message_0306_0020_0001$$$::I look up.[lr]::
36520::$$$message_0306_0020_0002$$$::There...[lr]::
36521::$$$message_0306_0020_0003$$$::Tohsaka is standing firmly at the top of the stairs leading to the fourth floor.::
36522::$$$message_0306_0021_0000$$$::"Oh, you're still here, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
36523::$$$message_0306_0021_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
36524::$$$message_0306_0021_0002$$$::She doesn't answer.[lr]::
36525::$$$message_0306_0021_0003$$$::First this morning and now this... I feel like her stink eye gets worse every time I see her.::
36526::$$$message_0306_0022_0000$$$::"Hm? What? If you have nothing to say, then I'm going."[lr]::
36527::$$$message_0306_0022_0001$$$::I raise my bag to show her I'm going home now.::
36528::$$$message_0306_0023_0000$$$::"...Khh."[lr]::
36529::$$$message_0306_0023_0001$$$::[font italic=true]What now?[font italic=false][lr]::
36530::$$$message_0306_0023_0002$$$::The sigh Tohsaka gives is telling me she's had it up to here.::
36531::$$$message_0306_0024_0000$$$::"I'm stunned. Coming to school without your Servant... Are you insane?"[lr]::
36532::$$$message_0306_0024_0001$$$::She mutters in a voice without emotion.::
36533::$$$message_0306_0025_0000$$$::"Of course not. Saber can't go into spirit form, so there's no way I can bring her to school."::
36534::$$$message_0306_0026_0000$$$::"Then you should skip school. A Master walking around without their Servant is like asking for others to kill you.[lr]::
36535::$$$message_0306_0026_0001$$$::...Emiya, do you know how stupid you are?"::
36536::$$$message_0306_0027_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]I'm not stupid![lr]::
36537::$$$message_0306_0027_0001$$$::Knock it off. Masters don't fight in places where others can see, right? Then during the day, especially at school, is out of the question."::
36538::$$$message_0306_0028_0000$$$::"...All right. Then, let me ask you. Is this a place where others can see?"[lr]::
36539::$$$message_0306_0028_0001$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
36540::$$$message_0306_0028_0002$$$::What is she saying? I don't need to check to see if others can see[line2]::
36541::$$$message_0306_0029_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
36542::$$$message_0306_0029_0001$$$::How did this...?[lr]::
36543::$$$message_0306_0029_0002$$$::Conveniently, there's no one around.[lr]::
36544::$$$message_0306_0029_0003$$$::There's no one in the third floor hallway. I'm sure it's also the same for the fourth and the second floor.::
36545::$$$message_0306_0030_0000$$$::The school building, bathed in the setting sun, is completely still.[lr]::
36546::$$$message_0306_0030_0001$$$::At this rate, there must only be students or teachers on the first floor...::
36547::$$$message_0306_0031_0000$$$::"It seems like you finally understand.[lr]::
36548::$$$message_0306_0031_0001$$$::...Seriously, this morning, I was more pissed than astonished.[lr]::
36549::$$$message_0306_0031_0002$$$::I told you so many times, but you still came to get killed."[lr]::
36550::$$$message_0306_0031_0003$$$::With a harsh tone of voice, Tohsaka rolls up her left arm's sleeve.::
36551::$$$message_0306_0031_0004$$$::[font italic=true]What is...?[font italic=false][lr]::
36552::$$$message_0306_0031_0005$$$::A pale and slender arm.[lr]::
36553::$$$message_0306_0031_0006$$$::On that feminine arm...[lr]::
36554::$$$message_0306_0031_0007$$$::Something like a glowing tattoo appears.::
36555::$$$message_0306_0032_0000$$$::"...The he[line2]"[lr]::
36556::$$$message_0306_0032_0001$$$::It's not a Command Spell.[lr]::
36557::$$$message_0306_0032_0002$$$::Could that be... I don't have one, but is that a Magic Crest? The proof of a real mage family?::
36558::$$$message_0306_0033_0000$$$::"...I don't need to explain to you, right?[lr]::
36559::$$$message_0306_0033_0001$$$::This is the crystallization of the magecraft passed down by my family. I can activate any magecraft carved on here just by passing magical energy through it."::
36560::$$$message_0306_0033_0002$$$::...Right.[lr]::
36561::$$$message_0306_0033_0003$$$::A Magic Crest is like an attached engine, separate from the Magic Circuit in a mage.[lr]::
36562::$$$message_0306_0033_0004$$$::There is no complicated incantation or procedure to follow.[lr]::
36563::$$$message_0306_0033_0005$$$::It is an ultimate shortcut mechanism that makes the car called magecraft run just by turning it on.::
36564::$$$message_0306_0033_0006$$$::But consequently, the Magic Crest won't show up unless it is in use.[lr]::
36565::$$$message_0306_0033_0007$$$::A Magic Crest is like another Magic Circuit that is formed when the owner passes magical energy through it.::
36566::$$$message_0306_0033_0008$$$::"I had Archer leave. The Gandr Shot in this crest is enough for you."[lr]::
36567::$$$message_0306_0033_0009$$$::Her voice is flat, almost mechanical.[lr]::
36568::$$$message_0306_0033_0010$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36569::$$$message_0306_0033_0011$$$::That makes me realize that she's serious.::
36570::$$$message_0306_0034_0000$$$::"You can run away, but you'll just be making it hard on yourself. I'm going to win anyway."[lr]::
36571::$$$message_0306_0034_0001$$$::She says, coldly.[lr]::
36572::$$$message_0306_0034_0002$$$::But my mind is all over the place.::
36573::$$$message_0306_0035_0000$$$::We're going to seriously fight here...?[lr]::
36574::$$$message_0306_0035_0001$$$::Why here?[lr]::
36575::$$$message_0306_0035_0002$$$::Why now?[lr]::
36576::$$$message_0306_0035_0003$$$::Most importantly of all, why does it have to be against Tohsaka...?::
36577::$$$message_0306_0036_0000$$$::"H-hold on, Tohsaka! Are you out of your mind? We're at school! Who knows who'll come if we cause a commotion[line2]"::
36578::$$$message_0306_0037_0000$$$::"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I have a principle that I won't let the chances in front of me slip by. Sorry, but the coup de grÃ¢ce comes here.[lr]::
36579::$$$message_0306_0037_0001$$$::...And besides, I don't think I can stand having you walk about so carelessly like today."::
36580::$$$message_0306_0038_0000$$$::"I-I said hold on...! I don't have any intention of fighting you[line2]"[lr]::
36581::$$$message_0306_0038_0001$$$::"Well I do...! Just prepare yourself, Shirou...!"::
36582::$$$message_0306_0039_0000$$$::Tohsaka makes a declaration of war and moves her arm.::
36583::$$$message_0306_0040_0000$$$::"Hrrk...!"[lr]::
36584::$$$message_0306_0040_0001$$$::Just what kind of magecraft is that?[lr]::
36585::$$$message_0306_0040_0002$$$::The instant Tohsaka points her left arm towards me, my vision is filled with light.::
36586::$$$message_0306_0041_0000$$$::"Ugh...!"[lr]::
36587::$$$message_0306_0041_0001$$$::It's about four steps if I leap towards the stairs leading to the second floor.[lr]::
36588::$$$message_0306_0041_0002$$$::There's no time to be flustered. I should...::ëœ
