62355::$$$message_0574_0000_0000$$$::I'll go check on Tohsaka and Illya.[lr]::
62356::$$$message_0574_0000_0001$$$::I'm curious about what they're doing, and there might be something I can do to help.::
62357::$$$message_0574_0001_0000$$$::"There's nothing for you to do here. You're in the way, so leave."[lr]::
62358::$$$message_0574_0001_0001$$$::But...[lr]::
62359::$$$message_0574_0001_0002$$$::A second after I knock on the guestroom door, I'm instantly denied entry.::
62360::$$$message_0574_0002_0000$$$::"Mrgh. What's with the attitude? You'll regret it if you always spit on people's goodwill."::
62361::$$$message_0574_0003_0000$$$::"Don't give me that. We're dealing with Tohsaka and Einzbern family secrets right now, so we can't show them to anyone else.[lr]::
62362::$$$message_0574_0003_0001$$$::I'm happy you want to help, but what you're offering is harmful to me and Illya. You wouldn't want to leak your own family's secrets either, would you?"::
62363::$$$message_0574_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62364::$$$message_0574_0004_0001$$$::...I see.[lr]::
62365::$$$message_0574_0004_0002$$$::It makes sense, when she puts it that way.[lr]::
62366::$$$message_0574_0004_0003$$$::Even if we're working together, we each have our secrets.[lr]::
62367::$$$message_0574_0004_0004$$$::Setting that aside...::
62368::$$$message_0574_0005_0000$$$::"Why are you wearing glasses, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
62369::$$$message_0574_0005_0001$$$::"...What, do I look weird?"[lr]::
62370::$$$message_0574_0005_0002$$$::"No, not weird..."[lr]::
62371::$$$message_0574_0005_0003$$$::It's like she's upgraded her image from honors student to student body president.::
62372::$$$message_0574_0006_0000$$$::"...They look great on you."[lr]::
62373::$$$message_0574_0006_0001$$$::"...O-oh. I only wear them when I'm alone, so I can't really tell... You don't think they look weird?"::
62374::$$$message_0574_0007_0000$$$::"Nope. I know who you really are, so you can't fool me with that overachiever image. Is it a disguise?"[lr]::
62375::$$$message_0574_0007_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62376::$$$message_0574_0007_0002$$$::Hm? Is the temperature dropping in the room?::
62377::$$$message_0574_0008_0000$$$::"Tohsaka? I'm getting kinda chilly for some reason."[lr]::
62378::$$$message_0574_0008_0001$$$::Maybe I'm just imagining it. I look to her for confirmation.[lr]::
62379::$$$message_0574_0008_0002$$$::"How about that? My shoulders happen to be shaking too, Emiya.[lr]::
62380::$$$message_0574_0008_0003$$$::I've been thinking it's high time I right some wrongs. If you've got time to go on afternoon strolls, maybe I ought to train you until you can't move anymore."::
62381::$$$message_0574_0009_0000$$$::"Ah...hm."[lr]::
62382::$$$message_0574_0009_0001$$$::...I'm scared. She isn't kidding.[lr]::
62383::$$$message_0574_0009_0002$$$::Looks like she's seriously raking me over the coals for walking around when she told me to save my strength.::
62384::$$$message_0574_0010_0000$$$::"...Sorry, that was thoughtless of me. I'll go rest in my room like you said to."::
62385::$$$message_0574_0011_0000$$$::"...Hmph. Feel free. But if you can move around this much, I think there's something else you should be doing. We're not the ones who need your help right now."[lr]::
62386::$$$message_0574_0011_0001$$$::"Huh? Who needs my help?"::
62387::$$$message_0574_0012_0000$$$::"The girl right next door. She's the one who can't stand it when you aren't around. I wish you'd be more aware of how important you are to Sakura's happiness."::
62388::$$$message_0574_0013_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62389::$$$message_0574_0013_0001$$$::I feel myself flush.[lr]::
62390::$$$message_0574_0013_0002$$$::It's so embarrassing to hear someone say that out loud.::
62391::$$$message_0574_0014_0000$$$::"Um, yeah, roger that. If it's okay to go check on Sakura, then I will."[lr]::
62392::$$$message_0574_0014_0001$$$::I nod robotically.::
62393::$$$message_0574_0015_0000$$$::"Of course it is![lr]::
62394::$$$message_0574_0015_0001$$$::...Ugh, for someone who's usually so careless, you choose some strange times to be cautious."::
62395::$$$message_0574_0016_0000$$$::Tohsaka shuts her bedroom door.[lr]::
62396::$$$message_0574_0016_0001$$$::Sakura's room is the next one over, just a meter or so away.::
62397::$$$message_0574_0017_0000$$$::"Calm down. Calm down. I'm just going to check in on her."[lr]::
62398::$$$message_0574_0017_0001$$$::I take a few deep breaths and stare at the next room's door.[lr]::
62399::$$$message_0574_0017_0002$$$::I-it's not like I have a guilty conscience.[lr]::
62400::$$$message_0574_0017_0003$$$::I'm just going to see whether Sakura's getting her rest.::1_
