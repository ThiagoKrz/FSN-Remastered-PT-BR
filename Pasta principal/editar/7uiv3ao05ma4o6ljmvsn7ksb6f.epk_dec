52954::$$$message_0456_0000_0000$$$::I broke my promise to her, so anything I say is just an excuse.[lr]::
52955::$$$message_0456_0000_0001$$$::I need to do whatever I can to make it up to Illya, but I don't know what would make her happy.[lr]::
52956::$$$message_0456_0000_0002$$$::Then...why don't you act like a Master and use your Command Spells to make your wish come true?::
52957::$$$message_0456_0001_0000$$$::"Why are you all quiet? That face won't fool me. If you're not going to apologize, then I won't either. If you don't like me, then I'll[line2]"::
52958::$$$message_0456_0002_0000$$$::"All right. Illya, I'm your Servant. To make it up to you for breaking our promise, why don't I be your Servant just this once?"[lr]::
52959::$$$message_0456_0002_0001$$$::"...turn you into a puppet[line2]wait, my Servant!?"::
52960::$$$message_0456_0003_0000$$$::"That's right. It's too late to hang out today. So, I'll do whatever you ask, just once. That should make you feel a little better, right?"::
52961::$$$message_0456_0004_0000$$$::".........[lr]::
52962::$$$message_0456_0004_0001$$$::No, you're lying! You didn't come to the park. Anyone can break a verbal promise, so I don't believe you!"::
52963::$$$message_0456_0005_0000$$$::"I know. So I'll treat it like a Command Spell to prove it to you. I'll make a promise I can't break, just this once. Will you trust me then?"::
52964::$$$message_0456_0006_0000$$$::"T-trust you... But I don't have any Command Spells that work on you..."::
52965::$$$message_0456_0007_0000$$$::"Yeah. But I swear I'll keep my word. It isn't a real contract and the Command Spell will not actually be used, but I'll act like you cast one on me.[lr]::
52966::$$$message_0456_0007_0001$$$::You and I are both Masters. I can swear on my own crest that I won't break a promise we treat as a Command Spell."::
52967::$$$message_0456_0008_0000$$$::I stand up straight and swear an oath to Illya.[lr]::
52968::$$$message_0456_0008_0001$$$::The silver-haired girl takes a quiet breath.[lr]::
52969::$$$message_0456_0008_0002$$$::"...You'll really do anything I say?"[lr]::
52970::$$$message_0456_0008_0003$$$::She looks at me uneasily.::
52971::$$$message_0456_0009_0000$$$::"Of course. It's a Command Spell, you know. I'll do whatever's within my power to obey."[lr]::
52972::$$$message_0456_0009_0001$$$::I return her anxious gaze with a heartfelt smile.::
52973::$$$message_0456_0010_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
52974::$$$message_0456_0010_0001$$$::A long silence passes between us.[lr]::
52975::$$$message_0456_0010_0002$$$::Illya looks away and clutches her hands together.::
52976::$$$message_0456_0011_0000$$$::"...All right. Then...take me..."[lr]::
52977::$$$message_0456_0011_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
52978::$$$message_0456_0011_0002$$$::Did I hear her correctly?[lr]::
52979::$$$message_0456_0011_0003$$$::I was expecting an order worthy of a Command Spell, but it's a much smaller wish than that.::
52980::$$$message_0456_0012_0000$$$::"Illya...? Wait, I said a Command Spell. I'll do absolutely anything you say. Are you sure that's what you want?"::
52981::$$$message_0456_0013_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
52982::$$$message_0456_0013_0001$$$::"You could ask for something else. That's way too easy. C'mon, don't hold back on my account. Ask me to[line2]"[lr]::
52983::$$$message_0456_0013_0002$$$::"I'm not holding back! You lied! You said you would do anything!"::
52984::$$$message_0456_0014_0000$$$::"Uh, yeah, I will! But are you sure, Illya? I mean, that's too..."[lr]::
52985::$$$message_0456_0014_0001$$$::Something I'd do for you anytime you asked, no Command Spell needed.::
52986::$$$message_0456_0015_0000$$$::"...No, it isn't. It's something I've always wanted. And it's what I want most from you right now."[lr]::
52987::$$$message_0456_0015_0001$$$::Blushing furiously, Illya trembles as if anticipating rejection.::
52988::$$$message_0456_0016_0000$$$::"...Illya."[lr]::
52989::$$$message_0456_0016_0001$$$::I shouldn't keep doubting her courage.[lr]::
52990::$$$message_0456_0016_0002$$$::It's her number one wish, even if it sounds simple.[lr]::
52991::$$$message_0456_0016_0003$$$::Right now, I just need to serve Illya the best I can, as her knight.::
52992::$$$message_0456_0017_0000$$$::"All right. Sorry for the stupid question.[lr]::
52993::$$$message_0456_0017_0001$$$::Let's go, Illya. The shopping district isn't big, but it'll be fun to walk around."::
52994::$$$message_0456_0018_0000$$$::I feel my face get hot at the way I phrased it.[lr]::
52995::$$$message_0456_0018_0001$$$::I know I'm blushing red.[lr]::
52996::$$$message_0456_0018_0002$$$::Without hiding it, I give Illya my hand.::
52997::$$$message_0456_0019_0000$$$::Her wish is a trivial one: [lr]::
52998::$$$message_0456_0019_0001$$$::"Take me shopping."[r][wsay canskip=1]::
52999::$$$message_0456_0019_0002$$$::Nothing special at all.[lr]::
53000::$$$message_0456_0019_0003$$$::Illya wants to do something completely normal, that I could help her with as many times as she wants.::
53001::$$$message_0456_0020_0000$$$::...I can't imagine what it must mean to her.[lr]::
53002::$$$message_0456_0020_0001$$$::I just do as she asks and walk around the shopping district with her. Not as enemies or allies, not as Masters, but as brother and sister.[lr]::
53003::$$$message_0456_0020_0002$$$::She stares with wonder at shops I know well and sights I'm sick of seeing.::
53004::$$$message_0456_0021_0000$$$::Her excitement is so infectious that I have fun just watching her.[lr]::
53005::$$$message_0456_0021_0001$$$::She walks through the street with a sunny, carefree smile.[lr]::
53006::$$$message_0456_0021_0002$$$::I wish I could make this moment last forever for her.::
53007::$$$message_0456_0022_0000$$$::   But sadly, I start to understand.[lr]::
53008::$$$message_0456_0022_0001$$$::Her smile doesn't crack for a second. She dances through the street.[lr]::
53009::$$$message_0456_0022_0002$$$::This isn't happiness.[lr]::
53010::$$$message_0456_0022_0003$$$::She's smiling desperately, because she's sad. Because she doesn't want to wake up from this dream.::
53011::$$$message_0456_0023_0000$$$::"Over here, Shirou! Your coffee's going to get cold!"[lr]::
53012::$$$message_0456_0023_0001$$$::Illya runs toward the park with the two drinks she bought. Maybe she hasn't seen hot canned beverages before.::
53013::$$$message_0456_0024_0000$$$::I wish this day could go on. I want to tell her she doesn't have to keep doing this. But, everything must come to an end.[lr]::
53014::$$$message_0456_0024_0001$$$::Miyama's shopping district is small.[lr]::
53015::$$$message_0456_0024_0002$$$::No matter how slowly we go, we can see it all in an hour.::
53016::$$$message_0456_0025_0000$$$::"And here we are! This is our last stop, Shirou.[lr]::
53017::$$$message_0456_0025_0001$$$::You can rest now. Thanks for working so hard today."::
53018::$$$message_0456_0026_0000$$$::In front of the bench, Illya twirls to face me.[lr]::
53019::$$$message_0456_0026_0001$$$::She beckons me to sit and rest, so I do.::
53020::$$$message_0456_0027_0000$$$::And yet...[lr]::
53021::$$$message_0456_0027_0001$$$::Illya doesn't sit, even though she invited me to.::
53022::$$$message_0456_0028_0000$$$::"Illya? Aren't you going to sit down?"[lr]::
53023::$$$message_0456_0028_0001$$$::"Mm-hm. Here's your drink, Shirou. Yours is coffee, and mine is shiruko."::
53024::$$$message_0456_0029_0000$$$::Illya takes only one can out of her pocket and hands it to me.[lr]::
53025::$$$message_0456_0029_0001$$$::She keeps the other can in her coat pocket. It's the only thing she badgered me into buying today.::
53026::$$$message_0456_0030_0000$$$::"I'm surprised you know what shiruko is, Illya. I bet they don't have red bean drinks overseas."[lr]::
53027::$$$message_0456_0030_0001$$$::"Yeah. It's my first time seeing it. A long time ago, someone told me it's really sweet, so I shouldn't drink it."::
53028::$$$message_0456_0031_0000$$$::Illya grins at me and does a little step and twirl.[lr]::
53029::$$$message_0456_0031_0001$$$::She makes her way to the center of the park, practically dancing as she goes.::
53030::$$$message_0456_0032_0000$$$::"Illya...?"[lr]::
53031::$$$message_0456_0032_0001$$$::"The Command Spell is over now. It wasn't a long time, but thanks, Shirou."[lr]::
53032::$$$message_0456_0032_0002$$$::There isn't a hint of gloom in her voice.[lr]::
53033::$$$message_0456_0032_0003$$$::She gives me a smile free of any regrets, declaring an abrupt end to the dream.::
53034::$$$message_0456_0033_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]what are you thanking me for? It hasn't even been an hour. If you're tired of this place, we can go see the city. There's a lot more[line2]"::
53035::$$$message_0456_0034_0000$$$::"It's okay. This is our last stop. It's been fun, but shopping is over. Once the sun sets soon, we'll be back to our old relationship.[lr]::
53036::$$$message_0456_0034_0001$$$::We'll both be Masters; I'll try to kill you, while you defend yourself. I've understood that since before we met."::
53037::$$$message_0456_0035_0000$$$::What am I supposed to say to that determined smile?[lr]::
53038::$$$message_0456_0035_0001$$$::Illya wants a normal life more than I ever would, and yet she casts it aside more easily than I ever could.::
53039::$$$message_0456_0036_0000$$$::"I see. So once we leave this park..."[lr]::
53040::$$$message_0456_0036_0001$$$::"We'll be enemies again. The next time we meet at night, we'll continue what we started last time.[lr]::
53041::$$$message_0456_0036_0002$$$::So if you don't want me to kill you, then you'll have to kill me first, Shirou."::
53042::$$$message_0456_0037_0000$$$::My breath catches in my throat, and I look up at the sky.[lr]::
53043::$$$message_0456_0037_0001$$$::   The sky is an overcast gray.[lr]::
53044::$$$message_0456_0037_0002$$$::Heavy clouds cover the town, bringing an end to the happy times.[lr]::
53045::$$$message_0456_0037_0003$$$::I wish they could last forever, but I knew this moment would come once I realized that would only be harder on Illya.::
53046::$$$message_0456_0038_0000$$$::She said that this is our last stop.[lr]::
53047::$$$message_0456_0038_0001$$$::The end of the line.[lr]::
53048::$$$message_0456_0038_0002$$$::Here, where there's nowhere else to go and no way back, Illya keeps smiling innocently.::
53049::$$$message_0456_0039_0000$$$::"Wow! Look Shirou, snow!"[lr]::
53050::$$$message_0456_0039_0001$$$::Her cheerful voice captures my attention.[lr]::
53051::$$$message_0456_0039_0002$$$::When I look back at the park, I'm greeted by a distant scene.::
53052::$$$message_0456_0040_0000$$$::For a second, I think I'm seeing things.[lr]::
53053::$$$message_0456_0040_0001$$$::It's not the falling snow that surprises me, but the unreal sight of Illya dancing.::
53054::$$$message_0456_0041_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
53055::$$$message_0456_0041_0001$$$::The snow is only temporary.[lr]::
53056::$$$message_0456_0041_0002$$$::I can tell it's just a bit of powder snow that will stop soon.::
53057::$$$message_0456_0042_0000$$$::But under it, in this uncertain winter, the area around Illya is so white.[lr]::
53058::$$$message_0456_0042_0001$$$::The silver-haired girl frolics in the fleeting frost, as if loved by winter itself.::
53059::$$$message_0456_0043_0000$$$::"Aha! The snow here is so warm. This is my first time seeing such normal snowfall."[lr]::
53060::$$$message_0456_0043_0001$$$::Illya twirls and twirls, overjoyed.::
53061::$$$message_0456_0044_0000$$$::"You're awfully upbeat. Do you like snow, Illya?"[lr]::
53062::$$$message_0456_0044_0001$$$::"Yeah. I don't like the cold, but I like snow itself. It's gentle and reminds me of my mother. Also, she told me my white hair was pretty."::
53063::$$$message_0456_0045_0000$$$::Her smile is so merry.[lr]::
53064::$$$message_0456_0045_0001$$$::Intuitively, I know who said that to her.::
53065::$$$message_0456_0046_0000$$$::"The snow here is so pretty. So it snows properly in the land where Kiritsugu lived, huh?"::
53066::$$$message_0456_0047_0000$$$::That carefree smile isn't for me.[lr]::
53067::$$$message_0456_0047_0001$$$::...Illyasviel von Einzbern.[lr]::
53068::$$$message_0456_0047_0002$$$::The pale girl who came here to kill my father.[lr]::
53069::$$$message_0456_0047_0003$$$::She came here looking for Kiritsugu, and she's trying to kill me.[lr]::
53070::$$$message_0456_0047_0004$$$::...I've long since realized the true reason why.::
53071::$$$message_0456_0048_0000$$$::He betrayed the Einzberns.[lr]::
53072::$$$message_0456_0048_0001$$$::Then, he threw away his entire life to come live here.[lr]::
53073::$$$message_0456_0048_0002$$$::From the perspective of Kiritsugu's son, she's a child who's been chasing after a man who has nothing to do with her.[lr]::
53074::$$$message_0456_0048_0003$$$::   Until I became a Master, I had no idea what he gave up.::
53075::$$$message_0456_0049_0000$$$::The snow seems to hide Illya as she dances.[lr]::
53076::$$$message_0456_0049_0001$$$::The girl from a faraway country bids me farewell with a smile.::
53077::$$$message_0456_0050_0000$$$::"Bye, Shirou. If I see you walking around alone again, I'll play with you!"::
53078::$$$message_0456_0051_0000$$$::Smiling innocently, the pale girl disappears from the park.::
53079::$$$message_0456_0052_0000$$$::The symbol of winter leaves, and the snow fades as if its life is cut short.[lr]::
53080::$$$message_0456_0052_0001$$$::It was a momentary illusion.[lr]::
53081::$$$message_0456_0052_0002$$$::I brush aside the crystals that failed to even pile up, and leave our final stop.::
