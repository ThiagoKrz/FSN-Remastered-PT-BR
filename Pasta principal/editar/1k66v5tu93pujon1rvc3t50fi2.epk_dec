2043::$$$message_0017_0000_0000$$$::"I should probably clean the floors."[lr]::
2044::$$$message_0017_0000_0001$$$::I told Saber to meet me here a little later.[lr]::
2045::$$$message_0017_0000_0002$$$::I always just do the bare minimum of cleaning in here. It's been years since I sparred with anyone in this place.[lr]::
2046::$$$message_0017_0000_0003$$$::It'd probably be rude to both the dojo and Saber if I don't clean up a little.::
2047::$$$message_0017_0001_0000$$$::"But honestly, I don't know what she's going to do for sword training."::
2048::$$$message_0017_0002_0000$$$::I've sparred using a shinai with Kiritsugu many times, but Kiritsugu and I never really cared about proper form. It was more like a couple of amateurs beating each other up.[lr]::
2049::$$$message_0017_0002_0001$$$::I never really had any plans to practice kendo seriously, and I was really only taught how to fight opponents wielding a sword.::
2050::$$$message_0017_0003_0000$$$::"I was never keen on using tools in a fight. My interest was always making and fixing them."::
2051::$$$message_0017_0004_0000$$$::In that sense, this might be the first time for me to learn proper swordsmanship in any serious sense.[lr]::
2052::$$$message_0017_0004_0001$$$::Saber's swordsmanship is different than kendo, but I'm sure there are some things in common, and I don't think they're so different I won't be able to keep up.::
2053::$$$message_0017_0005_0000$$$::I hear the door open.[lr]::
2054::$$$message_0017_0005_0001$$$::Saber arrives precisely on time.[lr]::
2055::$$$message_0017_0005_0002$$$::That works out well, since I've just finished cleaning.::
2056::$$$message_0017_0006_0000$$$::"Sorry I made you wait. I was thinking of having you teach me here..."[lr]::
2057::$$$message_0017_0006_0001$$$::"Yes? Is something the matter, Shirou? You look like you have just seen something unusual."::
2058::$$$message_0017_0007_0000$$$::"Oh...it's nothing. I was just surprised that you're still in the same clothes. I thought you were going to wear your other outfit."[lr]::
2059::$$$message_0017_0007_0001$$$::We're training with swords, so I immediately thought of Saber in her armor, since that's what she always wears when she's fighting.::
2060::$$$message_0017_0008_0000$$$::"Huh. If you prefer me armored, I can change. You are right...I was not thinking.[lr]::
2061::$$$message_0017_0008_0001$$$::Even should we only be practicing, I am disrespecting you by not wearing my armor. My apologies. I will change right away."::
2062::$$$message_0017_0009_0000$$$::"Oh...uh, that's not what I mean. I just misunderstood. It's fine. I actually prefer you in this outfit to your armor."::
2063::$$$message_0017_0010_0000$$$::"Huh? Are you not saying my outfit is unsatisfactory?"[lr]::
2064::$$$message_0017_0010_0001$$$::"Unsatisfactory? I mean, you don't look like you're dressed for a bout right now, but it shouldn't matter as long as you're comfortable. Wearing armor all day will just tire you out."::
2065::$$$message_0017_0011_0000$$$::"That may be true...but don't you think this is an inappropriate look for wielding a sword?"[lr]::
2066::$$$message_0017_0011_0001$$$::"Why would you think that? It's not weird; you look good.[lr]::
2067::$$$message_0017_0011_0002$$$::I think you look better right now than you do in your armor."::
2068::$$$message_0017_0012_0000$$$::"I do not quite understand. This outfit is certainly easy to move in, but it is ill-suited for combat. I believe this is quite an inadequate look for a Saber."[lr]::
2069::$$$message_0017_0012_0001$$$::"Don't you dare wear that outfit in a fight, dummy. You're a girl, Saber. Girls look good in outfits like this, so this is fine."::
2070::$$$message_0017_0013_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
2071::$$$message_0017_0013_0001$$$::I return the rag I'd been cleaning with to the bucket, and I bring back two shinai that had been leaning against a wall.::
2072::$$$message_0017_0014_0000$$$::"So what are you planning for training, Saber? I'm leaving everything to you to decide, so tell me anything, no matter how absurd it might be."[lr]::
2073::$$$message_0017_0014_0001$$$::I toss her the bamboo sword.::
2074::$$$message_0017_0015_0000$$$::Saber seems distracted as she catches the shinai and stares at me quietly.::
2075::$$$message_0017_0016_0000$$$::"Huh? Is there a problem with bamboo swords?[lr]::
2076::$$$message_0017_0016_0001$$$::D-don't tell me you want to use wooden[line2]or even real blades!?"[lr]::
2077::$$$message_0017_0016_0002$$$::She's really a tough instructor! This is beyond anything I imagined!::
2078::$$$message_0017_0017_0000$$$::"Oh...no, that is not it. These are certainly excellent mock swords for practice sessions, so let us use them."[lr]::
2079::$$$message_0017_0017_0001$$$::Saber draws in a deep breath...[lr]::
2080::$$$message_0017_0017_0002$$$::...and goes right back to being the normal Saber as I know her.::
2081::$$$message_0017_0018_0000$$$::"That's a relief. It'd be too noisy to spar with wooden swords.[lr]::
2082::$$$message_0017_0018_0001$$$::So, what are we going to do? Are you going to make me strengthen my body by swinging the sword five hundred times or run laps?"::
2083::$$$message_0017_0019_0000$$$::"That will not be necessary. From what I've observed, your athletic abilities are above average. If we intended to further fortify your body, it would take more than a day or two."::
2084::$$$message_0017_0020_0000$$$::"You may be unskilled as a mage, but you are not bad as a warrior. You must have trained hard from a young age."[lr]::
2085::$$$message_0017_0020_0001$$$::"Uh...well, that's all I was really good at. You don't have to be talented in magecraft to work out physically."::
2086::$$$message_0017_0021_0000$$$::"That must have worked in your favor. One of the reasons you survived Lancer's attack must be that very training."::
2087::$$$message_0017_0022_0000$$$::"But it will not be enough for you to defend yourself.[lr]::
2088::$$$message_0017_0022_0001$$$::Humans are bound by limitations. Your body has not yet reached its limit, and breaking through that limit would be difficult.[lr]::
2089::$$$message_0017_0022_0002$$$::That is why I will be teaching you only one thing: how to fight."::
2090::$$$message_0017_0023_0000$$$::"What do you mean, just fight? Based on your tone, it doesn't sound like you'll teach me [font italic=true]how[font italic=false] to fight."::
2091::$$$message_0017_0024_0000$$$::"Of course not. The techniques employed in battle cannot be learned overnight. All I can do is make certain Master experiences as many battles as possible.[lr]::
2092::$$$message_0017_0024_0001$$$::I am not a skilled teacher, so I am baffled that you would seek my guidance."::
2093::$$$message_0017_0025_0000$$$::"...Um, hello?"[lr]::
2094::$$$message_0017_0025_0001$$$::Having her sound so proud about that makes it a bit awkward for me as her student.::
2095::$$$message_0017_0026_0000$$$::"Uh...so, we're just going to have a bunch of matches?"[lr]::
2096::$$$message_0017_0026_0001$$$::"Yes. That is all, Master.[lr]::
2097::$$$message_0017_0026_0002$$$::We shall not soften our blows; we will fight as if we mean to kill each other.[lr]::
2098::$$$message_0017_0026_0003$$$::Well, you will understand after perhaps an hour."::
2099::$$$message_0017_0027_0000$$$::Saber readies herself, gently gripping her shinai.[lr]::
2100::$$$message_0017_0027_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Huh?[font italic=false][lr]::
2101::$$$message_0017_0027_0002$$$::I tilt my head, wondering what she means, but I also grip my shinai as Saber does.[lr]::
2102::$$$message_0017_0027_0003$$$::In that instant...[lr]::
2103::$$$message_0017_0027_0004$$$::My vision goes black.::
2104::$$$message_0017_0028_0000$$$::Saber is teaching me one very simple lesson: [lr]::
2105::$$$message_0017_0028_0001$$$::No matter what I do...[lr]::
2106::$$$message_0017_0028_0002$$$::No matter what strategy I come up with...[lr]::
2107::$$$message_0017_0028_0003$$$::None of it will change the outcome of a fight against someone I just don't have a chance of beating.::
2108::$$$message_0017_0029_0000$$$::"Haaa...haaah...ah...ha...haaa...ouch. That hurt! It's definitely broken!"::
2109::$$$message_0017_0030_0000$$$::"If it were broken, your arm would look far worse. It may be a bad bruise, but you will recover soon."[lr]::
2110::$$$message_0017_0030_0001$$$::"...Tch. Okay. Then let's keep going."::
2111::$$$message_0017_0031_0000$$$::"Huh? Do you intend to continue, Shirou?[lr]::
2112::$$$message_0017_0031_0001$$$::It may be a bruise, but you should not move again so quickly."::
2113::$$$message_0017_0032_0000$$$::"...Says the person who didn't hesitate to charge at my arm.[lr]::
2114::$$$message_0017_0032_0001$$$::Fine. If you don't feel like it, I'll use this opportunity[line2]"[lr]::
2115::$$$message_0017_0032_0002$$$::I got her![lr]::
2116::$$$message_0017_0032_0003$$$::...Nope. Obviously.::
2117::$$$message_0017_0033_0000$$$::"Please listen to me. You are obviously fatigued. You must rest, or all our training will be in vain."::
2118::$$$message_0017_0034_0000$$$::"But it's disgraceful for you to beat me so badly when you're so obviously taking it easy on me![lr]::
2119::$$$message_0017_0034_0001$$$::If I can't even get you to so much as raise a brow, I'll be too frustrated to even collapse!"::
2120::$$$message_0017_0035_0000$$$::"If you want me to be surprised, I am plenty surprised. I knew you were stubborn, but I entirely failed to anticipate the extent."[lr]::
2121::$$$message_0017_0035_0001$$$::"Well sorry about that. I hate losing."::
2122::$$$message_0017_0036_0000$$$::"Yes. You have demonstrated that many times, so you needn't say so. We will be taking a break, so please put your bamboo sword down.[lr]::
2123::$$$message_0017_0036_0001$$$::The floor is slippery with sweat. We are not trying to carry out mock battles in extreme situations, so there is no point in carrying on while we are exhausted and on unstable footing."::
2124::$$$message_0017_0037_0000$$$::"Why not? I thought combat training was supposed to simulate worst-case scenarios. If not..."::
2125::$$$message_0017_0038_0000$$$::"That is even more pointless.[lr]::
2126::$$$message_0017_0038_0001$$$::Listen, Shirou. If you say you are going to fight against a Servant, doing so will be pointless unless you are in peak condition, have the best footing, and a prepared path of retreat.[lr]::
2127::$$$message_0017_0038_0002$$$::Unless the conditions are perfect, you will not be able to fight against a Servant. Your desire to fight while you are in the worst possible state is foolish in itself."::
2128::$$$message_0017_0039_0000$$$::"Ungh...so what you're saying is that I shouldn't even bother trying to fight in situations like this."[lr]::
2129::$$$message_0017_0039_0001$$$::"Exactly. In a situation like this, there is no miracle which would save you, Shirou.[lr]::
2130::$$$message_0017_0039_0002$$$::Your best way to fight should be to fully prepare yourself, then pursue the best course of action in a given situation."::
2131::$$$message_0017_0040_0000$$$::"...Got it. Then I'd like to take a break."[lr]::
2132::$$$message_0017_0040_0001$$$::I slump against the wall and slowly slide down to the floor.::
2133::$$$message_0017_0041_0000$$$::"Phew."[lr]::
2134::$$$message_0017_0041_0001$$$::I exhale.[lr]::
2135::$$$message_0017_0041_0002$$$::Air should be what I feel coming from my lungs, but instead there is only heat.::
2136::$$$message_0017_0042_0000$$$::"...Ouch."[lr]::
2137::$$$message_0017_0042_0001$$$::While my body is throbbing with pain, I glance towards the clock on the wall.[lr]::
2138::$$$message_0017_0042_0002$$$::It's a little past eleven o'clock.[lr]::
2139::$$$message_0017_0042_0003$$$::We started around nine, so we've been sparring for about two hours.::
2140::$$$message_0017_0043_0000$$$::During the first hour, I was just getting beaten up.[lr]::
2141::$$$message_0017_0043_0001$$$::Saber struck suddenly, then I blacked out.[lr]::
2142::$$$message_0017_0043_0002$$$::I woke up, thinking I would be more careful, and then just got knocked right back out.[lr]::
2143::$$$message_0017_0043_0003$$$::After getting beaten up repeatedly, my body seemed to get used to it, or maybe my anger just triggered some latent power, but eventually I did manage to block the first blow.::
2144::$$$message_0017_0044_0000$$$::The problem came after that.[lr]::
2145::$$$message_0017_0044_0001$$$::Here's a thought: Would humans dare to, or even be [font italic=true]able[font italic=false] to fight back against an opponent who is so much stronger and more skilled?::
2146::$$$message_0017_0045_0000$$$::"...You oni."[lr]::
2147::$$$message_0017_0045_0001$$$::The answer was no, because I blacked out the instant I flinched.[lr]::
2148::$$$message_0017_0045_0002$$$::After that, it was just a repeated show of a cat cornering a rat.::
2149::$$$message_0017_0046_0000$$$::If, no matter how I tried to block the attack, I was just going to fall, mortally wounded, then I had no choice but to attack in desperation.[lr]::
2150::$$$message_0017_0046_0001$$$::Of course, she deflected my attacks easily and knocked me out. But as I got used to it...[lr]::
2151::$$$message_0017_0046_0002$$$::I started getting enough time and awareness to intuit that the next attack would kill me. So I had just enough time to think to myself,[r]::
2152::$$$message_0017_0046_0003$$$::[font italic=true]"Oh crap."[font italic=false][lr]::
2153::$$$message_0017_0046_0004$$$::I guess in a general sense, I was getting into the swing of things.::
2154::$$$message_0017_0047_0000$$$::So after that, I went on the defensive.[lr]::
2155::$$$message_0017_0047_0001$$$::My intuition kept screaming that the next attack would knock me out, so I tried to avoid it, like any living thing would.::
2156::$$$message_0017_0048_0000$$$::I managed to parry Saber's shinai attacks as they rained down upon me, and while I waited for an opening to counterattack, she struck a fatal blow.[lr]::
2157::$$$message_0017_0048_0001$$$::I managed to stand up and think that next time I'd last longer, then think maybe I should just go on the offensive before she can strike, since I couldn't hold out anyway.::
2158::$$$message_0017_0049_0000$$$::And that went on for two hours.[lr]::
2159::$$$message_0017_0049_0001$$$::...I'm not sure this is going to make me stronger.[lr]::
2160::$$$message_0017_0049_0002$$$::But I do think it's helping me get used to fighting.::
2161::$$$message_0017_0050_0000$$$::Practice so I'm neither confused nor too calm in the face of the enemy.[lr]::
2162::$$$message_0017_0050_0001$$$::All I'm doing is teaching myself that I'm a single mistake away from death.::
2163::$$$message_0017_0051_0000$$$::But...if you asked me if I thought this was meaningless, I'd say no.[lr]::
2164::$$$message_0017_0051_0001$$$::With no effective weapon to use, the feeling of constantly being on edge is the most important thing I have.::
2165::$$$message_0017_0052_0000$$$::"A job well done. Are you hurt anywhere, Shirou?"::
2166::$$$message_0017_0053_0000$$$::The next thing I know, Saber is right next to me.[lr]::
2167::$$$message_0017_0053_0001$$$::I'm so exhausted, I'm dripping sweat all over the floor. Saber isn't even breathing hard.::
2168::$$$message_0017_0054_0000$$$::"It'd be hard to find anywhere that doesn't hurt at this point.[lr]::
2169::$$$message_0017_0054_0001$$$::You really didn't hold back, Saber. It actually felt extraordinary having you just come at me without even having a chance of defending myself."[lr]::
2170::$$$message_0017_0054_0002$$$::I have to admit, I'm saying that entirely because I'm a sore loser.::
2171::$$$message_0017_0055_0000$$$::"Yes. I did try to bring myself down to your level, but I also tried to show you no mercy. No real battle will ever involve making things easy for you."::
2172::$$$message_0017_0056_0000$$$::"Yeah. Thanks to this training, I think I can calmly deal with a Doberman running at me with its leash off.[lr]::
2173::$$$message_0017_0056_0001$$$::...Then again, I wouldn't be good enough yet if it's just a Doberman, so I'll still need more training."::
2174::$$$message_0017_0057_0000$$$::I'm in a moment of honest reflection.[lr]::
2175::$$$message_0017_0057_0001$$$::I've always thought I trained myself more than the average person, but now I'm ashamed for throwing in the towel after just two hours of sparring with Saber.::
2176::$$$message_0017_0058_0000$$$::"That is not true. Your attacks were all quite powerful. I was so enthused by your efforts that I forgot to strike back at times."::
2177::$$$message_0017_0059_0000$$$::"Oh?"[lr]::
2178::$$$message_0017_0059_0001$$$::I'm suddenly embarrassed again.[lr]::
2179::$$$message_0017_0059_0002$$$::For a while, we'd just been two people sparring with our shinai with no thought given to being a man and a woman, but now...she's caught me off guard.::
2180::$$$message_0017_0060_0000$$$::"Uh...hold on. I'm going to go drink some water."[lr]::
2181::$$$message_0017_0060_0001$$$::"Water? I will fetch you some. Please stay here and rest."[lr]::
2182::$$$message_0017_0060_0002$$$::Saber goes to get some water.::
2183::$$$message_0017_0061_0000$$$::"Whew...that was a close one."[lr]::
2184::$$$message_0017_0061_0001$$$::...Huh.[lr]::
2185::$$$message_0017_0061_0002$$$::Close? What was so close...?::
2186::$$$message_0017_0062_0000$$$::I drink the water Saber brings me.[lr]::
2187::$$$message_0017_0062_0001$$$::It must still be break time, as Saber's sitting formally in a kneeling position.::
2188::$$$message_0017_0063_0000$$$::Saber is so beautiful when she does that kind of thing.[lr]::
2189::$$$message_0017_0063_0001$$$::I'm not saying that as a man finding a woman attractive, but because I find her beautiful as a human being.::
2190::$$$message_0017_0064_0000$$$::It's still strange to think that she is Saber, a Servant, and someone dedicated to fighting.::
2191::$$$message_0017_0065_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2192::$$$message_0017_0065_0001$$$::Right now, there's only me and Saber.[lr]::
2193::$$$message_0017_0065_0002$$$::This might be a good opportunity for me to strike up a conversation, so I'll ask[line2][lr]:©î
