18599::$$$message_0172_0000_0000$$$::This is a well-known dagger...perhaps even famous.[lr]::
18600::$$$message_0172_0000_0001$$$::It is used for rituals rather than for battle. It's a magical wand in the shape of a sword, used to form magic circles and to intervene in Mystics that have taken shape.::
18601::$$$message_0172_0001_0000$$$::The word "AZOTH" is engraved in the jewel on the handle.[lr]::
18602::$$$message_0172_0001_0001$$$::Its blade isn't as long as a typical dagger, which probably fits Tohsaka's preferences anyway.[lr]::
18603::$$$message_0172_0001_0002$$$::This is the Azoth Blade, a sword favored by a famous scholar of Mystics who took the world by storm some time ago.[lr]::
18604::$$$message_0172_0001_0003$$$::It is meant for mages, to prove that their training is complete. The Azoth Blade is not unlike the sort of gift one receives for getting into a college.::
18605::$$$message_0172_0002_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, what is this?"[lr]::
18606::$$$message_0172_0002_0001$$$::"Can't you tell? This is my dagger. It's weak compared to my jewels, but I still infuse it with magical energy from time to time. It'll activate if you say läßt and flood it with as much magical energy as you can."::
18607::$$$message_0172_0003_0000$$$::She hands me the dagger. It's surprisingly heavy.[lr]::
18608::$$$message_0172_0003_0001$$$::Not physically heavy. Rather, I feel the weight of Tohsaka's memories in the dagger.::
18609::$$$message_0172_0004_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. Are you sure about loaning this to me?"[lr]::
18610::$$$message_0172_0004_0001$$$::"It's fine. I knew I was no match for Kirei, so I hid it from him. I don't want it to go to waste, so you use it."::
18611::$$$message_0172_0005_0000$$$::"Okay, I'll take it. Honestly, more weapons can't hurt."[lr]::
18612::$$$message_0172_0005_0001$$$::"Oh, so you do get it. Then...maybe it's time...[lr]::
18613::$$$message_0172_0005_0002$$$::I'm just getting so sleepy..."::
18614::$$$message_0172_0006_0000$$$::She laughs, embarrassed.[lr]::
18615::$$$message_0172_0006_0001$$$::The next thing I know...[lr]::
18616::$$$message_0172_0006_0002$$$::Saber is standing behind me, waiting to treat Tohsaka.::
18617::$$$message_0172_0007_0000$$$::"Yeah. Go ahead and sleep. I'll wake you up in the morning. Then I'll make you a nice, big meal."[lr]::
18618::$$$message_0172_0007_0001$$$::"Yeah, I'll do that.[lr]::
18619::$$$message_0172_0007_0002$$$::Oh, and this last bit is more of an order than a warning.[lr]::
18620::$$$message_0172_0007_0003$$$::Shirou...if you're going to do this, you need to win even if it kills you. I will never, ever forgive you if I wake up and find you dead and defeated."::
18621::$$$message_0172_0008_0000$$$::She looks like she's said everything she wants to say.[lr]::
18622::$$$message_0172_0008_0001$$$::And so Tohsaka drifts right off to sleep.[lr]::
18623::$$$message_0172_0008_0002$$$::She looks well enough, so I feel a little stupid for worrying about her.::
18624::$$$message_0172_0009_0000$$$::But then again...[lr]::
18625::$$$message_0172_0009_0001$$$::I know that's her way of cheering me on, and her words really do invigorate me.[lr]::
18626::$$$message_0172_0009_0002$$$::"Yeah. Leave it to me, Tohsaka."[lr]::
18627::$$$message_0172_0009_0003$$$::I nod at Tohsaka's sleeping form.::
18628::$$$message_0172_0010_0000$$$::Everything's all set.[lr]::
18629::$$$message_0172_0010_0001$$$::All that's left is to spend these next few hours without regret, while my wounds heal.::
18630::$$$message_0172_0011_0000$$$::Today slowly ticks over into tomorrow.[lr]::
18631::$$$message_0172_0011_0001$$$::We treat Tohsaka's wounds and take her to her room to rest, while I make dinner and eat with Saber in silence.::
18632::$$$message_0172_0012_0000$$$::"Just a little longer..."[lr]::
18633::$$$message_0172_0012_0001$$$::Most of my wounds are healed.[lr]::
18634::$$$message_0172_0012_0002$$$::We only have about an hour or two left.[lr]::
18635::$$$message_0172_0012_0003$$$::In the meantime, I'll...[lr]::
