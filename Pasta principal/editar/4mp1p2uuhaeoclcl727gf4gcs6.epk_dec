38106::$$$message_0329_0000_0000$$$::  Caster extends her fingers.::
38107::$$$message_0329_0001_0000$$$::"Damn... It..."[lr]::
38108::$$$message_0329_0001_0001$$$::I try to fight back, but my body won't move.[lr]::
38109::$$$message_0329_0001_0002$$$::My limbs aren't responding, my senses are being taken away, and I'm sure she's going to off me.::
38110::$$$message_0329_0002_0000$$$::"Goodbye, boy. Regret that you became a Master with such little talent as you have."[lr]::
38111::$$$message_0329_0002_0001$$$::My body doesn't move at all and accepts the finger tip of death.::
38112::$$$message_0329_0003_0000$$$::"Nnng...!"[lr]::
38113::$$$message_0329_0003_0001$$$::I resist the urge to close my eyes and keep glaring at Caster with all my might.::
38114::$$$message_0329_0004_0000$$$::"Wow. Good boy, I can't say I dislike that in a person."[lr]::
38115::$$$message_0329_0004_0001$$$::Caster snickers at my utmost resistance and puts her fingers on my Command Spells.::
38116::$$$message_0329_0005_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
38117::$$$message_0329_0005_0001$$$::...Even my free will is going numb.[lr]::
38118::$$$message_0329_0005_0002$$$::...In my fading thoughts...[lr]::
38119::$$$message_0329_0005_0003$$$::I...[lr]::
38120::$$$message_0329_0005_0004$$$::...I hear the sound of clashing swords from the temple gate behind me.::
38121::$$$message_0329_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]![font italic=false][lr]::
38122::$$$message_0329_0006_0001$$$::What kind of miracle is this?[lr]::
38123::$$$message_0329_0006_0002$$$::I hear the sound of dozens of objects splitting the air, followed by numerous arrows piercing the ground in front of me.[lr]::
38124::$$$message_0329_0006_0003$$$::Caster instantly retreats, her black robe swirling like a spinning top.::
38125::$$$message_0329_0007_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
38126::$$$message_0329_0007_0001$$$::There are arrows piercing the ground by her feet.[lr]::
38127::$$$message_0329_0007_0002$$$::Thirteen of them fired from the direction of the temple gate.[lr]::
38128::$$$message_0329_0007_0003$$$::They were probably fired in rapid succession, and Caster would've been struck center mass had there been one more in the volley.::
38129::$$$message_0329_0008_0000$$$::The one who fired stands there, atop the gate.[lr]::
38130::$$$message_0329_0008_0001$$$::The knight in red then jumps down to ground level, his hands empty.::
38131::$$$message_0329_0009_0000$$$::"Heh. I thought you'd be dead by now, but you're more persistent than I thought."[lr]::
38132::$$$message_0329_0009_0001$$$::Archer moves to stand before me, as if to protect me.::
38133::$$$message_0329_0010_0000$$$::"You... Why...?"[lr]::
38134::$$$message_0329_0010_0001$$$::"What? I just happened to be in the area. Don't worry about it.[lr]::
38135::$$$message_0329_0010_0002$$$::...So, how's your body? That should've cut Caster's string."::
38136::$$$message_0329_0011_0000$$$::"Huh..."[lr]::
38137::$$$message_0329_0011_0001$$$::I check my hand.[lr]::
38138::$$$message_0329_0011_0002$$$::...It moves.[lr]::
38139::$$$message_0329_0011_0003$$$::My frozen limbs must've regained mobility from that earlier action.::
38140::$$$message_0329_0012_0000$$$::"I can move. Caster's spell is gone, but..."[lr]::
38141::$$$message_0329_0012_0001$$$::"That's good. I want to tell you to do what you want now, but... If you don't want to get killed, then stay there for a while. One wrong move..."::
38142::$$$message_0329_0013_0000$$$::"Khh, Archer...!? Ugh, what is Assassin doing...!"[lr]::
38143::$$$message_0329_0013_0001$$$::"See, she'll take her anger out on you.[lr]::
38144::$$$message_0329_0013_0002$$$::Hell hath no fury, as they say. What a pain in the ass this is gonna be."[lr]::
38145::$$$message_0329_0013_0003$$$::Archer laughs. I can't tell how serious he is.::
38146::$$$message_0329_0014_0000$$$::"...Well. Don't get too mad, Caster.[lr]::
38147::$$$message_0329_0014_0001$$$::Assassin is fighting Saber. I don't know who that samurai is, but he is quite a swordsman to be able to hold Saber back.[lr]::
38148::$$$message_0329_0014_0002$$$::Shouldn't you be praising him instead?"::
38149::$$$message_0329_0015_0000$$$::Even though he's facing an enemy, there's no tension in his voice or body language at all.[lr]::
38150::$$$message_0329_0015_0001$$$::Caster must've noticed that, and regains her composure.::
38151::$$$message_0329_0016_0000$$$::"...Hmph, don't be ridiculous. You cannot call him a Heroic Spirit if he can't even stop you. That man lacks ability despite calling himself a swordsman."::
38152::$$$message_0329_0017_0000$$$::"Oh. You sound as if Assassin is your ally... So your Masters are cooperating after all.[lr]::
38153::$$$message_0329_0017_0001$$$::If not, then it wouldn't explain this situation of two Servants in the same place."::
38154::$$$message_0329_0018_0000$$$::Caster stares at Archer silently.[lr]::
38155::$$$message_0329_0018_0001$$$::I can't see her expression well beneath her hood, but she looks as if she's agitated.::
38156::$$$message_0329_0019_0000$$$::"...Archer, is that true...!? Assassin and Caster's Masters are cooperating...!?"::
38157::$$$message_0329_0020_0000$$$::"Yeah. Assassin is guarding the outside of the gate, and Caster is hiding inside. It's pretty obvious that these two have made a truce.[lr]::
38158::$$$message_0329_0020_0001$$$::It is not rare for Masters to be cooperating with each other. You and Rin are cooperating, remember?"::
38159::$$$message_0329_0021_0000$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
38160::$$$message_0329_0021_0001$$$::That's right.[lr]::
38161::$$$message_0329_0021_0002$$$::   Then, there are two Masters at this Ryudou Temple...!?::
38162::$$$message_0329_0022_0000$$$::"Heh...[lr]::
38163::$$$message_0329_0022_0001$$$::Hehe...hahaha! I was wondering what you were going to say, but you are so off, Archer!"::
38164::$$$message_0329_0023_0000$$$::"Hm? Oh, I'm wrong? ...Man, I was confident that you two were allies."::
38165::$$$message_0329_0024_0000$$$::"Yes, you are terribly wrong.[lr]::
38166::$$$message_0329_0024_0001$$$::Allies, you said...? Me cooperating with that dog? With the man under my control?"::
38167::$$$message_0329_0025_0000$$$::Her laugh is so out of place that the tense atmosphere disperses.::
38168::$$$message_0329_0026_0000$$$::Contrarily...[lr]::
38169::$$$message_0329_0026_0001$$$::Archer grits his teeth.::
38170::$$$message_0329_0027_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
38171::$$$message_0329_0027_0001$$$::Something finally comes out.[lr]::
38172::$$$message_0329_0027_0002$$$::It's not Caster's enmity nor the swirl of magical energy surrounding the temple.[lr]::
38173::$$$message_0329_0027_0003$$$::For the first time since he came here...[lr]::
38174::$$$message_0329_0027_0004$$$::Archer is showing open hostility.::
38175::$$$message_0329_0028_0000$$$::"Yes, your hunch is correct, Archer.[lr]::
38176::$$$message_0329_0028_0001$$$::My Master is not cooperating with anyone, nor is Assassin's Master.[lr]::
38177::$$$message_0329_0028_0002$$$::No, first of all, Assassin does not have a Master!"::
38178::$$$message_0329_0029_0000$$$::"The...hell?"[lr]::
38179::$$$message_0329_0029_0001$$$::Assassin doesn't have a Master...?[lr]::
38180::$$$message_0329_0029_0002$$$::What does that mean?[lr]::
38181::$$$message_0329_0029_0003$$$::Servants cannot exist without a Master.[lr]::
38182::$$$message_0329_0029_0004$$$::Weren't they supposed to disappear if they don't have a supply of magical energy...?::
38183::$$$message_0329_0030_0000$$$::"...Caster. You've broken the rules."::
38184::$$$message_0329_0031_0000$$$::"Of course not. I have not broken any rules. Mages summon Servants, right?[lr]::
38185::$$$message_0329_0031_0001$$$::Then, what is the problem with a Caster, a mage, summoning a Servant!?"::
38186::$$$message_0329_0032_0000$$$::The witch in black robes proclaims with a sneer.[lr]::
38187::$$$message_0329_0032_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38188::$$$message_0329_0032_0002$$$::...So that means...[lr]::
38189::$$$message_0329_0032_0003$$$::The Assassin-class Servant at the temple gate is a Heroic Spirit summoned by Caster...!::
38190::$$$message_0329_0033_0000$$$::"...A Servant controlling a Servant, huh... I see, so he's a fictitious Heroic Spirit.[lr]::
38191::$$$message_0329_0033_0001$$$::As Assassin was not summoned by a proper Master, something other than a proper assassin must've been called. Eh, not that I care. Whatever the origins of the spirit, the job remains the same.[lr]::
38192::$$$message_0329_0033_0002$$$::Though I would hazard to say you made this choice unilaterally, eh?"::
38193::$$$message_0329_0034_0000$$$::"...Fine, I'll ask. How did you come to that conclusion, Archer?"::
38194::$$$message_0329_0035_0000$$$::"Oh, it's just a hunch. Masters are mages.[lr]::
38195::$$$message_0329_0035_0001$$$::When a mage summons a spellcaster that is superior to them...I imagine their relationship isn't a normal Master-Servant one.[lr]::
38196::$$$message_0329_0035_0002$$$::The Master-mage would always be on guard against the superior Caster-mage that they summoned.[lr]::
38197::$$$message_0329_0035_0003$$$::...If I were your Master, I wouldn't be inclined to let a witch freely move about. There is no way that they'd allow you to summon another Servant that follows your orders, rather than theirs."::
38198::$$$message_0329_0036_0000$$$::"...Heh. It seems you have some intelligence.[lr]::
38199::$$$message_0329_0036_0001$$$::I will overlook your insult in lieu of your cleverness."::
38200::$$$message_0329_0037_0000$$$::Caster snickers, though she watches Archer carefully.[lr]::
38201::$$$message_0329_0037_0001$$$::...The only thing between them is enmity.[lr]::
38202::$$$message_0329_0037_0002$$$::They're about seven meters apart.[lr]::
38203::$$$message_0329_0037_0003$$$::With the charge that Archer showed at school, he should be able to slash Caster before she even finishes chanting an incantation.::
38204::$$$message_0329_0038_0000$$$::"I understand now. Saber, Lancer, and Rider have strong Magic Resistance. The guy behind me doesn't even compare; it's on another level.[lr]::
38205::$$$message_0329_0038_0001$$$::You'd have a hard time affecting them with magecraft. So you can't compete since you're stuck with spellwork."::
38206::$$$message_0329_0039_0000$$$::"In that case, it's natural for you to resort to underhanded tactics.[lr]::
38207::$$$message_0329_0039_0001$$$::You broke the rules to summon an Assassin-class Servant yourself...[lr]::
38208::$$$message_0329_0039_0002$$$::Created territory here and collected souls from the people in town...[lr]::
38209::$$$message_0329_0039_0003$$$::And you don't fight yourself, instead opting to watch the war's movements from afar.[lr]::
38210::$$$message_0329_0039_0004$$$::Going so far, I assume that you have your Master basically tied up somewhere. Stuck a puppet like this dipshit Master behind me."::
38211::$$$message_0329_0040_0000$$$::She smiles silently.[lr]::
38212::$$$message_0329_0040_0001$$$::That sends a chill up my spine.[lr]::
38213::$$$message_0329_0040_0002$$$::She's not only collecting magical energy from the people in town.[lr]::
38214::$$$message_0329_0040_0003$$$::She's even using her own Master as her own tool just like she did to me...::
38215::$$$message_0329_0041_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38216::$$$message_0329_0041_0001$$$::...Caster is dangerous.[lr]::
38217::$$$message_0329_0041_0002$$$::She's not a pure threat like Berserker, but those who make the situation worse without showing themselves are always the most problematic in a war.::
38218::$$$message_0329_0042_0000$$$::"Yes. You are correct, Archer.[lr]::
38219::$$$message_0329_0042_0001$$$::But you are wrong if you believe that I am no match for you people.[lr]::
38220::$$$message_0329_0042_0002$$$::It is easy for me to win the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
38221::$$$message_0329_0042_0003$$$::I am working hard as I am thinking ahead. I am not working out a strategy out of fear of you people."::
38222::$$$message_0329_0043_0000$$$::"...Oh? Did you say that it's easy to defeat us, Caster? Pretty words for a witch that flees all the time."::
38223::$$$message_0329_0044_0000$$$::"You heard me. If it's here, I am stronger than anyone else. Berserker and Saber aside, you won't be able to even scratch me."::
38224::$$$message_0329_0045_0000$$$::"You should be the one who considers fleeing.[lr]::
38225::$$$message_0329_0045_0001$$$::I forgave you once. But there won't be a second time.[lr]::
38226::$$$message_0329_0045_0002$$$::I will dole out the appropriate punishment to those who call me a witch."::
38227::$$$message_0329_0046_0000$$$::Caster's robe distorts.[lr]::
38228::$$$message_0329_0046_0001$$$::The magical energy in the air becomes a dense fog covering Caster's body.[lr]::
38229::$$$message_0329_0046_0002$$$::With that in front of him...[lr]::
38230::$$$message_0329_0046_0003$$$::"...Interesting. Not even a scratch, you said?"[lr]::
38231::$$$message_0329_0046_0004$$$::Though he's barely audible, Archer sounds amused.::
38232::$$$message_0329_0047_0000$$$::"Yes. You will not even be able to touch me."[lr]::
38233::$$$message_0329_0047_0001$$$::The black shadow responds.[lr]::
38234::$$$message_0329_0047_0002$$$::The knight in red laughs.::
38235::$$$message_0329_0048_0000$$$::"Then I'll take a shot. If I fail, I'll leave the rest to Saber."[lr]::
38236::$$$message_0329_0048_0001$$$::He flies like a squall towards the black shadow.::
38237::$$$message_0329_0049_0000$$$::The red shadow runs.[lr]::
38238::$$$message_0329_0049_0001$$$::I don't know when he got them, but in Archer's hands are those weapons...twin swords.::
38239::$$$message_0329_0050_0000$$$::"Oh...!"[lr]::
38240::$$$message_0329_0050_0001$$$::He does not allow any time for chanting incantations.[lr]::
38241::$$$message_0329_0050_0002$$$::Archer closes in on Caster before she can extend her arm.[lr]::
38242::$$$message_0329_0050_0003$$$::He slashes her in half with those twin blades.::
38243::$$$message_0329_0051_0000$$$::The robe, cut in half, scatters in the wind.[lr]::
38244::$$$message_0329_0051_0001$$$::"Hm..."[lr]::
38245::$$$message_0329_0051_0002$$$::Archer seems disappointed, standing in front of the remains of the enemy he just defeated so easily.::
38246::$$$message_0329_0052_0000$$$::It looked disappointing.[lr]::
38247::$$$message_0329_0052_0001$$$::She talked so big, yet she lost without even attacking him once.[lr]::
38248::$$$message_0329_0052_0002$$$::Anyone would feel let down.::
38249::$$$message_0329_0053_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
38250::$$$message_0329_0053_0001$$$::Archer is still gripping the twin swords.[lr]::
38251::$$$message_0329_0053_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
38252::$$$message_0329_0053_0003$$$::A red knight.[lr]::
38253::$$$message_0329_0053_0004$$$::The black and white short swords are magnificent to behold.[lr]::
38254::$$$message_0329_0053_0005$$$::...Strange.[lr]::
38255::$$$message_0329_0053_0006$$$::My eye really keeps getting drawn to them.::
38256::$$$message_0329_0054_0000$$$::...Those twin swords.[lr]::
38257::$$$message_0329_0054_0001$$$::They must be great swords with history, but I don't feel any malice from them.[lr]::
38258::$$$message_0329_0054_0002$$$::Noble Phantasms are supposed to be fantastic weapons, so it only makes sense that they're beautifully crafted.[lr]::
38259::$$$message_0329_0054_0003$$$::If Saber's sword was visible, I have to imagine it'd likewise be majestic.::
38260::$$$message_0329_0055_0000$$$::These swords, however, are different.[lr]::
38261::$$$message_0329_0055_0001$$$::A sword with the clear purpose of defeating opponents.[lr]::
38262::$$$message_0329_0055_0002$$$::A sword that was made to leave a mark on history.[lr]::
38263::$$$message_0329_0055_0003$$$::A sword forged to surpass the skill and craft of another.[lr]::
38264::$$$message_0329_0055_0004$$$::A sword intended to do some great deed.[lr]::
38265::$$$message_0329_0055_0005$$$::These blades have none of that. They're nothing like a blade with a famed story or magical lineage.::
38266::$$$message_0329_0056_0000$$$::If anything, it seemed like they were made because someone just...wanted to.[lr]::
38267::$$$message_0329_0056_0001$$$::There's something raw about them, unalloyed even. Made like their creator questioned their own significance. [lr]::
38268::$$$message_0329_0056_0002$$$::That's what I think those are.[lr]::
38269::$$$message_0329_0056_0003$$$::Mirrored swords without vanity.[lr]::
38270::$$$message_0329_0056_0004$$$::Black and white. A swordsmith's awkward representation of yin and yang.::
38271::$$$message_0329_0057_0000$$$::    I stand captivated.[lr]::
38272::$$$message_0329_0057_0001$$$::    Because...I feel like the way they are is beautiful.::
38273::$$$message_0329_0058_0000$$$::Caster's slashed body disappears.[lr]::
38274::$$$message_0329_0058_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38275::$$$message_0329_0058_0002$$$::After seeing it off, the moment Archer looks like he's going to put his weapons away[line2]::
38276::$$$message_0329_0059_0000$$$::"I'm disappointed, Archer. You really are weak."::
38277::$$$message_0329_0060_0000$$$::Caster's voice echoes throughout the desolate temple.::
38278::$$$message_0329_0061_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
38279::$$$message_0329_0061_0001$$$::Archer leaps.[lr]::
38280::$$$message_0329_0061_0002$$$::The barrage from earlier is mirrored.[lr]::
38281::$$$message_0329_0061_0003$$$::Bullets of light come flying from the sky to pierce Archer,[lr]::
38282::$$$message_0329_0061_0004$$$::and Archer repels them with his twin swords.[lr]::
38283::$$$message_0329_0061_0005$$$::   No...[lr]::
38284::$$$message_0329_0061_0006$$$::This is different from before.::
38285::$$$message_0329_0062_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
38286::$$$message_0329_0062_0001$$$::The ground is burnt red.[lr]::
38287::$$$message_0329_0062_0002$$$::The magical energy compressed within one of those lights is at least three times greater than my full capacity.[lr]::
38288::$$$message_0329_0062_0003$$$::I'm sure even Archer would have half his body blown away if he took a direct hit. He'd be just like Caster earlier.::
38289::$$$message_0329_0063_0000$$$::I look up at the sky.[lr]::
38290::$$$message_0329_0063_0001$$$::The moon isn't visible, veiled behind a sea of dark clouds.[lr]::
38291::$$$message_0329_0063_0002$$$::In the middle of that, the black mage floats as if she reigns over the heavens.::
38292::$$$message_0329_0064_0000$$$::"...It must be teleportation or time alteration. Whichever it is, you can get real close to True Magic within your territory.[lr]::
38293::$$$message_0329_0064_0001$$$::...I underestimated you, Caster. No, really, no wonder you talk a good game."::
38294::$$$message_0329_0065_0000$$$::While looking up at Caster, Archer adjusts the grip on his twin swords.::
38295::$$$message_0329_0066_0000$$$::"Is that so? Yet you are all disappointment, Archer.[lr]::
38296::$$$message_0329_0066_0001$$$::I tested you since I thought you might come in handy, but you're less than Assassin if this is the result."::
38297::$$$message_0329_0067_0000$$$::"Your words pain me. I can do better if you'd grace me with another chance."[lr]::
38298::$$$message_0329_0067_0001$$$::"...Of course not. Fools do not get second chances.[lr]::
38299::$$$message_0329_0067_0002$$$::Disappear now, Archer."::
38300::$$$message_0329_0068_0000$$$::"Shi[line2]!"[lr]::
38301::$$$message_0329_0068_0001$$$::Archer becomes a streak.[lr]::
38302::$$$message_0329_0068_0002$$$::He takes off at full speed to get clear from Caster and this place.::
38303::$$$message_0329_0069_0000$$$::"Heh, you think you can get away...!?"[lr]::
38304::$$$message_0329_0069_0001$$$::Caster's staff moves.[lr]::
38305::$$$message_0329_0069_0002$$$::The moment it points at Archer...[lr]::
38306::$$$message_0329_0069_0003$$$::Something absurd flashes before my very eyes.::
38307::$$$message_0329_0070_0000$$$::"N[line2]"[lr]::
38308::$$$message_0329_0070_0001$$$::No one can hear me say "No way!"::
38309::$$$message_0329_0071_0000$$$::Caster's attack is like a deluge of rain.[lr]::
38310::$$$message_0329_0071_0001$$$::The light that streaks down is like a bombing raid.[lr]::
38311::$$$message_0329_0071_0002$$$::Each spell is a deathblow, and Caster rains them down uninhibited. [lr]::
38312::$$$message_0329_0071_0003$$$::I may be green at this, but even I can tell how off the charts this magecraft is.::
38313::$$$message_0329_0072_0000$$$::This is more like a grand magecraft.[lr]::
38314::$$$message_0329_0072_0001$$$::Something like that requires a magic circle and a ten count instant contract...an incantation of at least ten lines.[lr]::
38315::$$$message_0329_0072_0002$$$::Because grand magecraft is powerful, it requires more time to cast it.[lr]::
38316::$$$message_0329_0072_0003$$$::A normal mage would take a minute to cast such magecraft.[lr]::
38317::$$$message_0329_0072_0004$$$::Even a mage that uses high-speed incantation would take thirty seconds.::
38318::$$$message_0329_0073_0000$$$::But she did it in an instant.[lr]::
38319::$$$message_0329_0073_0001$$$::She didn't even need an incantation and just pointed her staff. And she's using it continuously; I can't even think of anyone who would compare...!::
38320::$$$message_0329_0074_0000$$$::"Ugh...! You damn fox. You must have stored an incredible amount of magical energy to be able to fire A-rank magecraft in succession like this!"::
38321::$$$message_0329_0075_0000$$$::He must've decided that he can't avoid them all anymore, as Archer sprints while deflecting them with his twin swords.[lr]::
38322::$$$message_0329_0075_0001$$$::   Archer makes for the exit, but changes course halfway there as if he just remembered something.::
38323::$$$message_0329_0076_0000$$$::"You fool...![lr]::
38324::$$$message_0329_0076_0001$$$::How long are you just going to stand there!?"[lr]::
38325::$$$message_0329_0076_0002$$$::Archer charges towards me with a fierce look.::
38326::$$$message_0329_0077_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
38327::$$$message_0329_0077_0001$$$::That makes me realize.[lr]::
38328::$$$message_0329_0077_0002$$$::The place I'm standing is no longer safe.[lr]::
38329::$$$message_0329_0077_0003$$$::I'm already in the range of the rain of light...!::
38330::$$$message_0329_0078_0000$$$::"Damn it, why am I stuck doing this!?"[lr]::
38331::$$$message_0329_0078_0001$$$::Archer makes toward me.[lr]::
38332::$$$message_0329_0078_0002$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
38333::$$$message_0329_0078_0003$$$::The moment I try to jump back to avoid him...::
38334::$$$message_0329_0079_0000$$$::My body is flying through the air.::
38335::$$$message_0329_0080_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
38336::$$$message_0329_0080_0001$$$::I try to shake him off reflexively.[lr]::
38337::$$$message_0329_0080_0002$$$::...You've got to be shitting me.[lr]::
38338::$$$message_0329_0080_0003$$$::Archer's now carrying me!?::
38339::$$$message_0329_0081_0000$$$::"Ugh...! Let me down, you idiot! What the hell are you thinking!?"[lr]::
38340::$$$message_0329_0081_0001$$$::"How would I know! Shut up, hearing that from you is giving me a headache from how stupid I'm being, idiot!"::
38341::$$$message_0329_0082_0000$$$::"Idiot!? You call me an idiot knowing you're an idiot yourself!? You idiot!"[lr]::
38342::$$$message_0329_0082_0001$$$::"Ugh...! Hey, are you a child or something!? I don't know what you're gonna do if you're stupid and a child! At least pick one, you fool!"::
38343::$$$message_0329_0083_0000$$$::Archer must be wound up, as his words make no sense.[lr]::
38344::$$$message_0329_0083_0001$$$::But, even though he saved me, I just can't graciously accept.::
38345::$$$message_0329_0084_0000$$$::"You... Just let go of me! I can take care of myself! I don't need your help!"::
38346::$$$message_0329_0085_0000$$$::No, more than that, I can't bear being a hindrance to him.[lr]::
38347::$$$message_0329_0085_0001$$$::Archer should've been able to escape by now if it was just himself.[lr]::
38348::$$$message_0329_0085_0002$$$::But the exit is farther now that he's saved me.[lr]::
38349::$$$message_0329_0085_0003$$$::Archer running around the temple must be an easy target for Caster, who is above us.::
38350::$$$message_0329_0086_0000$$$::"Archer! Are you listening to me...!?"[lr]::
38351::$$$message_0329_0086_0001$$$::"...I see. Then I don't need to hold back."[lr]::
38352::$$$message_0329_0086_0002$$$::Then...[lr]::
38353::$$$message_0329_0086_0003$$$::Archer drop-kicks me.::
38354::$$$message_0329_0087_0000$$$::"Guh...!?"[lr]::
38355::$$$message_0329_0087_0001$$$::I tumble onto the ground.[lr]::
38356::$$$message_0329_0087_0002$$$::He must've kicked me hard, as I flew at least five meters.::
38357::$$$message_0329_0088_0000$$$::"You..."[lr]::
38358::$$$message_0329_0088_0001$$$::I endure the pain and get up.[lr]::
38359::$$$message_0329_0088_0002$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
38360::$$$message_0329_0088_0003$$$::Archer is still.[lr]::
38361::$$$message_0329_0088_0004$$$::The rain of light bullets has also stopped.[lr]::
38362::$$$message_0329_0088_0005$$$::All that remains is a feeling of cold that hurts my ears.::
38363::$$$message_0329_0089_0000$$$::"...Hey..."[lr]::
38364::$$$message_0329_0089_0001$$$::I finally get my bearings.[lr]::
38365::$$$message_0329_0089_0002$$$::The very air around Archer has frozen.::
38366::$$$message_0329_0090_0000$$$::"How are you feeling, Archer? Even as one of the three knights, you can't move if space itself is frozen."[lr]::
38367::$$$message_0329_0090_0001$$$::Caster's triumphant voice.[lr]::
38368::$$$message_0329_0090_0002$$$::Archer must not be able to talk. It's like time has stopped for him.::
38369::$$$message_0329_0091_0000$$$::"I guess this is it. Saber is outside, so I don't have any more time to waste on you.[lr]::
38370::$$$message_0329_0091_0001$$$::I don't know which Heroic Spirit you are, but this is goodbye, Archer."::
38371::$$$message_0329_0092_0000$$$::Caster raises her left hand.[lr]::
38372::$$$message_0329_0092_0001$$$::From that hand, the light bullet of instant death is dropped.[lr]::
38373::$$$message_0329_0092_0002$$$::But, right before that...[lr]::
38374::$$$message_0329_0092_0003$$$::Archer murmurs something.::
38375::$$$message_0329_0093_0000$$$::"Hmm? What is it, Archer? If you feel like begging for mercy, I may[line2]"[lr]::
38376::$$$message_0329_0093_0001$$$::"...said...Caster..."::
38377::$$$message_0329_0094_0000$$$::His tone is filled with irritation.[lr]::
38378::$$$message_0329_0094_0001$$$::I try to make out what he's saying, and[line2][lr]::
38379::$$$message_0329_0094_0002$$$::"...You fool, I said to dodge it, Caster!"[lr]::
38380::$$$message_0329_0094_0003$$$::Archer leaps away.::
38381::$$$message_0329_0095_0000$$$::He must've broken the frozen space with force.[lr]::
38382::$$$message_0329_0095_0001$$$::With the sound of breaking glass, Archer flashes out of sight.::
38383::$$$message_0329_0096_0000$$$::"W-what are[line2]"[lr]::
38384::$$$message_0329_0096_0001$$$::Distracted by Archer's angry shout, Caster is baffled.[lr]::
38385::$$$message_0329_0096_0002$$$::   And then to either side of her...[lr]::
38386::$$$message_0329_0096_0003$$$::A flash of black and white converge on her.::
38387::$$$message_0329_0097_0000$$$::"Guh!!!"[lr]::
38388::$$$message_0329_0097_0001$$$::Caster's robe tears.[lr]::
38389::$$$message_0329_0097_0002$$$::She must've been given just enough warning from Archer's shout and narrowly escapes the attack.::
38390::$$$message_0329_0098_0000$$$::It should not need explaining, but it is Archer's blades that fly by.::
38391::$$$message_0329_0099_0000$$$::   It was in an instant.[lr]::
38392::$$$message_0329_0099_0001$$$::Archer threw the twin swords to either side when he kicked me and got caught in the freezing spell.[lr]::
38393::$$$message_0329_0099_0002$$$::The blades boomeranged through the sky and made an arc back toward Caster.::
38394::$$$message_0329_0100_0000$$$::"Guess you gotta hand it to him... Wait, where did he go...[r]::
38395::$$$message_0329_0100_0001$$$::...Guh...!?"[lr]::
38396::$$$message_0329_0100_0002$$$::I'm left speechless.[lr]::
38397::$$$message_0329_0100_0003$$$::Caster too.[lr]::
38398::$$$message_0329_0100_0004$$$::The red knight leaps back into view and calls checkmate.::
38399::$$$message_0329_0101_0000$$$::He kneels on the ground and aims his bow towards the sky.[lr]::
38400::$$$message_0329_0101_0001$$$::His target is Caster.[lr]::
38401::$$$message_0329_0101_0002$$$::And the arrow he has nocked is the same magical blade that he shot at Berserker...!::
38402::$$$message_0329_0102_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"...I am the bone of my sword."[font italic=false][lr]::
38403::$$$message_0329_0102_0001$$$::Archer's voice shakes the air.[lr]::
38404::$$$message_0329_0102_0002$$$::"...[troya]...!"[lr]::
38405::$$$message_0329_0102_0003$$$::Caster weaves an urgent incantation.[lr]::
38406::$$$message_0329_0102_0004$$$::But having clearly anticipated that...::
38407::$$$message_0329_0103_0000$$$::"[font italic=true]Caladbolg![font italic=false]"::
38408::$$$message_0329_0104_0000$$$::Archer shoots the arrow.::
38409::$$$message_0329_0105_0000$$$::Is that his Noble Phantasm?[lr]::
38410::$$$message_0329_0105_0001$$$::The released arrow twists space itself.::
38411::$$$message_0329_0106_0000$$$::"Haah...!"[lr]::
38412::$$$message_0329_0106_0001$$$::Caster's moan fills the air.[lr]::
38413::$$$message_0329_0106_0002$$$::The tornado-like arrow easily penetrated Caster's defense.::
38414::$$$message_0329_0107_0000$$$::Most likely... Guessing from the distortion, I bet Caster would've been twisted along with space itself even if she had teleported.::
38415::$$$message_0329_0108_0000$$$::"Ah... Ah..."[lr]::
38416::$$$message_0329_0108_0001$$$::...Even then, Caster's still alive.[lr]::
38417::$$$message_0329_0108_0002$$$::The black robe has scattered, and the body underneath the robe has numerous cuts.[lr]::
38418::$$$message_0329_0108_0003$$$::Caster is using all her magical energy to regenerate, but I'm sure she would've died instantly without a chance to heal had it been a direct hit.::
38419::$$$message_0329_0109_0000$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
38420::$$$message_0329_0109_0001$$$::Archer's shot did not land a direct hit.[lr]::
38421::$$$message_0329_0109_0002$$$::The arrow was released into an empty space away from Caster, and her barrier of protection was destroyed from the aftermath.::
38422::$$$message_0329_0110_0000$$$::The arrow missed.[lr]::
38423::$$$message_0329_0110_0001$$$::...No, that's wrong.[lr]::
38424::$$$message_0329_0110_0002$$$::He did not miss. He deliberately did not hit her.[lr]::
38425::$$$message_0329_0110_0003$$$::I don't know what his intentions are.[lr]::
38426::$$$message_0329_0110_0004$$$::Though he had the chance to finish her off, for whatever reason, Archer let her go.::
38427::$$$message_0329_0111_0000$$$::...Stillness returns to the temple.[lr]::
38428::$$$message_0329_0111_0001$$$::Archer remains in front of me, while Caster floats down, glaring at Archer all the while.[lr]::
38429::$$$message_0329_0111_0002$$$::That last attack must've taken a lot out of him, as I can sense that Archer's magical energy is low.::
38430::$$$message_0329_0112_0000$$$::That goes for Caster as well.[lr]::
38431::$$$message_0329_0112_0001$$$::Although it missed, Archer's attack scraped away most of Caster's body and magical energy.[lr]::
38432::$$$message_0329_0112_0002$$$::Even if there was a big pool of magical energy here, it's useless if Caster is too injured to collect.::
38433::$$$message_0329_0113_0000$$$::"Khh... Ah..."[lr]::
38434::$$$message_0329_0113_0001$$$::Caster lands, dispirited.[lr]::
38435::$$$message_0329_0113_0002$$$::She seems to have managed to reform her body, but she's running on empty inside.[lr]::
38436::$$$message_0329_0113_0003$$$::It should be impossible to continue fighting.::
38437::$$$message_0329_0114_0000$$$::"Hnng... Ungh... Khh...!"[lr]::
38438::$$$message_0329_0114_0001$$$::Caster stares at us while breathing heavily.[lr]::
38439::$$$message_0329_0114_0002$$$::For some reason, she seems to be comparing the both of us.::
38440::$$$message_0329_0115_0000$$$::"...Archer. Why didn't you hit me with that shot?"[lr]::
38441::$$$message_0329_0115_0001$$$::The demoralization is in her voice as well.[lr]::
38442::$$$message_0329_0115_0002$$$::Archer shrugs as if to say it should be obvious.::
38443::$$$message_0329_0116_0000$$$::"Well, I said that I would only try once.[lr]::
38444::$$$message_0329_0116_0001$$$::My first attack didn't work. Everything else didn't really matter. What? Did you want me to break our promise and hit you instead?"[lr]::
38445::$$$message_0329_0116_0002$$$::He's crazy.::
38446::$$$message_0329_0117_0000$$$::"...So you had no intention of killing me?"[lr]::
38447::$$$message_0329_0117_0001$$$::"I just responded to your provocation. My objective was that guy over there. I didn't actually intend to start a fight, here."::
38448::$$$message_0329_0118_0000$$$::...Hm.[lr]::
38449::$$$message_0329_0118_0001$$$::He really didn't seem to come here with any hostility at first.::
38450::$$$message_0329_0119_0000$$$::"...I see. So you really did not come spoiling for a fight."[lr]::
38451::$$$message_0329_0119_0001$$$::"Yeah, I'm the same as that coward over there. It's my policy to avoid meaningless battles.[lr]::
38452::$$$message_0329_0119_0002$$$::I prefer to wield my sword at opportune moments, and most preferably when I can ensure a kill. Meaningless bloodshed isn't my thing."::
38453::$$$message_0329_0120_0000$$$::...I don't know what's so funny.[lr]::
38454::$$$message_0329_0120_0001$$$::But Caster gives a hearty laugh.::
38455::$$$message_0329_0121_0000$$$::"I see. So you two are similar then?"[lr]::
38456::$$$message_0329_0121_0001$$$::"What?"[lr]::
38457::$$$message_0329_0121_0002$$$::We reply in unison.[lr]::
38458::$$$message_0329_0121_0003$$$::Similar... Me and that guy?[lr]::
38459::$$$message_0329_0121_0004$$$::What makes her say that?::
38460::$$$message_0329_0122_0000$$$::"Am I wrong? You both do not like pointless killing, right? That boy over there cannot forgive Servants who feed on innocent humans like me.[lr]::
38461::$$$message_0329_0122_0001$$$::You do not like meaningless slaughter.[lr]::
38462::$$$message_0329_0122_0002$$$::See, it is exactly the same. Is that not why you two are cooperating?"::
38463::$$$message_0329_0123_0000$$$::"Stupi[line2]How do you figure that!? Get your eyes checked! How the hell could anyone think we're even remotely alike!?"::
38464::$$$message_0329_0124_0000$$$::"...I feel the same way. We may both prefer pacifism, but our principles are vastly different. My policy is to get rid of nuisances early on.[lr]::
38465::$$$message_0329_0124_0001$$$::I'm not a ponderous oaf like this guy."::
38466::$$$message_0329_0125_0000$$$::"Khh...! Pacifist my ass! I haven't forgotten. You shot at Saber along with Berserker.[lr]::
38467::$$$message_0329_0125_0001$$$::You made Saber fight by herself while you hid safely far away!"::
38468::$$$message_0329_0126_0000$$$::"It is what it is. We didn't have a truce then. Berserker's defeat was a far greater priority than Saber's safety.[lr]::
38469::$$$message_0329_0126_0001$$$::Or what? Don't tell me that you're telling me to save everything that I see. In that case, Berserker wouldn't be someone that you have to defeat, either."[lr]::
38470::$$$message_0329_0126_0002$$$::"Agh...!"::
38471::$$$message_0329_0127_0000$$$::We glare at each other.[lr]::
38472::$$$message_0329_0127_0001$$$::Man, I really don't get along with this guy![lr]::
38473::$$$message_0329_0127_0002$$$::Why does everything he says get on my nerves...!?::
38474::$$$message_0329_0128_0000$$$::"Heh..."[lr]::
38475::$$$message_0329_0128_0001$$$::Meanwhile...[lr]::
38476::$$$message_0329_0128_0002$$$::Caster's laugh is even more amused as she looks between us.::
38477::$$$message_0329_0129_0000$$$::"I like you two. Both your strength and the way you both are is a scarcity.[lr]::
38478::$$$message_0329_0129_0001$$$::It would be disappointing to make you two my enemies."[lr]::
38479::$$$message_0329_0129_0002$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
38480::$$$message_0329_0129_0003$$$::My head tilts in confusion.[lr]::
38481::$$$message_0329_0129_0004$$$::Archer looks away from me and glares at Caster.::
38482::$$$message_0329_0130_0000$$$::"...Hold on. What are you saying?"[lr]::
38483::$$$message_0329_0130_0001$$$::"Is it not obvious? I'm saying you should work with me.[lr]::
38484::$$$message_0329_0130_0002$$$::I can offer you both something better than your current partners.[lr]::
38485::$$$message_0329_0130_0003$$$::You, boy, I can give a Servant greater than Saber.[lr]::
38486::$$$message_0329_0130_0004$$$::And you, Archer, I can grant a contract with a mage superior to yours."::
38487::$$$message_0329_0131_0000$$$::   My mind grinds to a halt.[lr]::
38488::$$$message_0329_0131_0001$$$::I question her sanity and seriousness.::
38489::$$$message_0329_0132_0000$$$::"I should think it a tempting proposal. I have what it takes to end this war. I told you that it is easy for me to win.[lr]::
38490::$$$message_0329_0132_0001$$$::What do you think? If survival is the goal, it is a promising offer, no?"::
38491::$$$message_0329_0133_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
38492::$$$message_0329_0133_0001$$$::There's not even an option here.[lr]::
38493::$$$message_0329_0133_0002$$$::I decided to fight to stop those who involve innocent people.[lr]::
38494::$$$message_0329_0133_0003$$$::As such, I can't accept the offer of someone like her.::
38495::$$$message_0329_0134_0000$$$::"...I refuse. I can't cooperate with a witch like you."[lr]::
38496::$$$message_0329_0134_0001$$$::That's all there is to it.[lr]::
38497::$$$message_0329_0134_0002$$$::It should be obvious where I'd stand.[lr]::
38498::$$$message_0329_0134_0003$$$::I can't ally myself with this Servant, nor can I betray those I'm already partnered with.[lr]::
38499::$$$message_0329_0134_0004$$$::I'm going to fight alongside Saber and Archer would also never betray Tohsaka.::
38500::$$$message_0329_0135_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38501::$$$message_0329_0135_0001$$$::...Wait.[lr]::
38502::$$$message_0329_0135_0002$$$::This guy...he's hesitating.::
38503::$$$message_0329_0136_0000$$$::"...Hey. Archer, you...!"[lr]::
38504::$$$message_0329_0136_0001$$$::"...I refuse. I don't have a reason to take the power you offer.[lr]::
38505::$$$message_0329_0136_0002$$$::To start with, your territory is too weak. No matter how much stronger you make it, it will never be as strong as Berserker. The conditions aren't good enough to accept."::
38506::$$$message_0329_0137_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
38507::$$$message_0329_0137_0001$$$::...I sigh with relief.[lr]::
38508::$$$message_0329_0137_0002$$$::I had a bad feeling, but he's not like that.[lr]::
38509::$$$message_0329_0137_0003$$$::I hate him, but he's firm on his beliefs.::
38510::$$$message_0329_0138_0000$$$::"I see. So negotiations have failed, hmm?"[lr]::
38511::$$$message_0329_0138_0001$$$::"That is right. But I have no intention of fighting you here. It is by my own choice that I am here. It is not my Master's order, so I have no reason to cut you down. How about we call this a draw?"::
38512::$$$message_0329_0139_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
38513::$$$message_0329_0139_0001$$$::I doubt my own ears.[lr]::
38514::$$$message_0329_0139_0002$$$::Did he just say that he's going to let Caster go...?::
38515::$$$message_0329_0140_0000$$$::"...That is surprising. Your Master was after me, right? Yet, you are going to let me go?"[lr]::
38516::$$$message_0329_0140_0001$$$::"Yeah. I don't care how many people you kill here. That does not concern me."::
38517::$$$message_0329_0141_0000$$$::"...Oh my. What a terrible man. You think poison has its uses?"[lr]::
38518::$$$message_0329_0141_0001$$$::"My Master is not so enthusiastic about killing other Masters.[lr]::
38519::$$$message_0329_0141_0002$$$::So it will help me if you can do so. We can settle our match after that."::
38520::$$$message_0329_0142_0000$$$::"Khh... Hold on, Caster...!"::
38521::$$$message_0329_0143_0000$$$::Caster seems to have accepted Archer's proposal, as she turns around.[lr]::
38522::$$$message_0329_0143_0001$$$::I run to Caster as she moves to vanish.[lr]::
38523::$$$message_0329_0143_0002$$$::But Archer stops me.::
38524::$$$message_0329_0144_0000$$$::"Are you stupid? You're gonna get yourself killed that way."[lr]::
38525::$$$message_0329_0144_0001$$$::He says indifferently.[lr]::
38526::$$$message_0329_0144_0002$$$::Though true, his words make me feel so furious I make myself nauseous.::
38527::$$$message_0329_0145_0000$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
38528::$$$message_0329_0145_0001$$$::I stop.[lr]::
38529::$$$message_0329_0145_0002$$$::Caster's black gown flutters in the wind and disappears like magic. [nolr]::
