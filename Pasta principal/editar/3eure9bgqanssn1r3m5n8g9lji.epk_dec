75920::$$$message_0702_0000_0000$$$::But still...right now, I have to stop Illya!::
75921::$$$message_0702_0001_0000$$$::"No, come back, Illya!"[lr]::
75922::$$$message_0702_0001_0001$$$::I run out from the cover of the trees.[lr]::
75923::$$$message_0702_0001_0002$$$::Illya's running at Berserker.::
75924::$$$message_0702_0001_0003$$$:: I catch up to her and pull her back.[lr]::
75925::$$$message_0702_0001_0004$$$::...In my ears gone numb from stress, the fierce howling of the wind and the mad warrior's roars[lr]::
75926::$$$message_0702_0001_0005$$$::buffet me so violently I can't even see.::
75927::$$$message_0702_0002_0000$$$::The wind pushes me to the ground, Illya still in my arms.[lr]::
75928::$$$message_0702_0002_0001$$$::My vision's gone white, and I can't even stand.[lr]::
75929::$$$message_0702_0002_0002$$$::...No.[lr]::
75930::$$$message_0702_0002_0003$$$::I can't even remember to stand.::
75931::$$$message_0702_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75932::$$$message_0702_0003_0001$$$::...My body is hot.[lr]::
75933::$$$message_0702_0003_0002$$$::Something sleeping deep within Shirou Emiya cries out.[lr]::
75934::$$$message_0702_0003_0003$$$::I don't know what or why, but I sense this heat resonating with the Noble Phantasm that was just unleashed.::
75935::$$$message_0702_0004_0000$$$::"What..."::
75936::$$$message_0702_0005_0000$$$::It's getting as hard to breathe as it is to see.[lr]::
75937::$$$message_0702_0005_0001$$$::I can't do anything.[lr]::
75938::$$$message_0702_0005_0002$$$::As long as that sword is burned into my eyes, none of my human functions will be restored.::
75939::$$$message_0702_0006_0000$$$::"...This is insane."::
75940::$$$message_0702_0007_0000$$$::It's like I'm under a spell.[lr]::
75941::$$$message_0702_0007_0001$$$::My heart was stolen by something I only caught sight of for a brief instant.::
75942::$$$message_0702_0008_0000$$$::...Even among the numerous Noble Phantasms, it's an illusion of a different magnitude.[lr]::
75943::$$$message_0702_0008_0001$$$::Few Noble Phantasms can rival its elegant design and fine worksmanship.[lr]::
75944::$$$message_0702_0008_0002$$$::But its beauty is hardly skin deep.[lr]::
75945::$$$message_0702_0008_0003$$$::No, the word "beautiful" would be an insult to this sword.::
75946::$$$message_0702_0009_0000$$$::The sword isn't beautiful, but earnest and precious.[lr]::
75947::$$$message_0702_0009_0001$$$::It's a legend imbued with the hopes and dreams of the people.[lr]::
75948::$$$message_0702_0009_0002$$$::Neither a relic of myth nor a work of mankind, it is a crystallization crafted from our feelings alone[line2]a sword of pure fantasy, sitting at the apex.::
75949::$$$message_0702_0010_0000$$$::   My eyesight returns.[lr]::
75950::$$$message_0702_0010_0001$$$::Black, crimson flame as dark as midnight illuminates the sky.[lr]::
75951::$$$message_0702_0010_0002$$$::Was the pillar of light that cleaved the forest darkness itself?[lr]::
75952::$$$message_0702_0010_0003$$$::The flames burn silently, but the air is cold.[lr]::
75953::$$$message_0702_0010_0004$$$::Maybe it doesn't burn oxygen, but freezes it, instead.[lr]::
75954::$$$message_0702_0010_0005$$$::The darkly lit forest grows colder.::
75955::$$$message_0702_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75956::$$$message_0702_0011_0001$$$::A swordsman stands against the backdrop of black flames.[lr]::
75957::$$$message_0702_0011_0002$$$::I scowl at the sword pointed at me, one of my arms still around Illya.::
75958::$$$message_0702_0012_0000$$$::I can't feel any bloodlust or hostility from the swordsman.[lr]::
75959::$$$message_0702_0012_0001$$$::I'm afraid of being killed, but at the same time, I clench my jaw in frustration.::
75960::$$$message_0702_0013_0000$$$::[line3]It's not her.[lr]::
75961::$$$message_0702_0013_0001$$$::This is someone else.[lr]::
75962::$$$message_0702_0013_0002$$$::It's not just her lack of malice.[lr]::
75963::$$$message_0702_0013_0003$$$::She...[lr]::
75964::$$$message_0702_0013_0004$$$::She doesn't have any of the nobility she used to.::
75965::$$$message_0702_0014_0000$$$::Her helm cracks.[lr]::
75966::$$$message_0702_0014_0001$$$::It must have been thanks to Berserker's last attack.[lr]::
75967::$$$message_0702_0014_0002$$$::When I see her bare face, I know without a doubt that it's her, no matter how much she's changed.::
75968::$$$message_0702_0015_0000$$$::"Sa...ber..."[lr]::
75969::$$$message_0702_0015_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75970::$$$message_0702_0015_0002$$$::She doesn't reply.[lr]::
75971::$$$message_0702_0015_0003$$$::Her eyes are now gold and unreadable. They just stare down at me, her fallen foe.::
75972::$$$message_0702_0016_0000$$$::"...Shirou."[lr]::
75973::$$$message_0702_0016_0001$$$::Illya's voice is trembling.[lr]::
75974::$$$message_0702_0016_0002$$$::Behind Saber, something that looks like the eviscerated corpse of Berserker sinks into the dark Shadow.[lr]::
75975::$$$message_0702_0016_0003$$$::Illya just watched her Servant die in battle.[lr]::
75976::$$$message_0702_0016_0004$$$::Of course a young girl like her would be scared.::
75977::$$$message_0702_0017_0000$$$::"...Saber."[lr]::
75978::$$$message_0702_0017_0001$$$::I shake off the excess emotions.[lr]::
75979::$$$message_0702_0017_0002$$$::I hold on tight to Illya, and tense my right arm.::
75980::$$$message_0702_0018_0000$$$::    This isn't the time to be shocked.[lr]::
75981::$$$message_0702_0018_0001$$$::I'm going to save Illya.[lr]::
75982::$$$message_0702_0018_0002$$$::I'll save her and go home.[lr]::
75983::$$$message_0702_0018_0003$$$::I can't freeze in my tracks here and wait for death...!::
75984::$$$message_0702_0019_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
75985::$$$message_0702_0019_0001$$$::Saber swings her sword.[lr]::
75986::$$$message_0702_0019_0002$$$::Just as she's about to cut me down while I'm trying to stand up, she instantly changes direction and deflects three arrows.::
75987::$$$message_0702_0020_0000$$$::"Archer...!?"[lr]::
75988::$$$message_0702_0020_0001$$$::"Don't stop! Take Illya and get out of there!"[lr]::
75989::$$$message_0702_0020_0002$$$::Swords clash.[lr]::
75990::$$$message_0702_0020_0003$$$::Archer immediately follows his sniping up with a bladed assault.::
75991::$$$message_0702_0021_0000$$$::"Ngh...!"[lr]::
75992::$$$message_0702_0021_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
75993::$$$message_0702_0021_0002$$$::But it doesn't give me any peace of mind.[lr]::
75994::$$$message_0702_0021_0003$$$::Saber easily blocks his blindingly fast dual swords.::
75995::$$$message_0702_0022_0000$$$::"Gurgh...!"[lr]::
75996::$$$message_0702_0022_0001$$$::Something's wrong with Archer.[lr]::
75997::$$$message_0702_0022_0002$$$::I look and see that his feet are tangled in the Shadow, too.::
75998::$$$message_0702_0023_0000$$$::"What a disgrace, Archer.[lr]::
75999::$$$message_0702_0023_0001$$$::A pure Heroic Spirit could never resist that thing's cursed realm. Right now, you are little different from the wraiths roaming these woods."::
76000::$$$message_0702_0024_0000$$$::...That ruthless voice definitely belongs to Saber.[lr]::
76001::$$$message_0702_0024_0001$$$::She nonchalantly steps on the Shadow, and...[lr]::
76002::$$$message_0702_0024_0002$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
76003::$$$message_0702_0024_0003$$$::Effortlessly sends Archer flying into the woods behind him.::
76004::$$$message_0702_0025_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
76005::$$$message_0702_0025_0001$$$::Even if the Shadow was slowing him down, she cut right through both of his swords' guard without even trying.::
76006::$$$message_0702_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76007::$$$message_0702_0026_0001$$$::...Then, she does it again.[lr]::
76008::$$$message_0702_0026_0002$$$::Saber faces me silently.[lr]::
76009::$$$message_0702_0026_0003$$$::   Those eyes...[lr]::
76010::$$$message_0702_0026_0004$$$::They declare that she'll kill me unless I hand Illya over.::
76011::$$$message_0702_0027_0000$$$::"...Shirou."[lr]::
76012::$$$message_0702_0027_0001$$$::Illya lets go of my arm.[lr]::
76013::$$$message_0702_0027_0002$$$::The gesture seems to say that it's okay to hand her over. It flips a switch inside me.::
76014::$$$message_0702_0028_0000$$$::"Get back. Tohsaka's waiting for us in the woods. We'll figure this out if we can get back there."[lr]::
76015::$$$message_0702_0028_0001$$$::I push Illya back and take hold of my wooden sword with my now free left hand.::
76016::$$$message_0702_0029_0000$$$::...I take a seigan stance.[lr]::
76017::$$$message_0702_0029_0001$$$::If Saber comes for us, I'll use all the strength and magical energy I have to strike back.::
76018::$$$message_0702_0029_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76019::$$$message_0702_0029_0003$$$::That's all I can do now.[lr]::
76020::$$$message_0702_0029_0004$$$::I have nothing to say to Saber.[lr]::
76021::$$$message_0702_0029_0005$$$::I can't apologize, nor can I ask her to come back to me.[lr]::
76022::$$$message_0702_0029_0006$$$::She isn't speaking to me, so that isn't something I should say to her.::
76023::$$$message_0702_0029_0007$$$::   Saber is my enemy now.[lr]::
76024::$$$message_0702_0029_0008$$$::The only way I can respond is to fight back as hard as I can.::
76025::$$$message_0702_0029_0009$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
76026::$$$message_0702_0029_0010$$$::...I tighten my aim.[lr]::
76027::$$$message_0702_0029_0011$$$::I won't try for a mutual kill. Saber personally taught me that it isn't an effective tactic.[lr]::
76028::$$$message_0702_0029_0012$$$::An attack that risks your own life only works when you're evenly matched with your opponent.[lr]::
76029::$$$message_0702_0029_0013$$$::I can't hope to achieve that against Saber.::
76030::$$$message_0702_0029_0014$$$::So, I'm only going to try one attack.[lr]::
76031::$$$message_0702_0029_0015$$$::Now that her helmet is broken, I should be able to do some damage if I go for the head.[lr]::
76032::$$$message_0702_0029_0016$$$::It will take everything I have.[lr]::
76033::$$$message_0702_0029_0017$$$::I'll defeat my enemy and survive.[lr]::
76034::$$$message_0702_0029_0018$$$::Unless I imagine myself fully committing to this, I don't have a chance against her...!::
76035::$$$message_0702_0029_0019$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76036::$$$message_0702_0029_0020$$$::Here she comes...![lr]::
76037::$$$message_0702_0029_0021$$$::Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge...![lr]::
76038::$$$message_0702_0029_0022$$$::Who cares if it looks bad, who cares if I have to crawl in the mud, if I can't dodge the first attack, then forget protecting Illya...!::
76039::$$$message_0702_0030_0000$$$::"Oh."::
76040::$$$message_0702_0031_0000$$$::[line3]I'm dead.[lr]::
76041::$$$message_0702_0031_0001$$$::I've sparred rashly with Saber enough times to know that she won this bout.[lr]::
76042::$$$message_0702_0031_0002$$$::Her downstroke streaks down like a diving falcon, from my upper left.[lr]::
76043::$$$message_0702_0031_0003$$$::It's a slash precise enough to cut a grain of rice, coming for Shirou Emiya's head.::
76044::$$$message_0702_0032_0000$$$::But...[lr]::
76045::$$$message_0702_0032_0001$$$::My head stays attached.[lr]::
76046::$$$message_0702_0032_0002$$$::Saber's sword stops just shy of my neck.::
76047::$$$message_0702_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76048::$$$message_0702_0033_0001$$$::...What happened?[lr]::
76049::$$$message_0702_0033_0002$$$::Then, she wordlessly lowers her sword, and turns away.::
76050::$$$message_0702_0034_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
76051::$$$message_0702_0034_0001$$$::Don't tell me she stopped her sword because of [font italic=true]that[font italic=false].[lr]::
76052::$$$message_0702_0034_0002$$$::The black swamp spreading across the ground.[lr]::
76053::$$$message_0702_0034_0003$$$::That Shadow is trying to crawl out of it.::
76054::$$$message_0702_0035_0000$$$::...There's no doubt.[lr]::
76055::$$$message_0702_0035_0001$$$::It's that unknown being, that clump of curses[lr]::
76056::$$$message_0702_0035_0002$$$::that I saw before in the park...::
76057::$$$message_0702_0036_0000$$$::"My role is finished here. I leave the rest to you."[lr]::
76058::$$$message_0702_0036_0001$$$::"My gratitude. It is an easy task. With this, I can restore my honor for losing to that [font italic=true]Majnun[font italic=false]."[lr]::
76059::$$$message_0702_0036_0002$$$::Saber walks deeper into the black swamp.::
76060::$$$message_0702_0037_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
76061::$$$message_0702_0037_0001$$$::She sinks into the Shadow with a bubbling noise, just like Berserker.::
76062::$$$message_0702_0038_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76063::$$$message_0702_0038_0001$$$::I watch until she's gone.[lr]::
76064::$$$message_0702_0038_0002$$$::[line3]I have no way of knowing why she's still in this world, or why she's on their side now.[lr]::
76065::$$$message_0702_0038_0003$$$::If she's my enemy, then I have to fight her.[lr]::
76066::$$$message_0702_0038_0004$$$::That's what war is.::
76067::$$$message_0702_0039_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76068::$$$message_0702_0039_0001$$$::But, still...[lr]::
76069::$$$message_0702_0039_0002$$$::I can't help but think that if I had been stronger that night, she might never have been warped into that dark version of herself.::
76070::$$$message_0702_0040_0000$$$::"Emiya...!"[lr]::
76071::$$$message_0702_0040_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
76072::$$$message_0702_0040_0002$$$::Tohsaka's voice pulls me back to reality.[lr]::
76073::$$$message_0702_0040_0003$$$::   Right now, we're facing the creeping black Shadow and the Assassin with the skull mask locked into a smile.::
76074::$$$message_0702_0041_0000$$$::"We're running, Illya!"[lr]::
76075::$$$message_0702_0041_0001$$$::I take Illya's hand and run.[lr]::
76076::$$$message_0702_0041_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76077::$$$message_0702_0041_0003$$$::Illya gives the swamp that swallowed Berserker one last sad glance, and holds in her tears as she starts to run.::
