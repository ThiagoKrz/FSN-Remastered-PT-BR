59947::$$$message_0545_0000_0000$$$::"Here goes, Sakura. Rock, paper..."[lr]::
59948::$$$message_0545_0000_0001$$$::"Take that!"::
59949::$$$message_0545_0001_0000$$$::I thrust out my fist.[lr]::
59950::$$$message_0545_0001_0001$$$::Sakura meets it with an open palm.[lr]::
59951::$$$message_0545_0001_0002$$$::I played rock, while she played paper.::
59952::$$$message_0545_0002_0000$$$::"Oof."[lr]::
59953::$$$message_0545_0002_0001$$$::"Yay, I win!"[lr]::
59954::$$$message_0545_0002_0002$$$::I stare at my hand.[lr]::
59955::$$$message_0545_0002_0003$$$::...I did it again. Why do I always play rock on the first round of rock-paper-scissors?::
59956::$$$message_0545_0003_0000$$$::"So, I'll make dinner, while you can relax and watch TV."[lr]::
59957::$$$message_0545_0003_0001$$$::Sakura practically skips to the kitchen. Does cooking dinner by herself make her happy?::
59958::$$$message_0545_0004_0000$$$::"...Haah. Fine. We did promise that whoever wins would have to cook."[lr]::
59959::$$$message_0545_0004_0001$$$::I take off my apron and sit down.[lr]::
59960::$$$message_0545_0004_0002$$$::I don't know how it is in other households, but around here, making dinner is apparently a recreational pastime.::
59961::$$$message_0545_0005_0000$$$::...Not that I feel that way about it, but Sakura wanted to cook by herself.[lr]::
59962::$$$message_0545_0005_0001$$$::I appreciate the help, of course, but as her upperclassman, I shouldn't take advantage of her.[lr]::
59963::$$$message_0545_0005_0002$$$::Accordingly, on days like this when we both have free time, we come up with contests to decide who gets to make dinner.::
59964::$$$message_0545_0006_0000$$$::"...Nothing else to do. I'll have some tea."[lr]::
59965::$$$message_0545_0006_0001$$$::I make myself a cup of tea and absently sit down at the table.[lr]::
59966::$$$message_0545_0006_0002$$$::Saber's sleeping in my room, and Fuji-nee isn't coming over because of overtime at work, or whatever.[lr]::
59967::$$$message_0545_0006_0003$$$::Sakura and I are the only ones here, and Sakura's cheerfully standing in the kitchen.::
59968::$$$message_0545_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59969::$$$message_0545_0007_0001$$$::I unconsciously find myself watching her.[lr]::
59970::$$$message_0545_0007_0002$$$::She works at a brisk pace, looking like she's enjoying herself.::
59971::$$$message_0545_0008_0000$$$::I'm used to seeing her long hair and the dark red ribbon.[lr]::
59972::$$$message_0545_0008_0001$$$::The way she picks up utensils. The way that she firmly takes up the kitchen knife, even if it seems heavy, and sets a cabbage on the cutting board.::
59973::$$$message_0545_0009_0000$$$::"Hngh!"[lr]::
59974::$$$message_0545_0009_0001$$$::She cuts into it with vigor.[lr]::
59975::$$$message_0545_0009_0002$$$::Sakura always looks nervous when she first picks up a knife, but then her motions soon become familiar and efficient.::
59976::$$$message_0545_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59977::$$$message_0545_0010_0001$$$::I space out while watching her.[lr]::
59978::$$$message_0545_0010_0002$$$::The sun sets.[lr]::
59979::$$$message_0545_0010_0003$$$::When Sakura's here, life seems to go by slowly and peacefully.::
59980::$$$message_0545_0011_0000$$$::I suddenly realize how precious it is.[lr]::
59981::$$$message_0545_0011_0001$$$::...Once night falls, it's off to war again.[lr]::
59982::$$$message_0545_0011_0002$$$::I'm only just now beginning to appreciate how important this time is to me.::
59983::$$$message_0545_0012_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I gotta protect Sakura."[lr]::
59984::$$$message_0545_0012_0001$$$::I don't know what Zouken's scheming, but I won't let him lay a hand on her.[lr]::
59985::$$$message_0545_0012_0002$$$::I've had so many chances to interact with Sakura lately, and keep getting distracted by how she's changed, or should I say developed, physically.::
59986::$$$message_0545_0013_0000$$$::If I'm being honest, I think I'm starting to fall for her.[lr]::
59987::$$$message_0545_0013_0001$$$::No, that isn't quite true.[lr]::
59988::$$$message_0545_0013_0002$$$::I think I must have started to feel this way a while ago.::
59989::$$$message_0545_0014_0000$$$::I hear her gently humming in the kitchen.::
59990::$$$message_0545_0015_0000$$$::...It's really the little things like this that are important.[lr]::
59991::$$$message_0545_0015_0001$$$::As I daydream, I fill my third cup of tea, and watch the twilight scene.[lr]::
59992::$$$message_0545_0015_0002$$$::Time seems to pass in a leisurely, tender way, as if I'm getting drunk off the tea.::
