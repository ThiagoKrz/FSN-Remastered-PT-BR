20775::$$$message_0188_0000_0000$$$::    That is...[lr]::
20776::$$$message_0188_0000_0001$$$::The answer her Master arrived at.::
20777::$$$message_0188_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20778::$$$message_0188_0001_0001$$$::Her anger dissolves.[lr]::
20779::$$$message_0188_0001_0002$$$::All she can do is stare at her Master, her words dying on her lips.::
20780::$$$message_0188_0002_0000$$$::                             [font italic=true]"This path..."[font italic=false][lr]::
20781::$$$message_0188_0002_0001$$$::                             [font italic=true]"Everything about me...I don't believe it's wrong."[font italic=false]::
20782::$$$message_0188_0003_0000$$$::Despite his maimed body...[lr]::
20783::$$$message_0188_0003_0001$$$::As he struggles even to breathe...[lr]::
20784::$$$message_0188_0003_0002$$$::As he sheds the tears of one so horribly grieved...::
20785::$$$message_0188_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"I can't stray from this path, for all those who were left behind, who laid it."[font italic=false]::
20786::$$$message_0188_0005_0000$$$::Apologizing to those he must climb over, but unwavering in his chosen path.::
20787::$$$message_0188_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20788::$$$message_0188_0006_0001$$$::Her vision wavers.[lr]::
20789::$$$message_0188_0006_0002$$$::Her breath quivers.[lr]::
20790::$$$message_0188_0006_0003$$$::She knows his history.[lr]::
20791::$$$message_0188_0006_0004$$$::Just as he saw visions of her past, so she saw his.::
20792::$$$message_0188_0007_0000$$$::She was certain he would agree.[lr]::
20793::$$$message_0188_0007_0001$$$::No, she thought he [font italic=true]had[font italic=false] to.[lr]::
20794::$$$message_0188_0007_0002$$$::She'd meant to say, "It's not your fault," but the words died on her lips.[lr]::
20795::$$$message_0188_0007_0003$$$::If only he could hear it, she wanted to tell him he should not have to carry that weight.::
20796::$$$message_0188_0008_0000$$$::But he denies even that.[lr]::
20797::$$$message_0188_0008_0001$$$::No matter how tragic the past...[lr]::
20798::$$$message_0188_0008_0002$$$::...one cannot undo it.::
20799::$$$message_0188_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20800::$$$message_0188_0009_0001$$$::Her legs nearly give out beneath her.[lr]::
20801::$$$message_0188_0009_0002$$$::His words are a greater weight than even [font italic=true]she[font italic=false] can bear.[lr]::
20802::$$$message_0188_0009_0003$$$::To swear an oath and single-mindedly devote everything to carrying it out.[lr]::
20803::$$$message_0188_0009_0004$$$::She believed they were similar.[lr]::
20804::$$$message_0188_0009_0005$$$::How conceited.::
20805::$$$message_0188_0010_0000$$$::That was her great mistake.[lr]::
20806::$$$message_0188_0010_0001$$$::They were nothing alike.[lr]::
20807::$$$message_0188_0010_0002$$$::His resolve was so, so strong.[lr]::
20808::$$$message_0188_0010_0003$$$::And she, who could not even believe his words, was weak...::
20809::$$$message_0188_0011_0000$$$::"You would choose your own selfish wish over salvation."[lr]::
20810::$$$message_0188_0011_0001$$$::The priest releases the boy.[lr]::
20811::$$$message_0188_0011_0002$$$::He steps over the youth with a sneer, as if he's lost interest.::
20812::$$$message_0188_0012_0000$$$::"Then what say you, Saber?[lr]::
20813::$$$message_0188_0012_0001$$$::This boy says he does not need the Holy Grail. I am quite certain you disagree. Your goal must be to use the Grail to save the world in some capacity. A Heroic Spirit such as yourself is surely not so self-centered as that child."[lr]::
20814::$$$message_0188_0012_0002$$$::She feels her sense of reason is being imperiled.[lr]::
20815::$$$message_0188_0012_0003$$$::The priest says he will give her the Grail.[lr]::
20816::$$$message_0188_0012_0004$$$::He will give her what she desires. Her wish, granted.::
20817::$$$message_0188_0013_0000$$$::"Th-that..."[lr]::
20818::$$$message_0188_0013_0001$$$::She has no reason to refuse.[lr]::
20819::$$$message_0188_0013_0002$$$::That is the miracle she's been fighting for.[lr]::
20820::$$$message_0188_0013_0003$$$::It is the very reason she became a Servant.[lr]::
20821::$$$message_0188_0013_0004$$$::What Shirou said has no bearing on her own concerns.::
20822::$$$message_0188_0014_0000$$$::To obtain the Holy Grail, she, Saber, the hero of the sword[line2][lr]::
20823::$$$message_0188_0014_0001$$$::"I propose an exchange.[lr]::
20824::$$$message_0188_0014_0002$$$::Saber, kill your Master. With your own hands, you will have taken hold of your desire. I will give you the Holy Grail if you do this."[lr]::
20825::$$$message_0188_0014_0003$$$::[font italic=true]I decided I would do anything for it.[font italic=false]::
20826::$$$message_0188_0015_0000$$$::"What...?"[lr]::
20827::$$$message_0188_0015_0001$$$::His words blindside her.[lr]::
20828::$$$message_0188_0015_0002$$$::She doesn't even know what to think.[lr]::
20829::$$$message_0188_0015_0003$$$::The priests words, while easy to understand, are anathema to everything she believes in and stands for.::
20830::$$$message_0188_0016_0000$$$::"Hm? Why hesitate? You could kill him before he even realized what happened.[lr]::
20831::$$$message_0188_0016_0001$$$::He is clearly beyond saving. Would killing him now not be a mercy?"[lr]::
20832::$$$message_0188_0016_0002$$$::The priest steps aside.[lr]::
20833::$$$message_0188_0016_0003$$$::Before her stands a door leading to the crypt, and to her Master.::
20834::$$$message_0188_0017_0000$$$::"N......"[lr]::
20835::$$$message_0188_0017_0001$$$::She steps into the damp room, past the priest.[lr]::
20836::$$$message_0188_0017_0002$$$::She can't help herself.::
20837::$$$message_0188_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20838::$$$message_0188_0018_0001$$$::It's as if she's stepped into the depths of hell.[lr]::
20839::$$$message_0188_0018_0002$$$::He was made to suffer in this place, to witness his own darkness.::
20840::$$$message_0188_0018_0003$$$::But...he refused the salvation he was offered.[lr]::
20841::$$$message_0188_0018_0004$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20842::$$$message_0188_0018_0005$$$::She grips her sword.[lr]::
20843::$$$message_0188_0018_0006$$$::He lays at her feet, breathing raggedly.::
20844::$$$message_0188_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
20845::$$$message_0188_0019_0001$$$::It would be the end of a long, long journey.[lr]::
20846::$$$message_0188_0019_0002$$$::The Holy Grail she desires, in exchange for her life.[lr]::
20847::$$$message_0188_0019_0003$$$::All she must do is swing her sword but one final time.[lr]::
20848::$$$message_0188_0019_0004$$$::A Master and Servant are united only until they obtain the Grail.[lr]::
20849::$$$message_0188_0019_0005$$$::She could end it right here.::
