11960::$$$message_0118_0000_0000$$$::...Victory goes to the one who makes the first move. I need to fight.[lr]::
11961::$$$message_0118_0000_0001$$$::I can't hide, and I don't have time for that anyway![lr]::
11962::$$$message_0118_0000_0002$$$::I need to get back out there just as fast as I can and get back to Saber!::
11963::$$$message_0118_0001_0000$$$::   The door opens.[lr]::
11964::$$$message_0118_0001_0001$$$::I push myself up against the wall, right behind the door.::
11965::$$$message_0118_0002_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
11966::$$$message_0118_0002_0001$$$::The scout opens the door, but doesn't enter the room.[lr]::
11967::$$$message_0118_0002_0002$$$::...Hold on.[lr]::
11968::$$$message_0118_0002_0003$$$::The chair is visible from the entrance, even without coming in.[lr]::
11969::$$$message_0118_0002_0004$$$::Whoever is peeking in will know what's going on just from seeing the empty chair where I'm supposed to be sitting!::
11970::$$$message_0118_0003_0000$$$::"...Ah!"[lr]::
11971::$$$message_0118_0003_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Crap.[font italic=false][lr]::
11972::$$$message_0118_0003_0002$$$::If they call for backup right now, escaping will get a lot harder.[lr]::
11973::$$$message_0118_0003_0003$$$::I'm just going to have to hurry out and take on whoever's on patrol!::
11974::$$$message_0118_0004_0000$$$::I push off from the wall and rush toward the door.[lr]::
11975::$$$message_0118_0004_0001$$$::And then...[lr]::
11976::$$$message_0118_0004_0002$$$::They must have figured I was hiding, because they step into the room as soon as I jump out.::
11977::$$$message_0118_0005_0000$$$::"Kngh...take that!"[lr]::
11978::$$$message_0118_0005_0001$$$::No chance of stopping now.[lr]::
11979::$$$message_0118_0005_0002$$$::Whoever I'm up against, I just need to knock them out and escape.[lr]::
11980::$$$message_0118_0005_0003$$$::"Halt! If you comply, I may spare your...eh, Shirou!?"::
11981::$$$message_0118_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
11982::$$$message_0118_0006_0001$$$::I freeze.[lr]::
11983::$$$message_0118_0006_0002$$$::My mind goes blank.[lr]::
11984::$$$message_0118_0006_0003$$$::The very person I have to go save...is standing right in front of me.::
11985::$$$message_0118_0007_0000$$$::"S-Saber!? How? Why are you here!?"::
11986::$$$message_0118_0008_0000$$$::"Wh-why? I should hardly need to tell you. Servants need not explain their need to protect their Masters. It is my duty to come to your aid, knowing you have been captured."::
11987::$$$message_0118_0009_0000$$$::"Uh...well... But how did you know I got captured?[lr]::
11988::$$$message_0118_0009_0001$$$::Or, actually, why are you here, Saber?[lr]::
11989::$$$message_0118_0009_0002$$$::This is Illya's hideout. You shouldn't be coming anywhere near here right now."	„*8
