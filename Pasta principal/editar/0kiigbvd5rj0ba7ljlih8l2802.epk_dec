33724::$$$message_0272_0000_0000$$$::...I'll protect Saber.[lr]::
33725::$$$message_0272_0000_0001$$$::Even though she might not be able to defeat him, she should have an advantage if she focuses on retreat.[lr]::
33726::$$$message_0272_0000_0002$$$::There's about five meters between us.[lr]::
33727::$$$message_0272_0000_0003$$$::If Kuzuki takes another step, Tohsaka should be able to react and dodge any strike.::
33728::$$$message_0272_0001_0000$$$::But Saber is different.[lr]::
33729::$$$message_0272_0001_0001$$$::Her neck is half cut off like Rider and she's been thrown into a wall.[lr]::
33730::$$$message_0272_0001_0002$$$::Saber's situation is far more dire.[lr]::
33731::$$$message_0272_0001_0003$$$::Even if she's invincible against mages, she'll be easily defeated by Caster in that state...!::
33732::$$$message_0272_0002_0000$$$::"I'm counting on you, Tohsaka...!"[lr]::
33733::$$$message_0272_0002_0001$$$::I grip my sword and charge towards Kuzuki in front of me.::
33734::$$$message_0272_0003_0000$$$::My true objective is to reach Saber before she is attacked by Caster.[lr]::
33735::$$$message_0272_0003_0001$$$::I'll take a swing as I pass.[lr]::
33736::$$$message_0272_0003_0002$$$::I'm sure he'll dodge it, but Tohsaka should be able to take advantage of the opening...!::
33737::$$$message_0272_0004_0000$$$::I swing the sword as I pass by Kuzuki's side.::
33738::$$$message_0272_0005_0000$$$::"G-guh...!?"[lr]::
33739::$$$message_0272_0005_0001$$$::   It doesn't even do anything.[lr]::
33740::$$$message_0272_0005_0002$$$::The wooden sword crumbles to pieces, and the blow from his fist makes me lose my footing.[lr]::
33741::$$$message_0272_0005_0003$$$::He rushes in at Tohsaka in an instant.::
33742::$$$message_0272_0006_0000$$$::   Time stops.[lr]::
33743::$$$message_0272_0006_0001$$$::Tohsaka is astonished, but she immediately points her hand at Kuzuki.::
33744::$$$message_0272_0007_0000$$$::And the right hand of the enemy...[lr]::
33745::$$$message_0272_0007_0001$$$::The hand that wrecked Saber's neck strikes her in the chest.::
33746::$$$message_0272_0008_0000$$$::"Agh... Guh...!"[lr]::
33747::$$$message_0272_0008_0001$$$::All of the air in Tohsaka's lungs goes out.[lr]::
33748::$$$message_0272_0008_0002$$$::Then...[lr]::
33749::$$$message_0272_0008_0003$$$::A hammering blow, like a battering ram against a castle, strikes her face mercilessly.::
33750::$$$message_0272_0009_0000$$$::"Toh...saka..."[lr]::
33751::$$$message_0272_0009_0001$$$::...I witness my own fate as I see her miserable state.[lr]::
33752::$$$message_0272_0009_0002$$$::...Tohsaka's face isn't there.[lr]::
33753::$$$message_0272_0009_0003$$$::There's nothing left where Kuzuki's blow struck.::
33754::$$$message_0272_0010_0000$$$::"You made the wrong decision, Emiya, just like Caster."[lr]::
33755::$$$message_0272_0010_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
33756::$$$message_0272_0010_0002$$$::I can't raise my head.[lr]::
33757::$$$message_0272_0010_0003$$$::...Just like a student that doesn't know the answer and can't bear to face the teacher, I can't look at Kuzuki.[lr]::
33758::$$$message_0272_0010_0004$$$::I stand there, unable to walk.::
33759::$$$message_0272_0011_0000$$$::"...This is the second person I've killed..."[lr]::
33760::$$$message_0272_0011_0001$$$::A footstep.[lr]::
33761::$$$message_0272_0011_0002$$$::The murderer named Souichirou Kuzuki slowly walks towards me.[lr]::
33762::$$$message_0272_0011_0003$$$::"But, I still do not feel anything."[lr]::
33763::$$$message_0272_0011_0004$$$::With an unbelievable sound...[lr]::
33764::$$$message_0272_0011_0005$$$::He pierces through my chest.:?сс
