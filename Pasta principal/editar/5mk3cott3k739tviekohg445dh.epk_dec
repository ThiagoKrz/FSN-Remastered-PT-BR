74757::$$$message_0687_0000_0000$$$::It's 9:00 AM by the time we finish breakfast.[lr]::
74758::$$$message_0687_0000_0001$$$::We skip school.[lr]::
74759::$$$message_0687_0000_0002$$$::Now that things have gotten this serious, I don't feel like going to school until the Holy Grail War is over.::
74760::$$$message_0687_0001_0000$$$::One of the reasons I went to school was to fight together with Tohsaka.[lr]::
74761::$$$message_0687_0001_0001$$$::Now that our alliance is over, there's no point going out during the day. And most of all...[lr]::
74762::$$$message_0687_0001_0002$$$::It's too dangerous to let Sakura go outside.::
74763::$$$message_0687_0002_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
74764::$$$message_0687_0002_0001$$$::She's acting like she's in good health, but she could collapse at any time, like she did yesterday.[lr]::
74765::$$$message_0687_0002_0002$$$::Kotomine's treatment bought her time, but Sakura's walking on a tightrope.::
74766::$$$message_0687_0003_0000$$$::...I don't know what Zouken intends to do, but I can't let him get anywhere near Sakura, especially in her delicate state.[lr]::
74767::$$$message_0687_0003_0001$$$::There's nothing I can do if the Crest Worms inside her start moving again.::
74768::$$$message_0687_0004_0000$$$::Shinji used the drug,[lr]::
74769::$$$message_0687_0004_0001$$$::but Zouken was the one who implanted the Crest Worms, so he can probably activate them again just by looking at her.::
74770::$$$message_0687_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74771::$$$message_0687_0005_0001$$$::And, Kotomine did say...[lr]::
74772::$$$message_0687_0005_0002$$$::that Sakura doesn't have much time left.[lr]::
74773::$$$message_0687_0005_0003$$$::I'm the only one who knows that.[lr]::
74774::$$$message_0687_0005_0004$$$::...I can't even tell Sakura or Tohsaka.[lr]::
74775::$$$message_0687_0005_0005$$$::What I need to do now is end this war while Sakura doesn't know the truth.::
74776::$$$message_0687_0006_0000$$$::I don't have the power to save her.[lr]::
74777::$$$message_0687_0006_0001$$$::But it should be easy to save her with the omnipotent power of the Holy Grail.::
74778::$$$message_0687_0007_0000$$$::"Senpai? You've been making a strangely scary expression. We're taking a day off school, so I think you can rest..."::
74779::$$$message_0687_0008_0000$$$::"No, I'll rest once this war is over. Right now, I need to think about ways to win it."[lr]::
74780::$$$message_0687_0008_0001$$$::"...Do you still intend to fight, Senpai?"[lr]::
74781::$$$message_0687_0008_0002$$$::Her anxious tone is a little unexpected.::
74782::$$$message_0687_0009_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
74783::$$$message_0687_0009_0001$$$::...I've had a hunch for a while now that Sakura has no intent to fight.[lr]::
74784::$$$message_0687_0009_0002$$$::She should know that the Holy Grail is the only way to heal herself, but she doesn't even consider it as an option.::
74785::$$$message_0687_0010_0000$$$::...She has an aversion to fighting.[lr]::
74786::$$$message_0687_0010_0001$$$::Sakura is extremely afraid of hurting other people.[lr]::
74787::$$$message_0687_0010_0002$$$::That isn't wrong, and I don't intend to deny her feelings.[lr]::
74788::$$$message_0687_0010_0003$$$::Sakura can stay the way she is.[lr]::
74789::$$$message_0687_0010_0004$$$::I'm the one who's made her cry, and it's my role to fight.::
74790::$$$message_0687_0011_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I'll keep fighting. I'll try to resolve things peacefully when I can, but it won't always go that way. I don't imagine Zouken will let you go. I'm sorry, but I can't let him get the Holy Grail.[lr]::
74791::$$$message_0687_0011_0001$$$::...There are four Masters left. I'm going to make sure that you're the one who wins, and then we'll have you use the Holy Grail."::
74792::$$$message_0687_0012_0000$$$::"...I'm happy to hear that. But Senpai...can you fight Tohsaka-senpai?"[lr]::
74793::$$$message_0687_0012_0001$$$::"If she gets in the way, I will... Honestly, the Holy Grail is dangerous, and I'd rather leave it up to her. I'm sure she could handle it safely, and she'd probably help you."::
74794::$$$message_0687_0013_0000$$$::"...Do you think so? She's still a mage. She might not care for a weak person like me."::
74795::$$$message_0687_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
74796::$$$message_0687_0014_0001$$$::I can't fully deny that.[lr]::
74797::$$$message_0687_0014_0002$$$::...Tohsaka is a good person. I know that.[lr]::
74798::$$$message_0687_0014_0003$$$::But she's still a full-fledged mage.[lr]::
74799::$$$message_0687_0014_0004$$$::Last night, she said that she'd kill Sakura.[lr]::
74800::$$$message_0687_0014_0005$$$::Even if that's what the situation called for at the time, she still made her choice and was fully ready to carry it out.::
74801::$$$message_0687_0015_0000$$$::So...[lr]::
74802::$$$message_0687_0015_0001$$$::If it turns out that even the Holy Grail can't save Sakura, she'll have gained a weapon even more powerful than Archer that she can use to end Sakura's life.::
74803::$$$message_0687_0016_0000$$$::"...You're right. But I don't think she's capable of doing that.[lr]::
74804::$$$message_0687_0016_0001$$$::She can't kill you, Sakura."[lr]::
74805::$$$message_0687_0016_0002$$$::"Huh? What makes you think that?"::
74806::$$$message_0687_0017_0000$$$::"Well, I don't have any proof, but she's an amazing person at her core. I think she would choose a future that contains a ridiculously happy world where she doesn't have to lose anyone. So, it'll be okay.[lr]::
74807::$$$message_0687_0017_0001$$$::I'm sure that Tohsaka will help you, in the end."::
74808::$$$message_0687_0018_0000$$$::"Um, Senpai, do you and Tohsaka-senpai..."[lr]::
74809::$$$message_0687_0018_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
74810::$$$message_0687_0018_0002$$$::"...No, never mind. If that's what you think, then I'll trust you."::
74811::$$$message_0687_0019_0000$$$::"Okay. Though I'd feel a little pathetic if I left it up to her. I should be the one who protects you."[lr]::
74812::$$$message_0687_0019_0001$$$::I took Sakura's hand and made my choice. I can't let anyone else take my role.[lr]::
74813::$$$message_0687_0019_0002$$$::I'm going to do whatever I can to make Sakura happy.::
74814::$$$message_0687_0020_0000$$$::"Um, your feelings about it make me happy, but we can't say that you're in a state to fight anymore. Saber isn't here, and you're up against Tohsaka-senpai.[lr]::
74815::$$$message_0687_0020_0001$$$::You don't need to involve yourself with the Holy Grail anymore. So please, just come back to the normal life you had before.[lr]::
74816::$$$message_0687_0020_0002$$$::...I don't want you to get hurt because of me."::
74817::$$$message_0687_0021_0000$$$::"It was never your fault, silly. I'm doing this because I want to, and it's too late to back down now. You know that."::
74818::$$$message_0687_0022_0000$$$::I fought in the war as Saber's Master.[lr]::
74819::$$$message_0687_0022_0001$$$::I chose to become a Master of my own will, not just because I accidentally stumbled into the war.[lr]::
74820::$$$message_0687_0022_0002$$$::So I can't back down now.::
74821::$$$message_0687_0023_0000$$$::I'll fight, even if I'm alone.[lr]::
74822::$$$message_0687_0023_0001$$$::I'm going to see this through to the end.[lr]::
74823::$$$message_0687_0023_0002$$$::...It's the only way I can repay Saber for going along with my selfishness.::
74824::$$$message_0687_0024_0000$$$::"So, no matter what, you..."[lr]::
74825::$$$message_0687_0024_0001$$$::"I won't stop fighting. That's why we need to decide on our direction going forward. Is that all right with you, Rider?"[lr]::
74826::$$$message_0687_0024_0002$$$::"I do not mind. Your opinion is correct. What about you, Sakura?"::
74827::$$$message_0687_0025_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
74828::$$$message_0687_0025_0001$$$::Sakura silently agrees.[lr]::
74829::$$$message_0687_0025_0002$$$::...Good. She seems to have accepted the logic of it.::
74830::$$$message_0687_0026_0000$$$::"All right. Before we start the meeting, though..."[lr]::
74831::$$$message_0687_0026_0001$$$::I look at Rider.[lr]::
74832::$$$message_0687_0026_0002$$$::...Since breakfast, I've gradually gotten used to Rider's presence in the living room, but there's still something I want to address.::
74833::$$$message_0687_0027_0000$$$::"What is it?"[lr]::
74834::$$$message_0687_0027_0001$$$::"Your eyes. Do you mind taking off your blindfold while you're at home?[lr]::
74835::$$$message_0687_0027_0002$$$::I know about your Mystic Eyes already, so you don't have to hide them."[lr]::
74836::$$$message_0687_0027_0003$$$::Isn't she uncomfortable keeping the blindfold on?::
74837::$$$message_0687_0028_0000$$$::"...You mean you find it visually unappealing?"[lr]::
74838::$$$message_0687_0028_0001$$$::"Yeah, to be blunt. Putting that aside, it has to be uncomfortable. It's a waste of your good looks, so why don't you get more comfortable?"[lr]::
74839::$$$message_0687_0028_0002$$$::"So he says, Master. I believe it's up to you, in that case."::
74840::$$$message_0687_0029_0000$$$::"No![lr]::
74841::$$$message_0687_0029_0001$$$::Absolutely noooot!"::
74842::$$$message_0687_0030_0000$$$::"Eh?"[lr]::
74843::$$$message_0687_0030_0001$$$::But...[lr]::
74844::$$$message_0687_0030_0002$$$::Why is Sakura so strongly against it?::
74845::$$$message_0687_0031_0000$$$::"Why not? Doesn't it bother you that she keeps the blindfold on?"::
74846::$$$message_0687_0032_0000$$$::"I-it doesn't bother me at all! Besides, Rider's eyes are Mystic Eyes. What if she hits you with her magecraft on impulse!?"[lr]::
74847::$$$message_0687_0032_0001$$$::"Huh. Would that happen, Rider?"::
74848::$$$message_0687_0033_0000$$$::"It would. My eyes are more like Wicked Eyes than Mystic Eyes.[lr]::
74849::$$$message_0687_0033_0001$$$::Even if I conserve my magical energy, it would be difficult to stop them from affecting you."[lr]::
74850::$$$message_0687_0033_0002$$$::"Damn. So you can't control your own eyes?"::
74851::$$$message_0687_0034_0000$$$::"I cannot. That is what they are known for.[lr]::
74852::$$$message_0687_0034_0001$$$::...However, you can expect them to have a lesser effect than they did yesterday. As you know, my Mystic Eyes have the power of Petrification. The cognitive erasure they cause when the target is taken by surprise is weakened, so your body should not petrify as quickly."::
74853::$$$message_0687_0035_0000$$$::"I see. So...I wouldn't get instantly paralyzed like I did yesterday?"[lr]::
74854::$$$message_0687_0035_0001$$$::"That depends on the situation. If you let your guard down, the Mystic Eyes would have an increased effect."::
74855::$$$message_0687_0036_0000$$$::"Hmm. Looks like I'd be safe as long as I don't mess up, so I think it should be okay. Even if I get caught in your Mystic Eyes, we're on the same side, so you can just set me free."::
74856::$$$message_0687_0037_0000$$$::"That is true. I will not kill you. In that sense, there is no danger to your life."[lr]::
74857::$$$message_0687_0037_0001$$$::"No! No means no! Rider's eyes do more than just petrify people!"::
74858::$$$message_0687_0038_0000$$$::"This is also true. So, let us keep the seal on."[lr]::
74859::$$$message_0687_0038_0001$$$::Sakura pats her chest in relief.::
74860::$$$message_0687_0039_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
74861::$$$message_0687_0039_0001$$$::Anyway...[lr]::
74862::$$$message_0687_0039_0002$$$::I'm not really sure what that was about, but Rider's going to leave her blindfold on.::
74863::$$$message_0687_0040_0000$$$::"Okay. I'm curious, but if that's what you prefer, then do that."[lr]::
74864::$$$message_0687_0040_0001$$$::"Yes. I do not like to bare my face. Let us avoid this topic in the future."::
74865::$$$message_0687_0041_0000$$$::Rider says it coldly, her earlier levity gone.[lr]::
74866::$$$message_0687_0041_0001$$$::...She really is hard to read.[lr]::
74867::$$$message_0687_0041_0002$$$::Maybe we're just not very compatible.::
S
