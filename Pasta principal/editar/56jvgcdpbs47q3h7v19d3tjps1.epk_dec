45788::$$$message_0407_0000_0000$$$::"We don't have much time. We'll beat Caster before Lancer and Archer settle their match."[lr]::
45789::$$$message_0407_0000_0001$$$::"I know. We shouldn't waste our breath.[lr]::
45790::$$$message_0407_0000_0002$$$::   So, are you sure I can leave Caster to you, Tohsaka?"::
45791::$$$message_0407_0001_0000$$$::"Yes. I'm sure I'll be thoroughly cornered, but don't help me. You can just try to keep Mr. Kuzuki away as long as possible."[lr]::
45792::$$$message_0407_0001_0001$$$::We go past the chapel and head to the door leading to the courtyard.::
45793::$$$message_0407_0002_0000$$$::I won't hesitate if Tohsaka says so.[lr]::
45794::$$$message_0407_0002_0001$$$::...Most of all, I don't know if I could back Tohsaka up even if she were in trouble.[lr]::
45795::$$$message_0407_0002_0002$$$::My opponent is Kuzuki. I wouldn't even be able to dodge his first attack if I'm paying attention to Tohsaka.::
45796::$$$message_0407_0003_0000$$$::   Caster's presence is getting closer.[lr]::
45797::$$$message_0407_0003_0001$$$::She must not even be hiding her powers, as the church is surrounded by Caster's magical energy.[lr]::
45798::$$$message_0407_0003_0002$$$::With this amount, she must already know about our raid.::
45799::$$$message_0407_0004_0000$$$::"Trace, on."[lr]::
45800::$$$message_0407_0004_0001$$$::I knit together the illusion as carefully as I can using the eight steps.[lr]::
45801::$$$message_0407_0004_0002$$$::I got used to it, as his swords are in both hands within a minute.::
45802::$$$message_0407_0005_0000$$$::"Ungh..."[lr]::
45803::$$$message_0407_0005_0001$$$::I feel a light headache.[lr]::
45804::$$$message_0407_0005_0002$$$::Even though I'm getting used to it, it takes some sort of toll on my body after all.[lr]::
45805::$$$message_0407_0005_0003$$$::Projection is certainly affecting my body without me realizing it.::
45806::$$$message_0407_0006_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
45807::$$$message_0407_0006_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
45808::$$$message_0407_0006_0002$$$::Is it my imagination?[lr]::
45809::$$$message_0407_0006_0003$$$::For a moment, I thought Tohsaka had hung her head in sorrow while running next to me.::
45810::$$$message_0407_0007_0000$$$::We go down through the darkness.[lr]::
45811::$$$message_0407_0007_0001$$$::We run down the stairs that go underground and go out to the open area.[lr]::
45812::$$$message_0407_0007_0002$$$::And after that, we jump off of the railing of the stairs down to the sanctuary like before.::
45813::$$$message_0407_0008_0000$$$::"Oh. You guys are like monkeys, jumping down like that.[lr]::
45814::$$$message_0407_0008_0001$$$::I don't know why you're in such a hurry, but at least use the stairs if you're human."::
45815::$$$message_0407_0009_0000$$$::We land in the sanctuary.[lr]::
45816::$$$message_0407_0009_0001$$$::This is supposed to be a surprise attack, but Caster greets us with composure.::
45817::$$$message_0407_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45818::$$$message_0407_0010_0001$$$::There is Souichirou Kuzuki standing beside Caster.[lr]::
45819::$$$message_0407_0010_0002$$$::...I feel no enmity or bloodlust from him.[lr]::
45820::$$$message_0407_0010_0003$$$::That is his battle posture. His clear murderous intent is even hiding the dreadfulness of that man.[lr]::
45821::$$$message_0407_0010_0004$$$::In that regard, he's even more like an assassin than the Servant Assassin right now.::
45822::$$$message_0407_0011_0000$$$::Saber is at the altar.[lr]::
45823::$$$message_0407_0011_0001$$$::The situation is the same as two days ago.[lr]::
45824::$$$message_0407_0011_0002$$$::Saber is still tied from the ceiling with her head hanging down.::
45825::$$$message_0407_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45826::$$$message_0407_0012_0001$$$::I'm relieved we made it, but at the same time, it worries me how awfully quiet she is.[lr]::
45827::$$$message_0407_0012_0002$$$::I feel like Saber was a bit more in pain before.[lr]::
45828::$$$message_0407_0012_0003$$$::She was shaking slightly, as if breathing with her whole body to go against Caster's magical energy.[lr]::
45829::$$$message_0407_0012_0004$$$::But she's silent now like she's frozen.::
45830::$$$message_0407_0013_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
45831::$$$message_0407_0013_0001$$$::I have a bad feeling.[lr]::
45832::$$$message_0407_0013_0002$$$::It's good Assassin is not here, but we won't be able to get out of here alive if my worries are true...::
45833::$$$message_0407_0014_0000$$$::"We're here, Caster. I thought things through, but I've decided to have you eliminated.[lr]::
45834::$$$message_0407_0014_0001$$$::You're an eyesore, you're in my way, you're troublesome, and I don't like the way you dress. You look like you came from the countryside with that purple robe in this day and age."::
45835::$$$message_0407_0015_0000$$$::Tohsaka insults Caster, who is full of composure, as if refusing to lose against her.[lr]::
45836::$$$message_0407_0015_0001$$$::Even though she's saying such things, she must actually be feeling the opposite from the way she's slowly closing in on her.::
45837::$$$message_0407_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45838::$$$message_0407_0016_0001$$$::...Now's not the time for me to be concerned about Saber either.[lr]::
45839::$$$message_0407_0016_0002$$$::If Tohsaka is going to close in on Caster counterclockwise, I'll close in clockwise.[lr]::
45840::$$$message_0407_0016_0003$$$::Caster and Kuzuki. If we're going to separate them, we have to attack them from both sides and isolate our enemies.::
45841::$$$message_0407_0017_0000$$$::"...Heh. You seem to be making a big misunderstanding as someone who was let go. Are all mages nowadays so reckless? No wonder Archer gave up on you."[lr]::
45842::$$$message_0407_0017_0001$$$::Tohsaka's insults must've worked on her, as Caster is glaring only at Tohsaka.::
45843::$$$message_0407_0018_0000$$$::I use that opening to move.[lr]::
45844::$$$message_0407_0018_0001$$$::I move to the other side of Tohsaka, where I can attack Caster from the other side.[lr]::
45845::$$$message_0407_0018_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45846::$$$message_0407_0018_0003$$$::Kuzuki watches that in silence.::
45847::$$$message_0407_0019_0000$$$::...I knew it.[lr]::
45848::$$$message_0407_0019_0001$$$::There's no way that man won't notice something like this.[lr]::
45849::$$$message_0407_0019_0002$$$::He's aware of everything.[lr]::
45850::$$$message_0407_0019_0003$$$::The fact that we're trying to defeat them one by one, and the fact that Tohsaka has some kind of plan.::
45851::$$$message_0407_0020_0000$$$::Even with that in mind, Kuzuki is letting Caster do as she wishes.[lr]::
45852::$$$message_0407_0020_0001$$$::...It's not like Kuzuki is being manipulated by Caster.[lr]::
45853::$$$message_0407_0020_0002$$$::He became Caster's Master of his own free will.[lr]::
45854::$$$message_0407_0020_0003$$$::But, still... Based on his passivity, Kuzuki is close to a puppet.::
45855::$$$message_0407_0021_0000$$$::A Servant who is skilled in providing backup using magecraft,[lr]::
45856::$$$message_0407_0021_0001$$$::and a Master who is skilled in hand-to-hand combat.[lr]::
45857::$$$message_0407_0021_0002$$$::Their roles are reversed, and I feel like their way of being is reversed as well.[lr]::
45858::$$$message_0407_0021_0003$$$::Caster who persistently seeks the Holy Grail, and the Master protects Caster without his own will.::
45859::$$$message_0407_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45860::$$$message_0407_0022_0001$$$::That makes me think without a reason.[lr]::
45861::$$$message_0407_0022_0002$$$::That if Caster was a Master and Kuzuki was just a Servant who protected her, then they wouldn't have fallen so low.::
45862::$$$message_0407_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45863::$$$message_0407_0023_0001$$$::Tohsaka looks over at me.[lr]::
45864::$$$message_0407_0023_0002$$$::It means our positions are perfect.[lr]::
45865::$$$message_0407_0023_0003$$$::Then... The match will be settled if either of us attacks.[lr]::
45866::$$$message_0407_0023_0004$$$::Whether Tohsaka and I get defeated or Tohsaka defeats Caster before that, our battle with Caster will end here.::
45867::$$$message_0407_0024_0000$$$::"Let us start then. This is the third time I'm fighting you. I'll settle this for the last time."[lr]::
45868::$$$message_0407_0024_0001$$$::Tohsaka steps in closer to Caster.::
45869::$$$message_0407_0025_0000$$$::"You're talking big. I doubt it, but do you seriously think you can win against me, young lady?[lr]::
45870::$$$message_0407_0025_0001$$$::In that case, we don't even need to fight. I shall let you go again this time, so that you can go fix that personality of yours."::
45871::$$$message_0407_0026_0000$$$::"Of course I can win.[lr]::
45872::$$$message_0407_0026_0001$$$::Isn't that right? There's no way a first-class mage can lose to a third-class mage like you."::
45873::$$$message_0407_0027_0000$$$::"..Is that so? Then I suppose it can't be helped.[lr]::
45874::$$$message_0407_0027_0001$$$::It seems that I need to discipline that arrogant mouth of yours, young lady."::
45875::$$$message_0407_0028_0000$$$::They brace themselves at the same time.[lr]::
45876::$$$message_0407_0028_0001$$$::With a few meters between them, they look like mirror images.::
45877::$$$message_0407_0029_0000$$$::That is the signal.[lr]::
45878::$$$message_0407_0029_0001$$$::I attack the defenseless Caster...[lr]::
45879::$$$message_0407_0029_0002$$$::"...!"[lr]::
45880::$$$message_0407_0029_0003$$$::And of course, I'm blocked by Kuzuki's blow.::
45881::$$$message_0407_0030_0000$$$::...The ghost-like assassin is in front of me.[lr]::
45882::$$$message_0407_0030_0001$$$::I don't have the composure to watch over Tohsaka and Caster's fight.[lr]::
45883::$$$message_0407_0030_0002$$$::He already knows my intentions.[lr]::
45884::$$$message_0407_0030_0003$$$::He will not let me buy time.[lr]::
45885::$$$message_0407_0030_0004$$$::Letting out the snake that cornered even Saber, Souichirou Kuzuki comes to take my life.::
45886::$$$message_0407_0031_0000$$$::    I can hold him off for one minute at most.[lr]::
45887::$$$message_0407_0031_0001$$$::That should be the same for Tohsaka.[lr]::
45888::$$$message_0407_0031_0002$$$::Originally, this was a battle with no chance of victory had the roles not been reversed.[lr]::
45889::$$$message_0407_0031_0003$$$::There is no way we could win against enemies who surpass us in both hand-to-hand combat and magecraft.::
45890::$$$message_0407_0032_0000$$$::   But looking at it the other way, we can at least put up a fight.[lr]::
45891::$$$message_0407_0032_0001$$$::Tohsaka would be killed in an instant if she fought Kuzuki,[lr]::
45892::$$$message_0407_0032_0002$$$::and Caster would end me just by pointing at me if I fought her.[lr]::
45893::$$$message_0407_0032_0003$$$::On the other hand, we might not be able to win, but at least we won't get killed in an instant.::
45894::$$$message_0407_0033_0000$$$::...In other words...[lr]::
45895::$$$message_0407_0033_0001$$$::This battle is not about how we can defeat them, but...[lr]::
45896::$$$message_0407_0033_0002$$$::A battle like walking on a tightrope to see how long we can hold off an opponent who is superior to us.::|i
