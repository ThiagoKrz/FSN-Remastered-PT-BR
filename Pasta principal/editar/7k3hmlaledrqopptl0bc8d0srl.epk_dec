34857::$$$message_0284_0000_0000$$$::I'll go help Sakura out.[lr]::
34858::$$$message_0284_0000_0001$$$::She's making breakfast for four people, so it'll take longer. I also want to ask her about last night.[lr]::
34859::$$$message_0284_0000_0002$$$::It seems like Saber went with my story, but it's entirely possible they didn't get along and I want to make sure everything's all right.::
34860::$$$message_0284_0001_0000$$$::"Good morning, Senpai. I've already started preparing breakfast."[lr]::
34861::$$$message_0284_0001_0001$$$::"Ah, morning, Sakura. Let me help you with that."[lr]::
34862::$$$message_0284_0001_0002$$$::I put on an apron and make my way into the kitchen.::
34863::$$$message_0284_0002_0000$$$::"Oh, then please do the grilling. Hmm, I just cooked the rice, so I'll make the miso soup and the side dish." ::
34864::$$$message_0284_0003_0000$$$::As always, Sakura is quick and efficient.[lr]::
34865::$$$message_0284_0003_0001$$$::She doesn't seem to be putting on a front, so it doesn't look like yesterday is particularly bothering her, but...::
34866::$$$message_0284_0004_0000$$$::"Sakura. Um, about yesterday..."[lr]::
34867::$$$message_0284_0004_0001$$$::"Yes? What do you mean, Senpai?"::
34868::$$$message_0284_0005_0000$$$::"Well, yesterday, the three of you had to share a room, right? You seemed to be worried about having Saber stay, so I was wondering how it went."::
34869::$$$message_0284_0006_0000$$$::"I don't know what you mean when you say it like that. Please just ask me clearly what it is you want to know or I can't answer."::
34870::$$$message_0284_0007_0000$$$::"Uh... S-so, it'd be nice if you all got along..."[lr]::
34871::$$$message_0284_0007_0001$$$::"Oh. Would it make you happy if Saber and I got along?"::
34872::$$$message_0284_0008_0000$$$::"...Well, it would help me out. I decided on Saber's stay without your permission, right? It'd be reasonable for you to resent her at the very least for that.[lr]::
34873::$$$message_0284_0008_0001$$$::But, if you can overlook that and be nice to Saber, um..."[lr]::
34874::$$$message_0284_0008_0002$$$::"Then I'd make you happy?"::
34875::$$$message_0284_0009_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
34876::$$$message_0284_0009_0001$$$::It's embarrassing to say it out loud, so I just nod.::
34877::$$$message_0284_0010_0000$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
34878::$$$message_0284_0010_0001$$$::I'd be thankful if she overlooked this and got along with Saber.[lr]::
34879::$$$message_0284_0010_0002$$$::Since Sakura's like family, I don't want her upset over something that I did without her input. ::
34880::$$$message_0284_0011_0000$$$::"Then, to answer your question...[lr]::
34881::$$$message_0284_0011_0001$$$::By midnight last night we managed to work it out.[lr]::
34882::$$$message_0284_0011_0002$$$::I still find her a bit hard to deal with, but I think we can get along. She is difficult to understand, but she does have a cute side, I suppose."::
34883::$$$message_0284_0012_0000$$$::Sakura's smile is genuine and heartfelt.[lr]::
34884::$$$message_0284_0012_0001$$$::That makes me really happy.[lr]::
34885::$$$message_0284_0012_0002$$$::It truly does, but...::
34886::$$$message_0284_0013_0000$$$::"Cute... You mean, Saber!?"[lr]::
34887::$$$message_0284_0013_0001$$$::"That is how I see it. Ms. Fujimura already treats her like she's known her for ages and Saber seems to have taken to it easily enough.[lr]::
34888::$$$message_0284_0013_0002$$$::We were actually sharing a room to keep an eye on her, but starting tonight we are going to room together because we want to."::
34889::$$$message_0284_0014_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
34890::$$$message_0284_0014_0001$$$::T-that is an unexpected turn of events.[lr]::
34891::$$$message_0284_0014_0002$$$::But Saber's cute side, huh... She certainly is rather beautiful, but "cute" doesn't seem quite right...::
