38968::$$$message_0333_0001_0000$$$::There were people I couldn't save,[lr]::
38969::$$$message_0333_0001_0001$$$::and there was me, who could not save them.[lr]::
38970::$$$message_0333_0001_0002$$$::That must be the reason.[lr]::
38971::$$$message_0333_0001_0003$$$::What happened after that, and what did I want to become?::
38972::$$$message_0333_0002_0000$$$::...I remember the gray sky.[lr]::
38973::$$$message_0333_0002_0001$$$::A dark sky on the verge of crying.[lr]::
38974::$$$message_0333_0002_0002$$$::Then, my will to live almost fades away.[lr]::
38975::$$$message_0333_0002_0003$$$::One only dies when their will is gone.[lr]::
38976::$$$message_0333_0002_0004$$$::I walk, leaving behind many people, and survive a few minutes longer than everyone else.::
38977::$$$message_0333_0003_0000$$$::During that process, many things died.[lr]::
38978::$$$message_0333_0003_0001$$$::That's why I was almost empty.[lr]::
38979::$$$message_0333_0003_0002$$$::If the will to live breaks, then there is nothing.[lr]::
38980::$$$message_0333_0003_0003$$$::If there is nothing, the only thing left is to die.::
38981::$$$message_0333_0004_0000$$$::And I died.[lr]::
38982::$$$message_0333_0004_0001$$$::Even thinking became difficult, so I closed my eyes... Right before everything turned completely black, my hand that was extended to the sky was grabbed.::
38983::$$$message_0333_0005_0000$$$::    That was everything.[lr]::
38984::$$$message_0333_0005_0001$$$::I have nothing left.[lr]::
38985::$$$message_0333_0005_0002$$$::Since I didn't have anything, that's all I had.[lr]::
38986::$$$message_0333_0005_0003$$$::I couldn't do it myself, so I admired it severely.::
38987::$$$message_0333_0006_0000$$$::...That's right.[lr]::
38988::$$$message_0333_0006_0001$$$::I wanted to be of help to many people in place of those I could not save.[lr]::
38989::$$$message_0333_0006_0002$$$::   Yet...[lr]::
38990::$$$message_0333_0006_0003$$$::He said that it was all false.::
38991::$$$message_0333_0007_0000$$$::A borrowed ideal.[lr]::
38992::$$$message_0333_0007_0001$$$::A salvation passed around like a gold coin.[lr]::
38993::$$$message_0333_0007_0002$$$::An ending without reward.::
38994::$$$message_0333_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
38995::$$$message_0333_0009_0000$$$::What did I want to become, and for what?::
38996::$$$message_0333_0010_0000$$$::                               "I wanted to become a hero of justice."::
38997::$$$message_0333_0011_0000$$$::It's not me that said that, but...::
38998::$$$message_0333_0012_0000$$$::"...Oh."[lr]::
38999::$$$message_0333_0012_0001$$$::I wake up.[lr]::
39000::$$$message_0333_0012_0002$$$::The sunlight is bright, telling me that it's a sunny day, unlike yesterday.::
39001::$$$message_0333_0013_0000$$$::"...Damn it. But I still have a headache."[lr]::
39002::$$$message_0333_0013_0001$$$::I don't know if it's because of what happened last night, but I didn't wake up feeling good.[lr]::
39003::$$$message_0333_0013_0002$$$::I must've had a bad nightmare, as my temple is throbbing.[lr]::
39004::$$$message_0333_0013_0003$$$::"Ugh... I'm gonna go wash my face."::
39005::$$$message_0333_0014_0000$$$::"Wow, it's really sunny."[lr]::
39006::$$$message_0333_0014_0001$$$::It's only 6:30 AM, but the sky is enchantingly blue.[lr]::
39007::$$$message_0333_0014_0002$$$::It's also warm for a winter morning, and the snow in the yard is all gone.::
39008::$$$message_0333_0015_0000$$$::My sleepiness goes away once I wash my face and brush my teeth.[lr]::
39009::$$$message_0333_0015_0001$$$::"Oh yeah. It's Sunday, so I don't have to go wake Fuji-nee up."[lr]::
39010::$$$message_0333_0015_0002$$$::I can prepare breakfast later than usual and we can take our time to eat.::
39011::$$$message_0333_0016_0000$$$::There's no one in the living room.[lr]::
39012::$$$message_0333_0016_0001$$$::"...So I'm the first one up, huh? I can understand Fuji-nee and Saber, but I'm surprised Tohsaka is still sleeping."::
39013::$$$message_0333_0017_0000$$$::Well anyway, I need to prepare breakfast.[lr]::
39014::$$$message_0333_0017_0001$$$::Even though it's the weekend, there are four people this morning.[lr]::
39015::$$$message_0333_0017_0002$$$::I should start the groundwork...::
39016::$$$message_0333_0018_0000$$$::"Huh? There's no bread."[lr]::
39017::$$$message_0333_0018_0001$$$::I bought a loaf yesterday, but the whole bag is missing.::
39018::$$$message_0333_0019_0000$$$::"Should I take it as sincerity that there are three one-hundred yen coins in its place?"[lr]::
39019::$$$message_0333_0019_0001$$$::...I've never encountered such a crime.[lr]::
39020::$$$message_0333_0019_0002$$$::The first suspect, Fuji-nee, wouldn't do such an elaborate thing.[lr]::
39021::$$$message_0333_0019_0003$$$::Then there's only one culprit...::
39022::$$$message_0333_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]Well, what should I do?[font italic=false][lr]::
39023::$$$message_0333_0020_0001$$$::I don't really care about the bread, but we have an extra mouth named Tohsaka to feed this morning.[lr]::
39024::$$$message_0333_0020_0002$$$::"...It's before 7 AM. I bet the tofu shop is open."[lr]::
