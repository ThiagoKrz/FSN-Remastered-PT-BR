65721::$$$message_0606_0000_0000$$$::[line3]I can't do it.[lr]::
65722::$$$message_0606_0000_0001$$$::The pain from last night springs to mind.[lr]::
65723::$$$message_0606_0000_0002$$$::I was terrified by the indescribable agony and unavoidable death.[lr]::
65724::$$$message_0606_0000_0003$$$::But, more than that...[lr]::
65725::$$$message_0606_0000_0004$$$::I'm afraid of what I'll do once I set this arm free.::
65726::$$$message_0606_0001_0000$$$::"...No, Tohsaka. I can't take this cloth off. There will be no going back if I do."[lr]::
65727::$$$message_0606_0001_0001$$$::I give her a firm answer, fighting down the terror.[lr]::
65728::$$$message_0606_0001_0002$$$::And...::
65729::$$$message_0606_0002_0000$$$::"Well done. Yeah, it would be a big problem if you were willing to take it off so easily."[lr]::
65730::$$$message_0606_0002_0001$$$::Tohsaka seems very happy, even though I said no.::
65731::$$$message_0606_0003_0000$$$::"...? But I said no, Tohsaka."[lr]::
65732::$$$message_0606_0003_0001$$$::"I know. Sorry, but that was just a test.[lr]::
65733::$$$message_0606_0003_0002$$$::You have a dangerous habit of taking risks, so I wanted to drive the nail home. If you had said yes, I would've tied up your hands and feet."::
65734::$$$message_0606_0004_0000$$$::"A test... you were testing me, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
65735::$$$message_0606_0004_0001$$$::"Ah... Yeah, I wanted to know how you feel, Shirou.[lr]::
65736::$$$message_0606_0004_0002$$$::Look, I said earlier that I'd never make you use Archer's arm. Meaning that I wouldn't make you take off the shroud.::
65737::$$$message_0606_0005_0000$$$::I know how this sounds right after I was trying to test you, but never say that you're going to take off the shroud again. Once you do, there's no going back."::@“
