56752::$$$message_0500_0000_0000$$$::"I'm not prepared to kill her. I came back here for Sakura.[lr]::
56753::$$$message_0500_0000_0001$$$::"Ngh..."::
56754::$$$message_0500_0001_0000$$$::"...Fine. I know where you stand.[lr]::
56755::$$$message_0500_0001_0001$$$::You're saying you'll protect one person[line2]Sakura[line2]over everyone else."[lr]::
56756::$$$message_0500_0001_0002$$$::"Yeah. I won't let you tell me that it's wrong. If you're going to hurt her, then I'll stop you here."::
56757::$$$message_0500_0002_0000$$$::"You'll stop me? No way. You can't even move a step, let alone try and stop me. No matter how much you want to protect Sakura, I won't let you go against my plan."::
56758::$$$message_0500_0003_0000$$$::Tohsaka's voice is emotionless.[lr]::
56759::$$$message_0500_0003_0001$$$::Then, I realize...[lr]::
56760::$$$message_0500_0003_0002$$$::"Wh...at...?"[lr]::
56761::$$$message_0500_0003_0003$$$::I can't even move a finger, let alone my limbs.::
56762::$$$message_0500_0004_0000$$$::"Gurgh...!? Tohsaka, you...!"[lr]::
56763::$$$message_0500_0004_0001$$$::"You said you wouldn't let me tell you that you're wrong. But you made a mistake. If you wanted to go your own way, you never should have given up your right to decide."::
56764::$$$message_0500_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56765::$$$message_0500_0005_0001$$$::I feel my heart expand.[lr]::
56766::$$$message_0500_0005_0002$$$::No, it's not my heart, but an oath binding it.::
56767::$$$message_0500_0006_0000$$$::...Also,[lr]::
56768::$$$message_0500_0006_0001$$$::for me, that was an ideal answer.[lr]::
56769::$$$message_0500_0006_0002$$$::It's a little lacking, but this is all I need to do if that's your answer.::
56770::$$$message_0500_0007_0000$$$::"A curse...of compulsion."::
56771::$$$message_0500_0008_0000$$$::"Yeah. I only meant it as a joke, so I never thought it would come in handy. Once you swore absolute obedience to me, you lost the ability to defy my opinion.[lr]::
56772::$$$message_0500_0008_0001$$$::Back there, you made a contract with me, not a promise. That means you're my servant, not my collaborator."::
56773::$$$message_0500_0009_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
56774::$$$message_0500_0009_0001$$$::"I'm going to kill Sakura. But don't get the wrong idea, Emiya. You wouldn't be able to stop me even if you didn't have this Geass on you.[lr]::
56775::$$$message_0500_0009_0002$$$::This is my responsibility. It isn't your fault."::
56776::$$$message_0500_0010_0000$$$::"Rrgh! Tohsaka, wai..."[lr]::
56777::$$$message_0500_0010_0001$$$::I can't even finish my sentence anymore.::
56778::$$$message_0500_0011_0000$$$::Tohsaka's gone.[lr]::
56779::$$$message_0500_0011_0001$$$::"No...why..."[lr]::
56780::$$$message_0500_0011_0002$$$::I can't move my body.::
56781::$$$message_0500_0012_0000$$$::"Damn it! Are you kidding me!?"[lr]::
56782::$$$message_0500_0012_0001$$$::I desperately try to move.[lr]::
56783::$$$message_0500_0012_0002$$$::I need to get free.[lr]::
56784::$$$message_0500_0012_0003$$$::I struggle to move as soon as I can, when suddenly,[lr]::
56785::$$$message_0500_0012_0004$$$::my paralyzed body suddenly obeys me again.::
56786::$$$message_0500_0013_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
56787::$$$message_0500_0013_0001$$$::My legs won't move to give chase.[lr]::
56788::$$$message_0500_0013_0002$$$::I'm free, but my mind feels frozen.[lr]::
56789::$$$message_0500_0013_0003$$$::   Suddenly, I understand.[lr]::
56790::$$$message_0500_0013_0004$$$::I won't be able to move my body as long as I go against Tohsaka's will.[lr]::
56791::$$$message_0500_0013_0005$$$::Then...[lr]::
56792::$$$message_0500_0013_0006$$$::If I can move freely again, that must mean my reason for opposing her is gone.::
56793::$$$message_0500_0014_0000$$$::"Sakura..."[lr]::
56794::$$$message_0500_0014_0001$$$::I drop to my knees.[lr]::
56795::$$$message_0500_0014_0002$$$::With nowhere left to go, my heart breaks.::
56796::$$$message_0500_0015_0000$$$::Light leaves my vision, and the church is covered in darkness.[lr]::
56797::$$$message_0500_0015_0001$$$::   Shirou Emiya is in zero gravity.[lr]::
56798::$$$message_0500_0015_0002$$$::I swore that I'd abandon my past ideals to protect Sakura.[lr]::
56799::$$$message_0500_0015_0003$$$::That was my new, unyielding guidepost.[lr]::
56800::$$$message_0500_0015_0004$$$::And then, I lost it so quickly.::
56801::$$$message_0500_0016_0000$$$::   The war will go on.[lr]::
56802::$$$message_0500_0016_0001$$$::The Holy Grail War will continue, and I'll probably fight alongside Tohsaka, who murdered Sakura, to end the conflict.::
56803::$$$message_0500_0017_0000$$$::...But that will happen in a place that doesn't matter anymore.[lr]::
56804::$$$message_0500_0017_0001$$$::Shirou Emiya has lost his place forever.[lr]::
56805::$$$message_0500_0017_0002$$$::I'll keep going, without anything to guide me, not knowing what I should do...::
