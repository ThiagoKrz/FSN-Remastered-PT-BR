73652::$$$message_0678_0000_0000$$$::The girl looks up at the sky.[lr]::
73653::$$$message_0678_0000_0001$$$::The gray sunlight clouds her hair, and her red eyes are steeped in shadow.[lr]::
73654::$$$message_0678_0000_0002$$$::"...Yeah. I'd better tell Shirou once he comes home."[lr]::
73655::$$$message_0678_0000_0003$$$::Illyasviel talks out loud, to no one in particular.::
73656::$$$message_0678_0001_0000$$$::The Emiya house is quiet.[lr]::
73657::$$$message_0678_0001_0001$$$::Shirou and Rin both went looking for Sakura.[lr]::
73658::$$$message_0678_0001_0002$$$::Rider doesn't show herself, as usual, so Illya's all by herself.[lr]::
73659::$$$message_0678_0001_0003$$$::"The Cup of Heaven, erected in a cave on this very first promised land, two hundred years ago. I can feel it activating already."[lr]::
73660::$$$message_0678_0001_0004$$$::This is the fifth Holy Grail War to take place in the town of Fuyuki.[lr]::
73661::$$$message_0678_0001_0005$$$::The Holy Grail descends on a different location each time, but this time, it's returned to where it began.::
73662::$$$message_0678_0002_0000$$$::It's only natural.[lr]::
73663::$$$message_0678_0002_0001$$$::They use the four gates in this land, and each time it fails they pick a new one.[lr]::
73664::$$$message_0678_0002_0002$$$::The first was Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
73665::$$$message_0678_0002_0003$$$::The second was the Tohsaka house.[lr]::
73666::$$$message_0678_0002_0004$$$::The third was the church on the hill.[lr]::
73667::$$$message_0678_0002_0005$$$::The fourth was that burned field.[lr]::
73668::$$$message_0678_0002_0006$$$::And this time, it will return to the land it first appeared in.[lr]::
73669::$$$message_0678_0002_0007$$$::To the land where it all started.[lr]::
73670::$$$message_0678_0002_0008$$$::To the false utopia where they first enacted this ritual called the Holy Grail War.::
73671::$$$message_0678_0003_0000$$$::"The Holy Grail is filled with the souls of Heroic Spirits.[lr]::
73672::$$$message_0678_0003_0001$$$::The miracle they sought was to use these and open the gate... But I never thought there would be something living inside, even when it isn't open."[lr]::
73673::$$$message_0678_0003_0002$$$::She finds it rather comical.[lr]::
73674::$$$message_0678_0003_0003$$$::With things as they are, the Einzberns' wish will be for naught.[lr]::
73675::$$$message_0678_0003_0004$$$::They failed.[lr]::
73676::$$$message_0678_0003_0005$$$::Whatever happens next, whatever will soon be born, will be a catastrophe far removed from what they desired.::
73677::$$$message_0678_0004_0000$$$::"...I should leave it alone. My job is only to open the way. No one told me to close it."[lr]::
73678::$$$message_0678_0004_0001$$$::Even if she was willing to try, it's too late now.[lr]::
73679::$$$message_0678_0004_0002$$$::Sakura now surpasses her as a Holy Grail.[lr]::
73680::$$$message_0678_0004_0003$$$::The Einzbern Grail cannot interfere with the gate that the Makiri Grail has opened.[lr]::
73681::$$$message_0678_0004_0004$$$::Zouken Matou meant to open the same thing, but he opened something different.[lr]::
73682::$$$message_0678_0004_0005$$$::Only Illya understands this, along with the other girl turned into a Holy Grail, Sakura.::
73683::$$$message_0678_0005_0000$$$::"I wonder if Shirou will make it back in time. If he does, we could run someplace far away."[lr]::
73684::$$$message_0678_0005_0001$$$::She peers up at the sky, absently.[lr]::
73685::$$$message_0678_0005_0002$$$::The girl has been having doubts.[lr]::
73686::$$$message_0678_0005_0003$$$::She's having trouble choosing between her duty, and the newfound desires in her.::
73687::$$$message_0678_0006_0000$$$::"But Shirou, no matter what you do, I'm still going to die."[lr]::
73688::$$$message_0678_0006_0001$$$::The outcome won't change.[lr]::
73689::$$$message_0678_0006_0002$$$::Only death awaits her, whether she faces the gate as a Holy Grail or runs away.[lr]::
73690::$$$message_0678_0006_0003$$$::That's why she keeps asking herself what she really wants, as she looks up at the gray expanse.::
73691::$$$message_0678_0007_0000$$$::"..."[r]::
73692::$$$message_0678_0007_0001$$$::And that's why she doesn't notice.[lr]::
73693::$$$message_0678_0007_0002$$$::A shadow creeps through the entrance to the house, saying "I'm home."[lr]::
73694::$$$message_0678_0007_0003$$$::Did it infiltrate the Bounded Field around the home, or did the barrier fail to identify her as an intruder?::
73695::$$$message_0678_0008_0000$$$::"..."[r]::
73696::$$$message_0678_0008_0001$$$::Slowly...[lr]::
73697::$$$message_0678_0008_0002$$$::She moves from the living room to the backyard without making a sound, and reaches for the girl's shoulder[line2][lr]::
73698::$$$message_0678_0008_0003$$$::"That was a long walk, Sakura. Where'd you go?"::
73699::$$$message_0678_0009_0000$$$::"Nee...san..."[lr]::
73700::$$$message_0678_0009_0001$$$::The intruder[line2]Sakura Matou freezes.[lr]::
73701::$$$message_0678_0009_0002$$$::She looks away from Illya who is right in front of her, and at Rin Tohsaka waiting in the yard.::
73702::$$$message_0678_0010_0000$$$::"Get away from Illya. I'll shoot you where you stand if you get any closer to her."[lr]::
73703::$$$message_0678_0010_0001$$$::Everyone here knows that it isn't an idle threat.[lr]::
73704::$$$message_0678_0010_0002$$$::"It won't work, Rin. But if it makes you feel better, then go ahead."[lr]::
73705::$$$message_0678_0010_0003$$$::Illyasviel walks out, not looking surprised in the least.[lr]::
73706::$$$message_0678_0010_0004$$$::She goes to the edge of the yard, as if to spectate the face-off between Sakura and Rin.::
73707::$$$message_0678_0011_0000$$$::"...Yeah, you must have been waiting here for me this whole time, Nee-san. You predicted that I'd come invite Illya."[lr]::
73708::$$$message_0678_0011_0001$$$::"Pretty much. Unlike Shirou, I don't have any reason to save you. It was obvious that you'd come to take Illya once things started rolling. Even if you didn't, you had plenty of reason to be cautious of her."::
73709::$$$message_0678_0012_0000$$$::The way she says "Shirou" makes Sakura twitch.[lr]::
73710::$$$message_0678_0012_0001$$$::She doesn't like it.[lr]::
73711::$$$message_0678_0012_0002$$$::The open loathing on her face would be utterly alien to anyone who knew her before.::
73712::$$$message_0678_0013_0000$$$::"...You're terrible, Nee-san. You're always like that, deciding everything on your own and making a fool out of me. You look down on me for being dirty because you're so clean.[lr]::
73713::$$$message_0678_0013_0001$$$::...I hate people like you. Hey, Nee-san. Am I that bad of a girl?"[lr]::
73714::$$$message_0678_0013_0002$$$::Her voice contains no emotion.[lr]::
73715::$$$message_0678_0013_0003$$$::Rin takes the question in stride.::
73716::$$$message_0678_0014_0000$$$::"Obviously. You're a huge moron, beyond saving from the moment you left this house, because you never put any faith in the one guy who wanted to protect Sakura Matou."[lr]::
73717::$$$message_0678_0014_0001$$$::She snaps back at Sakura.::
73718::$$$message_0678_0015_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
73719::$$$message_0678_0015_0001$$$::Sakura drops her gaze.[lr]::
73720::$$$message_0678_0015_0002$$$::The truth of the remark seems to make her genuinely realize her error.::
73721::$$$message_0678_0016_0000$$$::"But, I..."[lr]::
73722::$$$message_0678_0016_0001$$$::"Don't tell me you thought it was for the best. We told you not to go outside. If you didn't agree, you should have talked to us first.[lr]::
73723::$$$message_0678_0016_0002$$$::But you just left without telling anyone, all by yourself. You keep making the same mistakes.[lr]::
73724::$$$message_0678_0016_0003$$$::I'm amazed, honestly. People take advantage of you because you can't even do that part right."::
73725::$$$message_0678_0017_0000$$$::"...Yeah. You're right, that's how it's always been.[lr]::
73726::$$$message_0678_0017_0001$$$::But Nee-san, I'm not weak anymore. Please, go hide in your house. I'll protect Senpai now."[lr]::
73727::$$$message_0678_0017_0002$$$::An ominous shadow spills out in concert with her icy gaze.[lr]::
73728::$$$message_0678_0017_0003$$$::"Rrgh..."[lr]::
73729::$$$message_0678_0017_0004$$$::Expecting this, Rin takes a slight step back.::
73730::$$$message_0678_0018_0000$$$::    She doesn't realize that her moment of weakness[lr]::
73731::$$$message_0678_0018_0001$$$::is the last push Sakura needs.::
73732::$$$message_0678_0019_0000$$$::"...What's wrong, Nee-san? The way you're backing up almost makes you look like you're scared of me."[lr]::
73733::$$$message_0678_0019_0001$$$::"[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]"[lr]::
73734::$$$message_0678_0019_0002$$$::Rin clicks her tongue, realizing her mistake, but it's too late.[lr]::
73735::$$$message_0678_0019_0003$$$::...No.[lr]::
73736::$$$message_0678_0019_0004$$$::She was never ready to begin with.[lr]::
73737::$$$message_0678_0019_0005$$$::From the moment Sakura reached for Illya, it was already over.::
73738::$$$message_0678_0020_0000$$$::"...Okay. So you're not going to go back to your room?"[lr]::
73739::$$$message_0678_0020_0001$$$::"Yes. I won't do what you say anymore."::
73740::$$$message_0678_0021_0000$$$::                                        "Because...I'm stronger than you."::
73741::$$$message_0678_0022_0000$$$::Shadows leap.[lr]::
73742::$$$message_0678_0022_0001$$$::Innumerable jet-black streams rush out from Sakura's feet and cover the yard.[lr]::
73743::$$$message_0678_0022_0002$$$::And from within that thick, inky black...[lr]::
73744::$$$message_0678_0022_0003$$$::"Sakura, you..."[lr]::
73745::$$$message_0678_0022_0004$$$::A knight weilding a dark, tainted sword emerges.::
73746::$$$message_0678_0023_0000$$$::"Saber, capture the Holy Grail. I don't mind if you get rough with it if it resists."[lr]::
73747::$$$message_0678_0023_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
73748::$$$message_0678_0023_0002$$$::The dark Saber obeys without a word.[lr]::
73749::$$$message_0678_0023_0003$$$::...There's no longer any doubt.[lr]::
73750::$$$message_0678_0023_0004$$$::It's clear what the Shadow is now.[lr]::
73751::$$$message_0678_0023_0005$$$::And the fate of any Servant it devours is in plain sight before them. Rin bites her lip.::
73752::$$$message_0678_0024_0000$$$::But then...[lr]::
73753::$$$message_0678_0024_0001$$$::"!"[lr]::
73754::$$$message_0678_0024_0002$$$::"Ngh, hah...!"[lr]::
73755::$$$message_0678_0024_0003$$$::Something shadowy, far surpassing Rin's magical energy[lr]::
73756::$$$message_0678_0024_0004$$$::lashes out at her in a merciless, lethal shot!::
73757::$$$message_0678_0025_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
73758::$$$message_0678_0025_0001$$$::She hits the ground rolling.[lr]::
73759::$$$message_0678_0025_0002$$$::The shadow that was shot out is on the same level as that black Shadow.[lr]::
73760::$$$message_0678_0025_0003$$$::If she touches it, she's finished.[lr]::
73761::$$$message_0678_0025_0004$$$::Even the slightest graze will cause it to stick to Rin's skin and engulf her in the blink of an eye.[lr]::
73762::$$$message_0678_0025_0005$$$::    And once that happens...[lr]::
73763::$$$message_0678_0025_0006$$$::If she's swallowed by the Shadow that not even Servants can escape from, then Rin, a bundle of Magic Circuits, would be absorbed entirely without being able to resist at all.::
73764::$$$message_0678_0026_0000$$$::"Damn it, you...!"[lr]::
73765::$$$message_0678_0026_0001$$$::The tentacles shoot out at her in rapid succession.[lr]::
73766::$$$message_0678_0026_0002$$$::Rin realizes that this isn't coming from the Shadow, but from Sakura's own magecraft.[lr]::
73767::$$$message_0678_0026_0003$$$::The Matous' magecraft specializes in binding others.[lr]::
73768::$$$message_0678_0026_0004$$$::But originally, Sakura was a Tohsaka[line2]a shadow-wielder aligned with imaginary numbers.[lr]::
73769::$$$message_0678_0026_0005$$$::She can manifest the Shadow to this extent because of her two alignments!::
73770::$$$message_0678_0027_0000$$$::"...!!!"[lr]::
73771::$$$message_0678_0027_0001$$$::They catch up to Rin easily.[lr]::
73772::$$$message_0678_0027_0002$$$::The difference in their magical energy is overwhelming.[lr]::
73773::$$$message_0678_0027_0003$$$::Right now, Sakura's magical energy is limitless.[lr]::
73774::$$$message_0678_0027_0004$$$::Her capacity is one hundred million units.[lr]::
73775::$$$message_0678_0027_0005$$$::From the perspective of Rin's three hundred units, Sakura is a monster with a bottomless reserve.::
73776::$$$message_0678_0028_0000$$$::She controls Saber, who boasts the highest magical energy among the Servants, and can freely use the Shadow.[lr]::
73777::$$$message_0678_0028_0001$$$::...It isn't clear if even a Servant could overcome this extraordinary mage.::
73778::$$$message_0678_0029_0000$$$::"...Crap. Her spells are simple, but the quantity is just overwhelming."[lr]::
73779::$$$message_0678_0029_0001$$$::Rin watches the transformed Sakura, her shoulders heaving with exertion.[lr]::
73780::$$$message_0678_0029_0002$$$::She has no chance of victory, and no way out.[lr]::
73781::$$$message_0678_0029_0003$$$::It would be a different story if she had a power source on par with Sakura[line2]the Holy Grail itself[line2]but she doesn't.::
73782::$$$message_0678_0030_0000$$$::"...In terms of being a power source, there isn't anything in this world on the same level as the Holy Grail, anyway."[lr]::
73783::$$$message_0678_0030_0001$$$::She sighs and drowns her anxiety with grumbling.[lr]::
73784::$$$message_0678_0030_0002$$$::"Oh no, Nee-san. It's dangerous to stop there."[lr]::
73785::$$$message_0678_0030_0003$$$::Sakura doesn't hesitate to aim her palm at Rin.::
73786::$$$message_0678_0031_0000$$$::She has no mercy.[lr]::
73787::$$$message_0678_0031_0001$$$::Her lips curl into an arrogant sneer.[lr]::
73788::$$$message_0678_0031_0002$$$::"Now...let's play some more, Nee-san.[lr]::
73789::$$$message_0678_0031_0003$$$::I'll catch you in the end, but try to be adorable and run around, okay?"[lr]::
73790::$$$message_0678_0031_0004$$$::She smiles at her beloved sister.::
73791::$$$message_0678_0032_0000$$$::Rin knows this will end the way Sakura says.[lr]::
73792::$$$message_0678_0032_0001$$$::There's no escaping the Shadow.[lr]::
73793::$$$message_0678_0032_0002$$$::If Sakura felt like it, she could engulf the entire lot, not just the yard.[lr]::
73794::$$$message_0678_0032_0003$$$::Rin's completely helpless against Sakura, who expands the Shadow little by little.::
73795::$$$message_0678_0033_0000$$$::"Ngh...ahh...Ahh..."[lr]::
73796::$$$message_0678_0033_0001$$$::The Shadow wraps around Rin.[lr]::
73797::$$$message_0678_0033_0002$$$::The gel-like mud binds her body, squeezes her tight, and infiltrates her Magic Circuits like a bloodborne parasite.::
73798::$$$message_0678_0034_0000$$$::"Oh, is that all? You weren't as strong as I thought."[lr]::
73799::$$$message_0678_0034_0001$$$::Sakura gleefully looks down at her captured sister.[lr]::
73800::$$$message_0678_0034_0002$$$::   Her breathing is ragged, and her cheeks are flushed.[lr]::
73801::$$$message_0678_0034_0003$$$::The sight of her sister smeared with thick oil excites Sakura, even though she's female.::
73802::$$$message_0678_0035_0000$$$::"Saku...ra..."[lr]::
73803::$$$message_0678_0035_0001$$$::The mud doesn't cover her face, as if to let Sakura enjoy her suffering.[lr]::
73804::$$$message_0678_0035_0002$$$::"You...little..."[lr]::
73805::$$$message_0678_0035_0003$$$::Rin glares at Sakura, enduring the humiliation.[lr]::
73806::$$$message_0678_0035_0004$$$::But it only lasts for a few seconds.[lr]::
73807::$$$message_0678_0035_0005$$$::The mud working its way through her body oozes its way into her organs.::
73808::$$$message_0678_0036_0000$$$::"Kugh...! Nn-nngah, haah..."[lr]::
73809::$$$message_0678_0036_0001$$$::"Hehe. I'll be eating you now. I've been looking forward to this. It's my first time eating magical energy from a mage."[lr]::
73810::$$$message_0678_0036_0002$$$::The gel-like shadows bind Rin tightly.[lr]::
73811::$$$message_0678_0036_0003$$$::The "meal" doesn't even last a few seconds.::
73812::$$$message_0678_0037_0000$$$::"Ah... Ngh..."[lr]::
73813::$$$message_0678_0037_0001$$$::"Delicious... I'm not even close to full, but that was satisfying, Nee-san."[lr]::
73814::$$$message_0678_0037_0002$$$::Rin's remaining magical energy disappears.[lr]::
73815::$$$message_0678_0037_0003$$$::It's over.[lr]::
73816::$$$message_0678_0037_0004$$$::Slumped over and struggling to breathe, Rin doesn't have the strength to resist.[lr]::
73817::$$$message_0678_0037_0005$$$::She has no way to resist, but...::
73818::$$$message_0678_0038_0000$$$::"I can't let that happen. Unless I kill her here, next time..."[lr]::
73819::$$$message_0678_0038_0001$$$::She'll lose to her sister again.[lr]::
73820::$$$message_0678_0038_0002$$$::...She doesn't have anything to base this hunch on.[lr]::
73821::$$$message_0678_0038_0003$$$::Rin has no way of overcoming this power gap.[lr]::
73822::$$$message_0678_0038_0004$$$::But somehow, Sakura is sure that the next time they fight, Rin will kill her for sure.::
73823::$$$message_0678_0039_0000$$$::So she needs to finish her off here.[lr]::
73824::$$$message_0678_0039_0001$$$::It would be too easy to simply neutralize her by taking her energy.[lr]::
73825::$$$message_0678_0039_0002$$$::She needs to end her here, because Rin Tohsaka would do the same.[lr]::
73826::$$$message_0678_0039_0003$$$::That's what Sakura tells herself as she spreads her trembling hand.::
73827::$$$message_0678_0040_0000$$$::"Nee-san, here..."[lr]::
73828::$$$message_0678_0040_0001$$$::The shadow doesn't spread.[lr]::
73829::$$$message_0678_0040_0002$$$::With shaking shoulders, she looks at her weakened sister, and[line2][lr]::
73830::$$$message_0678_0040_0003$$$::"SAKURA!!!"[lr]::
73831::$$$message_0678_0040_0004$$$::The last person she wanted to meet finally catches up to her.Ïb
