75017::$$$message_0690_0000_0000$$$::"Let's get back on topic. Going forward, I think we shouldn't let Sakura go outside. It's too dangerous if she runs into Zouken. I'll deal with the old man."::
75018::$$$message_0690_0001_0000$$$::"Your thinking is correct. However, how will you defeat the mage? Do you have any ideas?"[lr]::
75019::$$$message_0690_0001_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75020::$$$message_0690_0001_0002$$$::...I'm not sure what to say to that.[lr]::
75021::$$$message_0690_0001_0003$$$::I'm sure there are ways to beat him, but I haven't given much thought to picking one.::
75022::$$$message_0690_0002_0000$$$::"Well..."[lr]::
75023::$$$message_0690_0002_0001$$$::...My fate depends on my next choice.[lr]::
75024::$$$message_0690_0002_0002$$$::I have multiple options.[lr]::
75025::$$$message_0690_0002_0003$$$::Out of them, the most viable one would be...::
75026::$$$message_0690_0003_0000$$$::"I think we should cooperate with another Master.[lr]::
75027::$$$message_0690_0003_0001$$$::I'm not saying we can get them to sympathize with us, but there might be someone willing to help us defeat Zouken."::
75028::$$$message_0690_0004_0000$$$::"Another Master... You mean Tohsaka-senpai?"[lr]::
75029::$$$message_0690_0004_0001$$$::"Huh? No, not her. I'm acquainted with Berserker's Master. Her name is Illya, and she'll listen to what I have to say."::
75030::$$$message_0690_0005_0000$$$::...To be honest, I can't leave Illya be, either.[lr]::
75031::$$$message_0690_0005_0001$$$::Tohsaka aside, I have no idea what Zouken will do next.[lr]::
75032::$$$message_0690_0005_0002$$$::He was willing to force Sakura to fight by planting worms in her.[lr]::
75033::$$$message_0690_0005_0003$$$::Illya and Berserker are much stronger in direct combat, but Zouken is a schemer. He knows he can't win in a duel, so he'll use other methods.[lr]::
75034::$$$message_0690_0005_0004$$$::So, Illya can't get careless, even if she has Berserker.::
75035::$$$message_0690_0006_0000$$$::"Berserker... You want us to ally with that mad warrior?"[lr]::
75036::$$$message_0690_0006_0001$$$::"We don't necessarily need to be allies, but we could convince them not to attack us. And even if we can't work together, I want to warn them."::
75037::$$$message_0690_0007_0000$$$::That girl came to this town all alone.[lr]::
75038::$$$message_0690_0007_0001$$$::Illya was raised to be a Master and given the name Einzbern. She's more than just a stranger to me.::
75039::$$$message_0690_0008_0000$$$::"I...see. Do you know where this Illya is?"[lr]::
75040::$$$message_0690_0008_0001$$$::"Yeah, she showed me before. I still remember the way there. It was a really big forest, so I'm sure it won't be easy to get there, but it should take about half a day."::
75041::$$$message_0690_0009_0000$$$::"Half a day... So are you leaving now?"[lr]::
75042::$$$message_0690_0009_0001$$$::"Yeah. It's better to strike while the iron's hot, and if I go now, I can be back by nightfall."::
75043::$$$message_0690_0010_0000$$$::It's a rushed decision, but a timely one.[lr]::
75044::$$$message_0690_0010_0001$$$::I've been wanting to thank Illya for her help yesterday.::
75045::$$$message_0690_0011_0000$$$::Moreover...[lr]::
75046::$$$message_0690_0011_0001$$$::I have a feeling that everything will change once I bring up Zouken's schemes and that unknown Shadow.::
75047::$$$message_0690_0012_0000$$$::"I'm leaving. I'll be back as soon as I can, so try to get some rest in your room."[lr]::
75048::$$$message_0690_0012_0001$$$::"All right, Senpai. But at least take Rider with you. She'll protect you if anything happens."::
75049::$$$message_0690_0013_0000$$$::"Oh, right. That would be safer."[lr]::
75050::$$$message_0690_0013_0001$$$::...But I can't do that.[lr]::
75051::$$$message_0690_0013_0002$$$::It's just as dangerous to leave Sakura at home by herself.[lr]::
75052::$$$message_0690_0013_0003$$$::No, much more dangerous, since she can't defend herself against Zouken.::
75053::$$$message_0690_0014_0000$$$::"No[line2]Rider, you stay home with Sakura.[lr]::
75054::$$$message_0690_0014_0001$$$::If Zouken shows up, avoid fighting since that will use magical energy. Take Sakura and run. He won't be able to keep up with you."[lr]::
75055::$$$message_0690_0014_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75056::$$$message_0690_0014_0003$$$::Rider solmenly nods, as if she had the same idea.::
75057::$$$message_0690_0015_0000$$$::"See? Rider agrees with me. You need to stay home today, Sakura."[lr]::
75058::$$$message_0690_0015_0001$$$::"...But you're in danger, too. That forest is..."[lr]::
75059::$$$message_0690_0015_0002$$$::"Don't worry. If it looks dangerous, I'll run away immediately. Illya doesn't have any interest in people who aren't Masters, anyway. I won't be in any danger."::
75060::$$$message_0690_0016_0000$$$::I give Sakura a reassuring clap on the shoulder and leave the living room.[lr]::
75061::$$$message_0690_0016_0001$$$::   Now, then.[lr]::
75062::$$$message_0690_0016_0002$$$::First, I'll go to the shed and prep something I can use as a weapon.::
75063::$$$message_0690_0017_0000$$$::Sakura sees me off as I leave the Emiya house.[lr]::
75064::$$$message_0690_0017_0001$$$::I'm carrying two wooden swords in a tubular shinai bag, and something light to eat later.[lr]::
75065::$$$message_0690_0017_0002$$$::I don't have a map or a compass.[lr]::
75066::$$$message_0690_0017_0003$$$::I still have the sense of direction I got from the magecraft Illya cast on me. All I can do is rely on the memory of what I saw, and my own intuition.::
75067::$$$message_0690_0018_0000$$$::"...It isn't ten o'clock yet. One hour by taxi, and then four more hours walking through the forest..."[lr]::
75068::$$$message_0690_0018_0001$$$::I hope it only takes that long.::
75069::$$$message_0690_0019_0000$$$::Anyway, I'll have the taxi drive slowly while I look for the entrance to the forest that I saw the other day.[lr]::
75070::$$$message_0690_0019_0001$$$::Once I find it, I'll leave the car and walk the rest of the way.[lr]::
75071::$$$message_0690_0019_0002$$$::   If all goes well, I should make it to Illya's castle before sundown.[lr]::
75072::$$$message_0690_0019_0003$$$::I'll think about what to do next once I meet Illya.::
75073::$$$message_0690_0020_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
75074::$$$message_0690_0020_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
75075::$$$message_0690_0020_0002$$$::...[lr]::
75076::$$$message_0690_0020_0003$$$::I hear something nostalgic from my house behind me.[lr]::
75077::$$$message_0690_0020_0004$$$::That businesslike and cool way of addressing me.[lr]::
75078::$$$message_0690_0020_0005$$$::The way she said my name politely and awkwardly, yet as kindly as she could.::
75079::$$$message_0690_0021_0000$$$::"Sa[line2]"[lr]::
75080::$$$message_0690_0021_0001$$$::I say a name that can't possibly be here.[lr]::
75081::$$$message_0690_0021_0002$$$::"Wait. I have something to say before you leave."::
75082::$$$message_0690_0022_0000$$$::"Ri...der."[lr]::
75083::$$$message_0690_0022_0001$$$::As I turn around, I accept reality.[lr]::
75084::$$$message_0690_0022_0002$$$::This is Rider.[lr]::
75085::$$$message_0690_0022_0003$$$::The girl who said my name in that way isn't here anymore.::
75086::$$$message_0690_0023_0000$$$::"Sure. But make it quick, since I'm on the clock."[lr]::
75087::$$$message_0690_0023_0001$$$::"I just have one question. You said that you would protect Sakura. You have yet to tell me why, Shirou Emiya."::
75088::$$$message_0690_0024_0000$$$::"So you don't trust me?"[lr]::
75089::$$$message_0690_0024_0001$$$::"Yes. I do not know you as well as Sakura does."[lr]::
75090::$$$message_0690_0024_0002$$$::"..."::
75091::$$$message_0690_0025_0000$$$::That makes sense.[lr]::
75092::$$$message_0690_0025_0001$$$::Rider wants to protect Sakura, not me.[lr]::
75093::$$$message_0690_0025_0002$$$::So she probably wants to know what I'm thinking, at least.::
75094::$$$message_0690_0026_0000$$$::"...Whew. I'm only going to say this once, so don't ask again. I'm not being vain, I just don't like saying it in front of others."[lr]::
75095::$$$message_0690_0026_0001$$$::"..."::
75096::$$$message_0690_0027_0000$$$::"Okay. I love Sakura. But that's not all.[lr]::
75097::$$$message_0690_0027_0001$$$::Last night, I gave Sakura my..."[lr]::
75098::$$$message_0690_0027_0002$$$::"...It appears so. Her magical energy was stable this morning. Without an external supply of energy, she would have suffered from another fever.[lr]::
75099::$$$message_0690_0027_0003$$$::But what of it?"::
75100::$$$message_0690_0028_0000$$$::"That's all. I love Sakura. That's all the reason I need to protect her. I think it's perfectly natural for a man to protect the woman he loves."[lr]::
75101::$$$message_0690_0028_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
75102::$$$message_0690_0029_0000$$$::"...And will you fight for her sake? You say that your goal is to heal her body. Will you give her the Holy Grail and not use it for your own benefit?"::
75103::$$$message_0690_0030_0000$$$::"Oh, I'll use it. I don't know what the Holy Grail is, but I'll use it as much as it takes to make her happy."[lr]::
75104::$$$message_0690_0030_0001$$$::"You'll make Sakura happy?"[lr]::
75105::$$$message_0690_0030_0002$$$::"Yeah. She's suffered alone all this time. So I'll do whatever it takes to make her just as happy."::
75106::$$$message_0690_0031_0000$$$::Rider says nothing. She just stands there.[lr]::
75107::$$$message_0690_0031_0001$$$::...Maybe now she knows why I'm embarrassed to say this out loud.::
75108::$$$message_0690_0032_0000$$$::"All right. I answered your question, so now it's my turn to ask. It's a request, too. Will you hear me out?"[lr]::
75109::$$$message_0690_0032_0001$$$::"Y-yes. If it's within my power, I will hear you out."::
75110::$$$message_0690_0033_0000$$$::"It's simple. Could you pronounce my name with a different accent than the one you used earlier?"::
75111::$$$message_0690_0034_0000$$$::"Hm? Very well... ShiROU, then?"[lr]::
75112::$$$message_0690_0034_0001$$$::"Uh, no. That's how you say 'grave wax.' Be more, I dunno..."[lr]::
75113::$$$message_0690_0034_0002$$$::"Um, Sh-Shirou. Shi-ro. Shiroh. Shero. Shee-rou. Shi-row, no, Shirou, Shirou."::
75114::$$$message_0690_0035_0000$$$::Rider grapples with the pronunciation.[lr]::
75115::$$$message_0690_0035_0001$$$::...Guess not, then. I just caused her trouble by making her try multiple times.[lr]::
75116::$$$message_0690_0035_0002$$$::Rider's blindfold and dark clothes give her a thorny image, but she's actually quite sociable.[lr]::
75117::$$$message_0690_0035_0003$$$::Somehow, I get the impression that she would be a little clumsy in private life.::
75118::$$$message_0690_0036_0000$$$::"Sorry. You can just say it the old way."[lr]::
75119::$$$message_0690_0036_0001$$$::"Shirou. Hmm, is this pronunciation correct, Shirou?"[lr]::
75120::$$$message_0690_0036_0002$$$::"Yeah, no complaints. Sorry for being so selfish."::
75121::$$$message_0690_0037_0000$$$::"Selfish? You didn't like it when I said it the other way, right? I think it's only right of me to correct my pronunciation." [lr]::
75122::$$$message_0690_0037_0001$$$::"Not at all, actually. I liked it."::
75123::$$$message_0690_0038_0000$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
75124::$$$message_0690_0038_0001$$$::It's because I liked it that I don't want anyone else to say it that way.[lr]::
75125::$$$message_0690_0038_0002$$$::I know it's a silly thing to get hung up on, but I want her to be the only one to say my name that way.::
75126::$$$message_0690_0039_0000$$$::"I really am just being selfish. You didn't do anything wrong."[lr]::
75127::$$$message_0690_0039_0001$$$::"...Very well. Then I won't ask why."[lr]::
75128::$$$message_0690_0039_0002$$$::"Yeah. Anyway, I'm leaving. Take care of Sakura, Rider!"::
75129::$$$message_0690_0040_0000$$$::I wave at Rider and start running.[lr]::
75130::$$$message_0690_0040_0001$$$::First I need to go to the intersection and hail a taxi.[lr]::
75131::$$$message_0690_0040_0002$$$::I'll take it to the outskirts of town and find the entrance to the forest that I've only seen once.::
