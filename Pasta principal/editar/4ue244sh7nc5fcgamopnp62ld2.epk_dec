59345::$$$message_0538_0000_0000$$$::...Should I try using a Command Spell?[lr]::
59346::$$$message_0538_0000_0001$$$::I don't think Saber would lose to Assassin.[lr]::
59347::$$$message_0538_0000_0002$$$::But this situation is too unfavorable.[lr]::
59348::$$$message_0538_0000_0003$$$::This is that old fiend we're talking here. It's too dangerous to let Saber fight alone.::
59349::$$$message_0538_0001_0000$$$::"So you've managed to rein in that clumsy bloodlust. You must be scheming something."::
59350::$$$message_0538_0002_0000$$$::His chuckle is condescending.[lr]::
59351::$$$message_0538_0002_0001$$$::It's a laugh that says he'll let me try anything I want, since it's all child's play.::
59352::$$$message_0538_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59353::$$$message_0538_0003_0001$$$::Fine, go ahead and laugh.[lr]::
59354::$$$message_0538_0003_0002$$$::If Command Spells are supposed to respond to my wishes, then I'll use as many as it takes to call Saber back!::
59355::$$$message_0538_0004_0000$$$::"Saber!"[lr]::
59356::$$$message_0538_0004_0001$$$::Without taking my eyes off the shadows before me, I focus my will on my left hand.[lr]::
59357::$$$message_0538_0004_0002$$$::I give one simple order.[lr]::
59358::$$$message_0538_0004_0003$$$::I call Saber back to my side immediately!::
59359::$$$message_0538_0005_0000$$$::"Mngh!?"[lr]::
59360::$$$message_0538_0005_0001$$$::He notices too late.[lr]::
59361::$$$message_0538_0005_0002$$$::My left hand blazes with warmth, releasing its compressed magical energy in response to its Master's wishes...[lr]::
59362::$$$message_0538_0005_0003$$$::...and loses its color after a brief moment of pain.::
59363::$$$message_0538_0006_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
59364::$$$message_0538_0006_0001$$$::   I wish it only failed.[lr]::
59365::$$$message_0538_0006_0002$$$::I'd like to believe that I used it wrong, because I don't know how it works.::
59366::$$$message_0538_0007_0000$$$::"...Phew. Looks like it's over. That gave me quite a fright. It must have taken ten years off my life."[lr]::
59367::$$$message_0538_0007_0001$$$::His laughter grates on my ears.[lr]::
59368::$$$message_0538_0007_0002$$$::...Far away, I hear wind howling, like a death cry.::
59369::$$$message_0538_0008_0000$$$::My left hand throbs in pain.[lr]::
59370::$$$message_0538_0008_0001$$$::The back of my hand is tingling.[lr]::
59371::$$$message_0538_0008_0002$$$::It hurts where the Command Spells are, almost like I'm bleeding there.::
59372::$$$message_0538_0009_0000$$$::"It...can't be..."[lr]::
59373::$$$message_0538_0009_0001$$$::I feel awful dread.[lr]::
59374::$$$message_0538_0009_0002$$$::I feel awful dread.[lr]::
59375::$$$message_0538_0009_0003$$$::I feel awful dread.[lr]::
59376::$$$message_0538_0009_0004$$$::The pain in my left hand.[lr]::
59377::$$$message_0538_0009_0005$$$::The howling wind, gone silent.[lr]::
59378::$$$message_0538_0009_0006$$$::The old, insect-wielding mage, laughter filling the room with his bloodlust.::
59379::$$$message_0538_0010_0000$$$::"No, it's cold hard reality. If you're her Master, you should be able to tell that your Servant is gone from this world!"::
59380::$$$message_0538_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59381::$$$message_0538_0011_0001$$$::My mind is paralyzed.[lr]::
59382::$$$message_0538_0011_0002$$$::My vision freezes.[lr]::
59383::$$$message_0538_0011_0003$$$::What...is he talking about?::
59384::$$$message_0538_0012_0000$$$::"What are you so shocked for? Saber is dead. She underestimated Assassin and lost to him. Is that so hard to grasp, boy?"[lr]::
59385::$$$message_0538_0012_0001$$$::"That's..."::
59386::$$$message_0538_0013_0000$$$::...bullshit, right?[lr]::
59387::$$$message_0538_0013_0001$$$::My left hand hurts.[lr]::
59388::$$$message_0538_0013_0002$$$::It really hurts.[lr]::
59389::$$$message_0538_0013_0003$$$::But my Command Spells are still there.[lr]::
59390::$$$message_0538_0013_0004$$$::They're growing fainter by the second, like they're about to fade, but they aren't gone yet.[lr]::
59391::$$$message_0538_0013_0005$$$::Then Saber still has to be out there, ready to come to me right now!::
59392::$$$message_0538_0014_0000$$$::"Don't you..."[lr]::
59393::$$$message_0538_0014_0001$$$::"Let's put an end to this. The Tohsaka girl still has potential, but I have no further use for you. Die in my holy land, along with your Servant!"[lr]::
59394::$$$message_0538_0014_0002$$$::"...BULLSHIT ME, MOTHERFUCKER!"::
59395::$$$message_0538_0015_0000$$$::I run.[lr]::
59396::$$$message_0538_0015_0001$$$::I charge at the enemy before me, trying to shake off the pain in my left hand and the horrible dread.::
