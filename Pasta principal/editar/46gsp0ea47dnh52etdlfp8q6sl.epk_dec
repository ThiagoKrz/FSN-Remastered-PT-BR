54455::$$$message_0482_0000_0000$$$::Tohsaka's magical examination ends rather quickly.[lr]::
54456::$$$message_0482_0000_0001$$$::She lit some incense and did something that looked like a tarot card reading. Then, I answered some questions that reminded me of a personality test.::
54457::$$$message_0482_0001_0000$$$::According to her...[lr]::
54458::$$$message_0482_0001_0001$$$::"You don't correspond to anything. I won't bother trying anything else."[lr]::
54459::$$$message_0482_0001_0002$$$::She gives up quickly on trying to identify my Magic Circuits.::
54460::$$$message_0482_0002_0000$$$::"Wow. So you can't tell?"::
54461::$$$message_0482_0003_0000$$$::"That's rude. I figured out that you don't correspond to any of the Five Great Elements. Any consecration beyond that falls outside of my area of expertise, so there isn't any point in going further, is there?[lr]::
54462::$$$message_0482_0003_0001$$$::Next, show me the magecraft you can use. I can make some estimates based on that."::
54463::$$$message_0482_0004_0000$$$::...So she says.[lr]::
54464::$$$message_0482_0004_0001$$$::Next, I practiced my Strengthening magecraft on the clay lump that Tohsaka gave me.::
54465::$$$message_0482_0005_0000$$$::Clay is a lump of ether, and always returns to being a lump no matter what you do to it, so it's very conducive to magical energy.[lr]::
54466::$$$message_0482_0005_0001$$$::I was a little worried it might get stuck once I Strengthened it, but...::
54467::$$$message_0482_0006_0000$$$::"It's like a shiniku, so don't worry about it. No matter how much energy you cram into it, it'll go back to how it was in a day."[lr]::
54468::$$$message_0482_0006_0001$$$::...so she said.[lr]::
54469::$$$message_0482_0006_0002$$$::By the way, she said a shiniku is a lump of meat that never gets any smaller no matter how much of it you eat. It's called a shirou in Chinese mythology.::
54470::$$$message_0482_0007_0000$$$::...Anyway, I tried Strengthening the lump of clay.[lr]::
54471::$$$message_0482_0007_0001$$$::I didn't want to fail in front of her, but I only managed to pull it off twice in ten attempts.[lr]::
54472::$$$message_0482_0007_0002$$$::It even took me much longer to manifest my Magic Circuit than I did when Saber was still around.::
54473::$$$message_0482_0008_0000$$$::While I practiced Strengthening, Tohsaka asked me questions, such as,[lr]::
54474::$$$message_0482_0008_0001$$$::whether I came up with my own incantation, whether I can use magecraft other than Strengthening, how I was trained, what I form mental images of most easily, and so on.::
54475::$$$message_0482_0009_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
54476::$$$message_0482_0009_0001$$$::Tohsaka's face darkened, until she eventually stopped saying anything.[lr]::
54477::$$$message_0482_0009_0002$$$::I don't know what I did to upset her, but having her make that face this close to mine was very uncomfortable.::
54478::$$$message_0482_0010_0000$$$::"Tohsaka? Um, maybe this is a stupid question, but are you regretting teaming up with me because of how inexperienced I am?"::
54479::$$$message_0482_0011_0000$$$::"Huh? Well, yeah but...you aren't just inexperienced. It's like your way of thinking is incorrect. I'm surprised you've managed to live this long, operating like that."::
54480::$$$message_0482_0012_0000$$$::"? Earth to Tohsaka! I don't follow!"[lr]::
54481::$$$message_0482_0012_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
54482::$$$message_0482_0012_0002$$$::Why are you glaring at me like that?::
54483::$$$message_0482_0013_0000$$$::"...Fine. Looks like I'll need to fix you from square one. Going back to what I asked before, do you still have any Projections in your atelier?"[lr]::
54484::$$$message_0482_0013_0001$$$::"Yeah. They stay as long as you don't break them, don't they?"::
54485::$$$message_0482_0014_0000$$$::She asked me that earlier, when I mentioned trying Projection during breaks when Strengthening wasn't going well.[lr]::
54486::$$$message_0482_0014_0001$$$::Tohsaka pressed me hard for details about that and, just once, asked me to Project something using the clay lump.[lr]::
54487::$$$message_0482_0014_0002$$$::She asked me to make an earthenware pot. It went well until about halfway, then it failed.::
54488::$$$message_0482_0015_0000$$$::"Hmph. All right, I'm going to teach you how to flip your switch on and off.[lr]::
54489::$$$message_0482_0015_0001$$$::It's actually a lot faster to create the switch inside your body, so I want you to sleep over tonight. You'll need the sleep after such a rough procedure."::
54490::$$$message_0482_0016_0000$$$::"Wait, sleep over? Here?"[lr]::
54491::$$$message_0482_0016_0001$$$::"Why are you looking at me like that? Don't worry, I won't cut you open with a scalpel. I'm just going to have you swallow something. You won't be able to move for a while because of how strong it is.::
54492::$$$message_0482_0017_0000$$$::"Oh, uh, I wasn't worried about the procedure..."[lr]::
54493::$$$message_0482_0017_0001$$$::...I look at the clock.[lr]::
54494::$$$message_0482_0017_0002$$$::It's already past five o'clock.[lr]::
54495::$$$message_0482_0017_0003$$$::I didn't notice because of the cloudy weather, but it's already evening.::
54496::$$$message_0482_0018_0000$$$::Tohsaka is looking out for me as both an ally and a mage.[lr]::
54497::$$$message_0482_0018_0001$$$::It's a big help and it makes me happy, but I'm still worried about Sakura back at home.[lr]::
54498::$$$message_0482_0018_0002$$$::I...[lr])½m®
