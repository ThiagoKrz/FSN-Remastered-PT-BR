77152::$$$message_0719_0000_0000$$$::"...Master. This concludes my abbreviated explanation."[lr]::
77153::$$$message_0719_0000_0001$$$::"Yeah. It's a lot to take in, but it makes sense. Sorry for the trouble, Saber."::
77154::$$$message_0719_0001_0000$$$::"...There is no need to apologize.[lr]::
77155::$$$message_0719_0001_0001$$$::You need to understand the situation we're in to make decisions about our next steps."[lr]::
77156::$$$message_0719_0001_0002$$$::Saber leans forward attentively, awaiting my next words.::
77157::$$$message_0719_0002_0000$$$::This tells me...[lr]::
77158::$$$message_0719_0002_0001$$$::Saber is probably the same as Tohsaka: she's the sort to strike first.[lr]::
77159::$$$message_0719_0002_0002$$$::While that's valid, I can't decide our next course of action before I know what I'm even supposed to be doing.::
77160::$$$message_0719_0003_0000$$$::"Hmm... I guess...we can't just wait and see. I don't know what the other Masters are like, and I'm curious about Illya. If I'm trying to avoid creating more victims, then we should probably try to find the other Masters..."::
77161::$$$message_0719_0004_0000$$$::Aimlessly wandering through the city seems dangerous.[lr]::
77162::$$$message_0719_0004_0001$$$::...But I can't come up with anything better.[lr]::
77163::$$$message_0719_0004_0002$$$::Maybe I should have teamed up with Tohsaka after all.::
77164::$$$message_0719_0005_0000$$$::"Illya...? Does Berserker's Master concern you, Shirou?"::
77165::$$$message_0719_0006_0000$$$::"Eh...? Oh, nah. I'm just wondering why she's after us.[lr]::
77166::$$$message_0719_0006_0001$$$::Actually, I've met her before yesterday. Though it was just in passing. I've heard the name 'Einzbern' before, too."::
77167::$$$message_0719_0007_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
77168::$$$message_0719_0007_0001$$$::That seems to catch Saber's attention.[lr]::
77169::$$$message_0719_0007_0002$$$::She makes an inscrutable face at the mention of "Einzbern."::
77170::$$$message_0719_0008_0000$$$::"Saber? Have you heard of the Einzbern name before, too?"[lr]::
77171::$$$message_0719_0008_0001$$$::"...I know the name. Are you familiar with it, Shirou?"::
77172::$$$message_0719_0009_0000$$$::"No, I wouldn't say that. I just heard it in passing. Before we met her, someone who has nothing to do with all this asked me if the daughter of the Einzberns was doing well."[lr]::
77173::$$$message_0719_0009_0001$$$::"...I see. Then you don't know anything."[lr]::
77174::$$$message_0719_0009_0002$$$::Saber closes her eyes in a moment of thought.::
77175::$$$message_0719_0010_0000$$$::"...This must be fated, somehow. If you wish to learn more of the Einzberns, then you should visit the church again.[lr]::
77176::$$$message_0719_0010_0001$$$::That priest will be able to shed some light on your questions and your next course of action."::
77177::$$$message_0719_0011_0000$$$::"The church...? You mean the same one from yesterday? But I'm not supposed to go there anymore. The priest said only to come back if I'm going to forfeit being a Master."::
77178::$$$message_0719_0012_0000$$$::"That was just a white lie. The rules that priest enforces are a contrivance of the Mage's Association meant to control the battle between mages. Since you don't belong to the Association, there is no purpose in obeying them."[lr]::
77179::$$$message_0719_0012_0001$$$::"Hm..."::
77180::$$$message_0719_0013_0000$$$::...She's right.[lr]::
77181::$$$message_0719_0013_0001$$$::Tohsaka's part of the Association, but the Emiya family are a bunch of outlaws that have nothing to do with them.[lr]::
77182::$$$message_0719_0013_0002$$$::I won't get anything out of following the Association's laws, so I can just ignore them like my old man did.::
77183::$$$message_0719_0014_0000$$$::"Do you understand now? That church is a shelter of last resort for you, but you're under no obligation to obey their laws."[lr]::
77184::$$$message_0719_0014_0001$$$::"...I suppose you're right. But I still want to avoid it if I can. I have a feeling that I shouldn't see that priest any more than I have to."::
77185::$$$message_0719_0015_0000$$$::Kirei Kotomine.[lr]::
77186::$$$message_0719_0015_0001$$$::I have a hunch that something's wrong with him.[lr]::
77187::$$$message_0719_0015_0002$$$::It isn't a feeling of hostility like I can't trust him or that he's a threat.[lr]::
77188::$$$message_0719_0015_0003$$$::...I shouldn't be around him.[lr]::
77189::$$$message_0719_0015_0004$$$::I'm afraid that the more I'm around him, the more of myself that I've built up over time will crumble away.::
77190::$$$message_0719_0016_0000$$$::"I know how you feel, Shirou. I agree. We should avoid associating with him if possible."[lr]::
77191::$$$message_0719_0016_0001$$$::Saber concurs with a dignified look.[lr]::
77192::$$$message_0719_0016_0002$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
77193::$$$message_0719_0016_0003$$$::That's a surprise.[lr]::
77194::$$$message_0719_0016_0004$$$::I never expected Saber, a Heroic Spirit, to feel awkward over associating with mere humans. After all...::
77195::$$$message_0719_0017_0000$$$::"Leaving me aside, why do you feel that way?[lr]::
77196::$$$message_0719_0017_0001$$$::You haven't even met him."[lr]::
77197::$$$message_0719_0017_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77198::$$$message_0719_0017_0003$$$::Saber hesitates.[lr]::
77199::$$$message_0719_0017_0004$$$::After a frown of indecision, she raises her head as if her doubts have been dispelled.::
77200::$$$message_0719_0018_0000$$$::"He participated in the previous Holy Grail War.[lr]::
77201::$$$message_0719_0018_0001$$$::I don't know which Servant he was the Master of, but Kiritsugu was cautious of him until the very end."::
77202::$$$message_0719_0019_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
77203::$$$message_0719_0019_0001$$$::I know that.[lr]::
77204::$$$message_0719_0019_0002$$$::I know that already, but Saber, did you just[line2][lr]::
77205::$$$message_0719_0019_0003$$$::"Sa...ber... How do you know my old man's name?"::
77206::$$$message_0719_0020_0000$$$::"I said I was Kiritsugu's Servant.[lr]::
77207::$$$message_0719_0020_0001$$$::Kiritsugu Emiya was one of the Masters in the last Holy Grail War. I fought alongside him for the Grail, and we won.[lr]::
77208::$$$message_0719_0020_0002$$$::Kiritsugu judged that priest to be the greatest threat of all the participants. He said that if we lost, it would be to him."::
77209::$$$message_0719_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77210::$$$message_0719_0021_0001$$$::Wait.[lr]::
77211::$$$message_0719_0021_0002$$$::But that means...[lr]::
77212::$$$message_0719_0021_0003$$$::Kiritsugu was a Master in the last war, who fought alongside Saber, and...[lr]::
77213::$$$message_0719_0021_0004$$$::one of the people who caused that hell to happen?::
77214::$$$message_0719_0022_0000$$$::"...No way. How could it be? Why didn't Kotomine say anything? Why didn't the old man tell me?"::
77215::$$$message_0719_0023_0000$$$::"I do not know. I never did know what Kiritsugu was thinking.[lr]::
77216::$$$message_0719_0023_0001$$$::If the priest didn't mention it, then you must not have asked. He is the type of man to answer anything people ask him. I believe he will tell you the truth, if you bring it up."::
77217::$$$message_0719_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77218::$$$message_0719_0024_0001$$$::Saber watches me silently.[lr]::
77219::$$$message_0719_0024_0002$$$::Her green eyes state my obligation as a Master: [lr]::
77220::$$$message_0719_0024_0003$$$::if I want to know the truth about Kiritsugu Emiya, then I should willingly go to the church.::
77221::$$$message_0719_0025_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
77222::$$$message_0719_0025_0001$$$::I walk to the church.[lr]::
77223::$$$message_0719_0025_0002$$$::Saber's wearing the same outfit again, guarding me.::
77224::$$$message_0719_0026_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
77225::$$$message_0719_0026_0001$$$::My gaze is fixed on the church.[lr]::
77226::$$$message_0719_0026_0002$$$::...I came here at Saber's suggestion, but maybe I'm still not mentally ready.[lr]::
77227::$$$message_0719_0026_0003$$$::As I push on the door, I don't feel particularly motivated to ask the priest about what happened ten years ago.::
77228::$$$message_0719_0027_0000$$$::"Master."[lr]::
77229::$$$message_0719_0027_0001$$$::I turn to look at the girl behind me.[lr]::
77230::$$$message_0719_0027_0002$$$::"I will wait here. You should face the priest alone."::
77231::$$$message_0719_0028_0000$$$::"...I know. I'm not leaving, not after I came all this way."[lr]::
77232::$$$message_0719_0028_0001$$$::"Please do not tell the priest that you summoned me.[lr]::
77233::$$$message_0719_0028_0002$$$::You shouldn't reveal that the same Heroic Spirit has been summoned twice."::
77234::$$$message_0719_0029_0000$$$::"Yeah. I'll just ask about Kiritsugu. I'll be right back, so hang in there."[lr]::
77235::$$$message_0719_0029_0001$$$::"...Yes. Be careful, Shirou. If there is danger, call me immediately. There is something wicked about that priest. There is no telling what might happen if you let your guard down."::
77236::$$$message_0719_0030_0000$$$::"Can't argue with that. I'll run and call you if anything happens."[lr]::
77237::$$$message_0719_0030_0001$$$::I ascend the steps.[lr]::
77238::$$$message_0719_0030_0002$$$::Saber remains alone under the cold winter sky as I enter the church.::
77239::$$$message_0719_0031_0000$$$::The priest is nowhere to be seen in the chapel.[lr]::
77240::$$$message_0719_0031_0001$$$::Instead, there's someone sitting in the pews.[lr]::
77241::$$$message_0719_0031_0002$$$::From behind, I can see blond hair.[lr]::
77242::$$$message_0719_0031_0003$$$::It must be a foreigner here to worship.::
77243::$$$message_0719_0032_0000$$$::"Excuse me. Is Father Kotomine here?"[lr]::
77244::$$$message_0719_0032_0001$$$::I try asking anyway.::
77245::$$$message_0719_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77246::$$$message_0719_0033_0001$$$::The figure lazily stands.[lr]::
77247::$$$message_0719_0033_0002$$$::Just from a glance, I can tell that his movements[lr]::
77248::$$$message_0719_0033_0003$$$::are firm and strong.::
77249::$$$message_0719_0034_0000$$$::He walks my way.[lr]::
77250::$$$message_0719_0034_0001$$$::There's nothing strange about how he moves, yet there's something I can't put my finger on.[lr]::
77251::$$$message_0719_0034_0002$$$::The man approaches me nonchalantly.[lr]::
77252::$$$message_0719_0034_0003$$$::But then...why do I feel like I'm about to fight for my life?::
77253::$$$message_0719_0035_0000$$$::"Ah[line2]"[lr]::
77254::$$$message_0719_0035_0001$$$::The man raises his hand.[lr]::
77255::$$$message_0719_0035_0002$$$::As I freeze stiff, he slowly reaches for my neck...[lr]::
77256::$$$message_0719_0035_0003$$$::...but his hand stops in midair.::
77257::$$$message_0719_0036_0000$$$::"...Oh? [font italic=true]Something[font italic=false] rather unsavory has developed an attraction to you."[lr]::
77258::$$$message_0719_0036_0001$$$::The man moves to leave.[lr]::
77259::$$$message_0719_0036_0002$$$::I can't say he's wrong.[lr]::
77260::$$$message_0719_0036_0003$$$::It'd be strange to say otherwise when I was in fear for my life simply because someone walked up to me.::
77261::$$$message_0719_0037_0000$$$::"Wait there. You seek Kotomine, yes?"[lr]::
77262::$$$message_0719_0037_0001$$$::The man disappears behind the altar.::
77263::$$$message_0719_0038_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
77264::$$$message_0719_0038_0001$$$::After waiting a few minutes...[lr]::
77265::$$$message_0719_0038_0002$$$::"I'm surprised. To think you'd retire after only half a day, Shirou Emiya."[lr]::
77266::$$$message_0719_0038_0003$$$::Father Kotomine appears and greets me in his usual unpleasant tone.::
77267::$$$message_0719_0039_0000$$$::"I don't intend to. I'm just here to ask you a question. Like I'd come just for the reasons you gave."[lr]::
77268::$$$message_0719_0039_0001$$$::"That is fine with me. I'm a busy man as well, so I wouldn't want you becoming dependent."::
77269::$$$message_0719_0040_0000$$$::Kotomine approaches, his hard footsteps echoing.[lr]::
77270::$$$message_0719_0040_0001$$$::...It's like there's an invisible pressure emanating from him.[lr]::
77271::$$$message_0719_0040_0002$$$::He gives off a severe air that makes me feel conscious of my flaws just by standing near him.[lr]::
77272::$$$message_0719_0040_0003$$$::Maybe it's a helpful trait for someone in his position...though at the same time, isn't that counterproductive for a priest?::
77273::$$$message_0719_0041_0000$$$::"And? State your question. We're hardly acquainted such that I feel a need to exchange pleasantries."[lr]::
77274::$$$message_0719_0041_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
77275::$$$message_0719_0042_0000$$$::...That's right.[lr]::
77276::$$$message_0719_0042_0001$$$::I don't need to be friends with this man.[lr]::
77277::$$$message_0719_0042_0002$$$::I'm only here to verify what Saber told me.[lr]::
77278::$$$message_0719_0042_0003$$$::Once I do that, I can get out of here and say good riddance.::
77279::$$$message_0719_0043_0000$$$::"Just one question. Why didn't you tell me?"[lr]::
77280::$$$message_0719_0043_0001$$$::"And what would you be referring to?"[lr]::
77281::$$$message_0719_0043_0002$$$::"About my old man. Why didn't you say that Kiritsugu Emiya was a Master in the last Holy Grail War?"[lr]::
77282::$$$message_0719_0043_0003$$$::The priest doesn't show a hint of shame. In fact, he looks like he's enjoying hearing me say Kiritsugu's name.::
77283::$$$message_0719_0044_0000$$$::"Answer me. If you're the overseer of this war, then you ought to know. Why didn't you tell me?"::
77284::$$$message_0719_0045_0000$$$::"There was hardly any reason to. How would knowing that your father was a Master benefit you? Kiritsugu Emiya's deeds are irrelevant to Shirou Emiya."::
77285::$$$message_0719_0046_0000$$$::What he says makes sense.[lr]::
77286::$$$message_0719_0046_0001$$$::Even if the old man was an excellent Master, it wouldn't do me any good to know it.[lr]::
77287::$$$message_0719_0046_0002$$$::But...::
77288::$$$message_0719_0047_0000$$$::"No, it [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] my business. Did I become a Master because I'm Kiritsugu's son?"[lr]::
77289::$$$message_0719_0047_0001$$$::Kiritsugu raised me as his son and trained me in magecraft as his apprentice.[lr]::
77290::$$$message_0719_0047_0002$$$::I became a Master just like him and made a contract with Saber, the exact same Heroic Spirit. Anyone would draw the obvious connection.::
77291::$$$message_0719_0048_0000$$$::"You said it's a coincidence that I became a Master.[lr]::
77292::$$$message_0719_0048_0001$$$::But if you had told me about Kiritsugu, then I would willingly fight in the war, just like you want. Why didn't you mention it?"::
77293::$$$message_0719_0049_0000$$$::"That is beyond my ability to know.[lr]::
77294::$$$message_0719_0049_0001$$$::I know of no genetic succession of Masterhood, and to begin with, you aren't Kiritsugu's blood-related son.[lr]::
77295::$$$message_0719_0049_0002$$$::It is very rare for a human with no intent or preparation to be chosen as a Master."::
77296::$$$message_0719_0050_0000$$$::"Normally, the Command Spells would not be bestowed upon someone who is ignorant of the Holy Grail, even if he is a mage. I don't know why an exception like you would occur."::
77297::$$$message_0719_0051_0000$$$::"...Then, it has nothing to do with my father?[lr]::
77298::$$$message_0719_0051_0001$$$::You're saying it's a coincidence that I became a Master, and that he saved me back then out of..."[lr]::
77299::$$$message_0719_0051_0002$$$::...sheer goodwill, because he wanted to save a dying child?::
77300::$$$message_0719_0052_0000$$$::"As far as I know. But I cannot divine the will of the Holy Grail. As much as I'd like to dismiss your selection as random chance, I feel some karmic connection at work.[lr]::
77301::$$$message_0719_0052_0001$$$::Perhaps the Holy Grail chose Kiritsugu Emiya's son to demand atonement for his rejection of the grail."::
77302::$$$message_0719_0053_0000$$$::"Wha... My old man...rejected the grail?"[lr]::
77303::$$$message_0719_0053_0001$$$::"Yes. Your father came to this town to obtain the Holy Grail.[lr]::
77304::$$$message_0719_0053_0002$$$::It was his sole objective. The grail responded to that pure wish. Perhaps it was willing to allow itself to fall into his hands."::
77305::$$$message_0719_0054_0000$$$::"But Kiritsugu betrayed the grail.[lr]::
77306::$$$message_0719_0054_0001$$$::In the last possible moment, he destroyed it. He turned on his own wish, on the grail's expectations, in order to end the Holy Grail War."::
77307::$$$message_0719_0055_0000$$$::"He...destroyed it...?"[lr]::
77308::$$$message_0719_0055_0001$$$::If that's true, then the Holy Grail certainly wouldn't approve.::
77309::$$$message_0719_0056_0000$$$::But it was the right thing to do.[lr]::
77310::$$$message_0719_0056_0001$$$::A Holy Grail that can grant any wish.[lr]::
77311::$$$message_0719_0056_0002$$$::Mages fighting over it to acquire that power.[lr]::
77312::$$$message_0719_0056_0003$$$::...If you think about it, the grail is the cause of all the fighting.[lr]::
77313::$$$message_0719_0056_0004$$$::The old man didn't betray anything by destroying it.[lr]::
77314::$$$message_0719_0056_0005$$$::Kiritsugu ended the war by staying true to himself and doing the right thing, by being the champion of justice I've always looked up to.::
77315::$$$message_0719_0057_0000$$$::"...That isn't treachery. I bet Kiritsugu destroyed the Holy Grail because he realized he didn't need it. He didn't betray anything."::
77316::$$$message_0719_0058_0000$$$::"Hm. That's right, you didn't know the man as he was.[lr]::
77317::$$$message_0719_0058_0001$$$::...Very well. Perhaps this is a waste of time, but I will tell you who that man truly was."[lr]::
77318::$$$message_0719_0058_0002$$$::The priest's lips curl.[lr]::
77319::$$$message_0719_0058_0003$$$::It's a repulsive smile, as if he's savoring the moment.::
77320::$$$message_0719_0059_0000$$$::"Kiritsugu Emiya.[lr]::
77321::$$$message_0719_0059_0001$$$::He was a mage whose life had nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. He simply lived according to his own desire and objectives, which eventually led him to seek out the grail.[lr]::

77331::$$$message_0719_0063_0000$$$::"They taught him[line2]a heretic[line2]knowledge of the Holy Grail, gave him the powers of a Master, and had him join with their bloodline in order to produce an even more battle-worthy heir.[lr]::

He felt neither pride in his own dominance nor guilt for the fallen."::

77346::$$$message_0719_0068_0003$$$::It was both his greatest strength and vulnerability. He severed his own feelings for the sake of his goals. Not through magical self-suggestion, mind you, but by relying on his own willpower.[lr]::
77347::$$$message_0719_0068_0004$$$::One so easily changed by magical suggestion or merely hardening their heart would not have been worthy of obtaining the grail. That must have been his belief. So he adopted the identity of a killer through and through.::

77483::$$$message_0719_0123_0000$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
77484::$$$message_0719_0123_0001$$$::...No, there's something else I need to be sure of.[lr]::
77485::$$$message_0719_0123_0002$$$::Didn't I come back to this church to clear away one of my doubts? It wasn't to ask how I should conduct myself as a Master.::
77486::$$$message_0719_0124_0000$$$::"Is it not about the Einzberns?[lr]::
77487::$$$message_0719_0124_0001$$$::As Kiritsugu's son, I believe they would consider you a target to be killed."::
77488::$$$message_0719_0125_0000$$$::"...! Right, that's it! Who the hell are these Einzbern people? You mentioned that they're the ones behind the Holy Grail War."::
77489::$$$message_0719_0126_0000$$$::"Yes, they are. I said that the Holy Grail War is a ritual. Accordingly, someone must have first designed it."::
77490::$$$message_0719_0127_0000$$$::"Two hundred years ago, there was a group of mages who learned of a distortion in this land's leylines. They shared their secrets with each other and built a circle deep within the land to activate the Holy Grail.[lr]::
77491::$$$message_0719_0127_0001$$$::This was the starting point of the Holy Grail War. The three families who were involved in creating the activation ritual are the formal owners of the grail."::
77492::$$$message_0719_0128_0000$$$::"Those who created the Holy Grail. Those who conceived the Command Spells with which to bind Heroic Spirits to their will. Those who provided the land and the ritual to open a path leading beyond the world."::
77493::$$$message_0719_0129_0000$$$::"The Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka families.[lr]::
77494::$$$message_0719_0129_0001$$$::The three founding families boast history and bloodlines the likes of which you and I can only dream of. Of them only the Tohsakas are natives of this land, but their grandmaster is the famed Schweinorg. If he is truly as capable as the stories say, then it is little wonder that their excellence has persisted in spite of mixed ancestry."::
77495::$$$message_0719_0130_0000$$$::"...Mmm. So these Einzberns are the top dogs of the war?"::
77496::$$$message_0719_0131_0000$$$::"In the past. But they have failed to summon the grail and they've been reduced to mere participants like the rest.[lr]::
77497::$$$message_0719_0131_0001$$$::Their current role is only to create a vessel for the Holy Grail.[lr]::
77498::$$$message_0719_0131_0002$$$::That goes for the Makiris and Tohsakas as well. They are now simply privileged families who are more likely to be chosen as Masters."::
77499::$$$message_0719_0132_0000$$$::"...That said, the Einzberns originally conceived this Holy Grail. They have a thousand years of history. Few mage lineages have persisted for a millennium without fragmenting their bloodlines."::
77500::$$$message_0719_0133_0000$$$::"Do you understand, Shirou Emiya? For a thousand years, the Einzberns have tirelessly pursued the Holy Grail.[lr]::
77501::$$$message_0719_0133_0001$$$::[font italic=true]One thousand years.[font italic=false] In the name of their quest, they have killed and killed and killed, committing atrocities beyond imagination, clinging to their inhuman madness since the Middle Ages.[lr]::
77502::$$$message_0719_0133_0002$$$::It is not passion, obsession, nor zealotry that inspires them, but a cross they desperately cling to in the name of reaching a pointless destination."::
77503::$$$message_0719_0134_0000$$$::"The Einzbern mages have gone beyond the realm of mere evil. Over the centuries, those monsters have never once strayed from their dogged pursuit of a shared goal that was forgotten only decades from its inception.[lr]::
77504::$$$message_0719_0134_0001$$$::We cannot imagine the obsession that drove them to endure the frustration and humiliation of inviting a foreign mage into their fold."::
77505::$$$message_0719_0135_0000$$$::"And yet, they have continued to prioritize attaining the Holy Grail.[lr]::
77506::$$$message_0719_0135_0001$$$::Five centuries of repeated mistakes: three spent thinking that they could not acquire the Grail on their own,[lr]::
77507::$$$message_0719_0135_0002$$$::and another two to realize that they could only acquire it via their own power."::
77508::$$$message_0719_0136_0000$$$::"The Einzberns were prepared to literally die for their own goal, and partnered with the two lesser houses to achieve it.[lr]::
77509::$$$message_0719_0136_0001$$$::As a result: they lost claim of ownership over the Holy Grail and were reduced to fighting their rivals for it. They bore that humiliation and even invited an outsider to contaminate their lineage. Then, when that man was within arm's reach of the prize, he betrayed his benefactors."::
77510::$$$message_0719_0137_0000$$$::"Such is the relationship between the Einzberns and Kiritsugu Emiya.[lr]::
77511::$$$message_0719_0137_0001$$$::And the sins of the father underpin your relationship with them."::
77512::$$$message_0719_0138_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
77513::$$$message_0719_0138_0001$$$::...Oh.[lr]::
77514::$$$message_0719_0138_0002$$$::No wonder she went straight for me.[lr]::
77515::$$$message_0719_0138_0003$$$::The son of the man who betrayed them is a Master. They'd never let me get away with that.::
77516::$$$message_0719_0139_0000$$$::"You seem to understand. While all Masters have some connection to this matter, the obsession of the Makiris and Einzberns cannot be described in mere words. The Makiris have chased it for five hundred years; the Einzberns, a thousand.[lr]::
77517::$$$message_0719_0139_0001$$$::If rightful ownership is the point of contention, then it will only be resolved once the Holy Grail falls into either of their hands."::
77518::$$$message_0719_0140_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
77519::$$$message_0719_0140_0001$$$::I have no words.[lr]::
77520::$$$message_0719_0140_0002$$$::Not just anyone can obsess over a single goal for hundreds of years.::
77521::$$$message_0719_0141_0000$$$::"Don't look so downtrodden. Kiritsugu Emiya may have betrayed the Einzberns, but it was not out of malice.[lr]::
77522::$$$message_0719_0141_0001$$$::On the contrary, he was so committed to his own wish that he was willing to defy thousand-year-old ghosts.[lr]::
77523::$$$message_0719_0141_0002$$$::To that end, he cast aside all that was near and dear to him.[lr]::
77524::$$$message_0719_0141_0003$$$::Is that not something to be proud of?"::
77525::$$$message_0719_0142_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77526::$$$message_0719_0142_0001$$$::...They welcomed him into their family.[lr]::
77527::$$$message_0719_0142_0002$$$::But he was so determined, he made an enemy out of one thousand years of history.[lr]::
77528::$$$message_0719_0142_0003$$$::I don't intend to take the priest's words at face value, but if it's true...[lr]::
77529::$$$message_0719_0142_0004$$$::   If I call myself my father's son, then I have to walk a path I believe in, just like he did...::
77530::$$$message_0719_0143_0000$$$::"What's the matter? Has the mention of a thousand years worn away your will to fight, Shirou Emiya?"::
77531::$$$message_0719_0144_0000$$$::"Yeah, right. No matter the story behind this war, I've made up my mind. Whatever the other Masters are planning, I won't let them repeat what happened ten years ago."[lr]::
77532::$$$message_0719_0144_0001$$$::I look up at him to drive the point home.[lr]::
77533::$$$message_0719_0144_0002$$$::The priest makes a dramatic, satisfied nod.::
77534::$$$message_0719_0145_0000$$$::"That is sufficient. If that is what drives you, then fight like your life depends on it. The longer it lasts, the more victims there will be. Do as Kiritsugu did and weigh lives on a balance, all to lure out your objective."::
77535::$$$message_0719_0146_0000$$$::"...You make it sound like it isn't your problem. Like you're telling me to be bait."::
77536::$$$message_0719_0147_0000$$$::"You have nothing else to offer as collateral, after all.[lr]::
77537::$$$message_0719_0147_0001$$$::I wouldn't call it a desperate measure. You lack the ability to detect other Masters, but Servants can sense other Servants. If you possess a capable Servant, then you need only wait for it to find the others."::
77538::$$$message_0719_0148_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
77539::$$$message_0719_0148_0001$$$::The priest turns his back on me.[lr]::
77540::$$$message_0719_0148_0002$$$::I have nothing else to ask him.[lr]::
77541::$$$message_0719_0148_0003$$$::Saber's been waiting a long time, so I should get back to her.::
77542::$$$message_0719_0149_0000$$$::"Wait. Now I have a question for you. Are you trained in healing magecraft?"[lr]::
77543::$$$message_0719_0149_0001$$$::"No. So what?"::
77544::$$$message_0719_0150_0000$$$::"In that case, you should bring me your wounded.[lr]::
77545::$$$message_0719_0150_0001$$$::The Church mustn't overlook any victims. I will treat them, if you can bring them here in time."[lr]::

77547::$$$message_0719_0150_0003$$$::I come to an abrupt halt on my way to the door.::

77549::$$$message_0719_0152_0000$$$::"It has never been my specialty, but I picked up the skill at some point.[lr]::
77550::$$$message_0719_0152_0001$$$::Long ago, I watched someone die of illness. It spurred me to try my hand at healing, and I had a greater knack for it than I expected."::
77551::$$$message_0719_0153_0000$$$::"Ah, but I will require compensation from you personally. As the overseer, I must treat my flock equally."[lr]::
77552::$$$message_0719_0153_0001$$$::"No thanks. I wouldn't come to you for help even if my life depended on it."[lr]::
77553::$$$message_0719_0153_0002$$$::I turn away in a huff, and don't stop walking until I'm outside.::
