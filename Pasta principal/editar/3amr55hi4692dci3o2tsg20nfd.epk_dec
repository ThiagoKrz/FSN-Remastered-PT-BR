58319::$$$message_0522_0000_0000$$$::    I should go check on her.[lr]::
58320::$$$message_0522_0000_0001$$$::If Saber's right, then this is no time to worry about embarrassing myself.::
58321::$$$message_0522_0001_0000$$$::"Sakura."[lr]::
58322::$$$message_0522_0001_0001$$$::I call her name through the door.[lr]::
58323::$$$message_0522_0001_0002$$$::There's no reply from the dressing room.[lr]::
58324::$$$message_0522_0001_0003$$$::In fact, it doesn't even sound like anyone's inside.::
58325::$$$message_0522_0002_0000$$$::"Sakura...? Hey, are you in there?"[lr]::
58326::$$$message_0522_0002_0001$$$::I knock on the door.[lr]::
58327::$$$message_0522_0002_0002$$$::Softly at first, then more vigorously, until I'm literally pounding on the door.::
58328::$$$message_0522_0003_0000$$$::"Sakura! Hey, say something if you're in there!"[lr]::
58329::$$$message_0522_0003_0001$$$::My anxiety turns into certainty.[lr]::
58330::$$$message_0522_0003_0002$$$::Something's wrong.[lr]::
58331::$$$message_0522_0003_0003$$$::I can't go in there, so maybe I should go get Fuji-nee or Saber to look in on her[line2]::
58332::$$$message_0522_0004_0000$$$::"Huh? O-oh, Senpai? Why are you so worked up?"[lr]::
58333::$$$message_0522_0004_0001$$$::"S-Sakura!? Uh, it's nothing. You took a while, so I was wondering what happened."::
58334::$$$message_0522_0005_0000$$$::"That's odd. Was I in there for such a long time?"[lr]::
58335::$$$message_0522_0005_0001$$$::"...?"[lr]::
58336::$$$message_0522_0005_0002$$$::Sakura sounds kind of hazy.[lr]::
58337::$$$message_0522_0005_0003$$$::Like she's weak, or unsteady on her feet, or like she just woke up from a nap.::
58338::$$$message_0522_0006_0000$$$::"Sakura... Don't tell me..."[lr]::
58339::$$$message_0522_0006_0001$$$::"...Yes. It was very nice, so I took a short nap..."[lr]::
58340::$$$message_0522_0006_0002$$$::"S-silly. Don't scare me like that, seriously."[lr]::
58341::$$$message_0522_0006_0003$$$::I slowly sink to my knees.::
58342::$$$message_0522_0007_0000$$$::"...I'm sorry. I'll be right out."[lr]::
58343::$$$message_0522_0007_0001$$$::"You do that... You'll catch a cold if you sleep in the bath, you know."::
58344::$$$message_0522_0008_0000$$$::I sigh and lean against the wall.[lr]::
58345::$$$message_0522_0008_0001$$$::...I feel silly for being so worried, but I'm glad she's fine.[lr]::
58346::$$$message_0522_0008_0002$$$::Sakura should feel better after a bath and a good night's sleep.::
58347::$$$message_0522_0009_0000$$$::"What was that?"[lr]::
58348::$$$message_0522_0009_0001$$$::I hear the sound of something heavy falling.[lr]::
58349::$$$message_0522_0009_0002$$$::It definitely came from the other side of the door.::
58350::$$$message_0522_0010_0000$$$::"Sakura!?"[lr]::
58351::$$$message_0522_0010_0001$$$::She doesn't respond.[lr]::
58352::$$$message_0522_0010_0002$$$::There isn't the feeling of someone on the other side of the door like there was earlier.::
58353::$$$message_0522_0011_0000$$$::"Ngh! I'm coming in, Sakura!"[lr]::
58354::$$$message_0522_0011_0001$$$::I run into the dressing room.[lr]::
58355::$$$message_0522_0011_0002$$$::Sakura's lying on the ground, spiritless.::
58356::$$$message_0522_0012_0000$$$::"Sakura! Sakura!"[lr]::
58357::$$$message_0522_0012_0001$$$::I lift her limp body off the ground.[lr]::
58358::$$$message_0522_0012_0002$$$::She's soft under my fingers, and warmer than I expected.::
58359::$$$message_0522_0013_0000$$$::"Ah. Mm...ngh..."[lr]::
58360::$$$message_0522_0013_0001$$$::Sakura doesn't seem conscious, but her breathing is labored.[lr]::
58361::$$$message_0522_0013_0002$$$::Her hands are clutched to her chest, as if trying to pry off something stuck to her skin.::
58362::$$$message_0522_0014_0000$$$::"Hah...ah...ah..."[lr]::
58363::$$$message_0522_0014_0001$$$::Pained whimpers.[lr]::
58364::$$$message_0522_0014_0002$$$::...This isn't eye candy.[lr]::
58365::$$$message_0522_0014_0003$$$::The softness of her body I'm carrying, and her disheveled hair.[lr]::
58366::$$$message_0522_0014_0004$$$::Wearing only a single shirt, this Sakura isn't the Sakura I know.::
58367::$$$message_0522_0015_0000$$$::The shirt emphasizes her abundant chest, and I can't tear my eyes away.[lr]::
58368::$$$message_0522_0015_0001$$$::Each heated sigh lifts her chest up and down, exposing her pearly neck.::
58369::$$$message_0522_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58370::$$$message_0522_0016_0001$$$::My heart almost jumps into my throat.::
58371::$$$message_0522_0017_0000$$$::"Ah...Mm, mm..."[lr]::
58372::$$$message_0522_0017_0001$$$::Her distressed lips, seeking oxygen, make my head spin.[lr]::
58373::$$$message_0522_0017_0002$$$::The body I'm holding is so hot, soft, and unbelievably charming.::
58374::$$$message_0522_0018_0000$$$::    My mind goes blank.[lr]::
58375::$$$message_0522_0018_0001$$$::I'm not holding a girl in my arms, but a plenty matured woman.[lr]::
58376::$$$message_0522_0018_0002$$$::This isn't the Sakura I know.[lr]::
58377::$$$message_0522_0018_0003$$$::Then...if I let the dizziness take over and hold her close...::
58378::$$$message_0522_0019_0000$$$::"Nngh! Damn it, what the hell is wrong with me!?"[lr]::
58379::$$$message_0522_0019_0001$$$::I shake my head.[lr]::
58380::$$$message_0522_0019_0002$$$::This isn't the time.[lr]::
58381::$$$message_0522_0019_0003$$$::Sakura's fever isn't normal. [lr]::
58382::$$$message_0522_0019_0004$$$::Above all, her fingers clutching painfully at her chest show that this is more than simple anemia.::
58383::$$$message_0522_0020_0000$$$::"Sakura! Get it together, Sakura!"[lr]::
58384::$$$message_0522_0020_0001$$$::I yell into her ear.[lr]::
58385::$$$message_0522_0020_0002$$$::"Ah...Huah..."[lr]::
58386::$$$message_0522_0020_0003$$$::The hair stuck to her cheek falls free.[lr]::
58387::$$$message_0522_0020_0004$$$::Sakura slowly blinks her eyes open and looks up at me.::
58388::$$$message_0522_0021_0000$$$::"Huh? Senpai...? What are you doing here...?"[lr]::
58389::$$$message_0522_0021_0001$$$::"Idiot, should you really be asking that!? You should have told me if you had a fever!"[lr]::
58390::$$$message_0522_0021_0002$$$::"Eh...? I have...a fever?"::
58391::$$$message_0522_0022_0000$$$::"Who else would I be talking about!? Just touch your forehead! It's really hot!"[lr]::
58392::$$$message_0522_0022_0001$$$::"Huh...but it doesn't feel that warm to me..."[lr]::
58393::$$$message_0522_0022_0002$$$::Sakura murmurs dreamily. Maybe she's still half-asleep.::
58394::$$$message_0522_0023_0000$$$::"Just...just stay still! I'll take you to your bed!"[lr]::
58395::$$$message_0522_0023_0001$$$::"Kyah!? Senpai, what are you doing!?"[lr]::
58396::$$$message_0522_0023_0002$$$::"Taking you to your room. Lemme warn you now, don't make a fuss. I'm not sure I can hold it together anymore."[lr]::
58397::$$$message_0522_0023_0003$$$::I go into the hallway, carrying Sakura.::
58398::$$$message_0522_0024_0000$$$::"Wah...! S-S-Senpai, you're carrying me!?"[lr]::
58399::$$$message_0522_0024_0001$$$::Sakura wraps her arms tightly around my neck in surprise.::
58400::$$$message_0522_0025_0000$$$::"Mngh."[lr]::
58401::$$$message_0522_0025_0001$$$::Her ch-chest is incredibly bouncy and touching me but I'm going to ignore that right now!::
58402::$$$message_0522_0026_0000$$$::Speed is of the essence.[lr]::
58403::$$$message_0522_0026_0001$$$::Before my sanity gives out, I need to carry Sakura to the guestroom as fast as I can!::
58404::$$$message_0522_0027_0000$$$::"Your fever's a tad over 37 degrees. Huh. That's lower than I expected."[lr]::
58405::$$$message_0522_0027_0001$$$::I shake the thermometer and look at Sakura, who's lying in bed.::
58406::$$$message_0522_0028_0000$$$::"I'm sorry... I must have gotten dizzy after getting into the bath in such a nervous state."[lr]::
58407::$$$message_0522_0028_0001$$$::Sakura guiltily hides her face under the covers.::
58408::$$$message_0522_0029_0000$$$::"Well, there's no helping the fact that you're sick. A cold like this should heal with medicine and some rest, so try and take it easy for tonight.[lr]::
58409::$$$message_0522_0029_0001$$$::I'll leave water on this chair. Try not to go outside, all right? You'll get a chill."[lr]::
58410::$$$message_0522_0029_0002$$$::Just in case, I put on another blanket over her and turn off the lights.::
58411::$$$message_0522_0030_0000$$$::"See ya tomorrow. I'll come wake you up, so take it easy."[lr]::
58412::$$$message_0522_0030_0001$$$::I give Sakura an affectionate pat on the head and make for the door.[lr]::
58413::$$$message_0522_0030_0002$$$::But then...[lr]::
58414::$$$message_0522_0030_0003$$$::Something tugs on me from behind.[lr]::
58415::$$$message_0522_0030_0004$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
58416::$$$message_0522_0030_0005$$$::When I turn to look, there's something clutching my shirt sleeve.::
58417::$$$message_0522_0031_0000$$$::"Sakura...? Sorry, I can't leave because you're holding on to me."[lr]::
58418::$$$message_0522_0031_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
58419::$$$message_0522_0031_0002$$$::Sakura withdraws her hand in surprise, as if she just noticed.::
58420::$$$message_0522_0032_0000$$$::"I-I'm so sorry, Senpai! I must be dizzy from the fever, and...!"[lr]::
58421::$$$message_0522_0032_0001$$$::Sakura jumps out of bed and frantically apologizes.[lr]::
58422::$$$message_0522_0032_0002$$$::I can tell how red her face is even with the lights off.::
58423::$$$message_0522_0033_0000$$$::"Sakura, are you scared?"[lr]::
58424::$$$message_0522_0033_0001$$$::"...Yes. I'm afraid of sleeping alone in a place I don't know."[lr]::
58425::$$$message_0522_0033_0002$$$::I can't see Sakura's expression. Her long hair hides her face.[lr]::
58426::$$$message_0522_0033_0003$$$::...But from the side, her profile reminds me of that withdrawn girl I first met years ago.::
58427::$$$message_0522_0034_0000$$$::"...I see. You must feel anxious, catching a cold and then using someone else's room for the first time."[lr]::
58428::$$$message_0522_0034_0001$$$::I sit down on the bed.[lr]::
58429::$$$message_0522_0034_0002$$$::Then, I lie down on my back.[lr]::
58430::$$$message_0522_0034_0003$$$::I can't quite bring myself to face Sakura while doing it, but this is good enough.::
58431::$$$message_0522_0035_0000$$$::"U-um, Senpai?"[lr]::
58432::$$$message_0522_0035_0001$$$::"I'll stay a little longer. That'll help you get used to the room. I'll leave once you fall asleep.[lr]::
58433::$$$message_0522_0035_0002$$$::To be honest, I'm worried you're forcing yourself to do this. I'll keep an eye on you for another thirty minutes, so lie back down."[lr]::
58434::$$$message_0522_0035_0003$$$::I gesture to her spot on the bed without facing her.::
58435::$$$message_0522_0036_0000$$$::"...All right. Then please stay with me a while longer, Senpai." ::
58436::$$$message_0522_0037_0000$$$::A soft breeze caresses my cheek.[lr]::
58437::$$$message_0522_0037_0001$$$::It must be the air displaced by Sakura pulling the covers back on.[lr]::
58438::$$$message_0522_0037_0002$$$::...I consider this a small price to pay for her peace of mind.[lr]::
58439::$$$message_0522_0037_0003$$$::It doesn't even begin to cover the interest on the debt I owe her for helping me so much.::
58440::$$$message_0522_0038_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58441::$$$message_0522_0038_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58442::$$$message_0522_0038_0002$$$::In the dark, all one can hear is the ticking of the clock.[lr]::
58443::$$$message_0522_0038_0003$$$::Whether it's because my back is to her, or because her profile is still in my mind,[lr]::
58444::$$$message_0522_0038_0004$$$::the feelings I had when I carried her earlier fade, and I quietly stare at the clock.[lr]::
58445::$$$message_0522_0038_0005$$$::...The rest of the time passes in silence, and anyone would guess that we'd both fallen asleep.::
58446::$$$message_0522_0039_0000$$$::"Senpai, are you awake?"[lr]::
58447::$$$message_0522_0039_0001$$$::I hear a gentle voice in the darkness.::
58448::$$$message_0522_0040_0000$$$::"Mm."[lr]::
58449::$$$message_0522_0040_0001$$$::I murmur an affirmative.[lr]::
58450::$$$message_0522_0040_0002$$$::Sakura takes a quiet breath, and continues.[lr]::
58451::$$$message_0522_0040_0003$$$::"...Okay. Thank you for today."[lr]::
58452::$$$message_0522_0040_0004$$$::Then, she drifts off to sleep.::
