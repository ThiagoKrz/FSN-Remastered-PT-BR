73170::$$$message_0670_0000_0000$$$::Last time was the final Tiger Dojo.[lr]::
73171::$$$message_0670_0000_0001$$$::You should go back to the title screen for your own good.::
73172::$$$message_0670_0000_0002$$$::EXTRA STAAAAAGE,::
73173::$$$message_0670_0000_0003$$$::SIDE A!!!::
73174::$$$message_0670_0000_0004$$$::How's everyone doing? Did ya hit a ruthless dead end?[lr]::
73175::$$$message_0670_0000_0005$$$::Welcome to Tiger Dojo Remixed, where we save you from your bad decisions in a lighthearted tone!::
73176::$$$message_0670_0000_0006$$$::Ossu! Our battle has just begun!::
73177::$$$message_0670_0000_0007$$$::Hey, don't say that. Lines like that go straight to the ending, so stop.::
73178::$$$message_0670_0000_0008$$$::Anyway, you're right before the climax of Sakura's route,[lr]::
73179::$$$message_0670_0000_0009$$$::which is no time to be dying right while Miss Tohsaka's in a pinch!::
73180::$$$message_0670_0000_0010$$$::Yeah! You can't beat Saber no matter what, Shirou, so trust Rider and focus on your own job!::
73181::$$$message_0670_0000_0011$$$::Mm-hm. Your job is rear-line support. Watch the duel from far away and steal the glory when the time's right!::
73182::$$$message_0670_0000_0012$$$::...But man, things have gotten pretty out of hand. The stage is underground, and Sakura got a hyper power-up.::
73183::$$$message_0670_0000_0013$$$::Whatever happened to "Fate"?::
73184::$$$message_0670_0000_0014$$$::Uuuu, yeah, Master. I thought this route would be my turn, but my rival was Sakura, you know?::
73185::$$$message_0670_0000_0015$$$::I couldn't compete with her at all, so I had to come back to the dojo. Boo-hoo...::
73186::$$$message_0670_0000_0016$$$::Aww, so tragic...::
73187::$$$message_0670_0000_0017$$$::So it's true that bullied kids really do come back the strongest... Those Tohsaka sisters are something to be feared. I didn't think both would turn out to be so devilish...::
73188::$$$message_0670_0000_0018$$$::Honestly, they all like to play so innocent.[lr]::
73189::$$$message_0670_0000_0019$$$::Saber's merciless once she goes dark, and Rin is pretty coldhearted when it comes down to it.::
73190::$$$message_0670_0000_0020$$$::I feel bad for Shirou. I'm the only heroine who isn't two-faced.::
73191::$$$message_0670_0000_0021$$$::...Well, it's true you don't have a hidden side.::
73192::$$$message_0670_0000_0022$$$::And now, it's time for a little tease, as tradition goes.[lr]::
73193::$$$message_0670_0000_0023$$$::Sakura's route, "Heaven's Feel", has two endings.::
73194::$$$message_0670_0000_0024$$$::One of them is the grand finale[lr]::
73195::$$$message_0670_0000_0025$$$::and the true ending to [font italic=true]Fate/stay night[font italic=false].::
73196::$$$message_0670_0000_0026$$$::True and Normal, right?::
73197::$$$message_0670_0000_0027$$$::I think Normal's pretty easy to get.[lr]::
73198::$$$message_0670_0000_0028$$$::But True depends on what you've accomplished so far.::
73199::$$$message_0670_0000_0029$$$::To be blunt, if my affection level is below 4 or you use too many Projections, you can't reach the True ending!::
73200::$$$message_0670_0000_0030$$$::CHESTOOOO! NO SPOILERS!::
73201::$$$message_0670_0000_0031$$$::Owwww... Come on, we're almost at the end, anyway!::
73202::$$$message_0670_0000_0032$$$::I said no! This is Fate's last bastion![lr]::
73203::$$$message_0670_0000_0033$$$::But yes, if you restart from Day 14, you should be able to fix Illya's affection level!::
73204::$$$message_0670_0000_0034$$$::Hey! How come you get to say it!?::
73205::$$$message_0670_0000_0035$$$::Huh? This is a Q&A, you know. We only exist to give the player hints.::
73206::$$$message_0670_0000_0036$$$::Uh-huh, okay. I don't know how that's different from a spoiler, but your house, your rules, Master.::
73207::$$$message_0670_0000_0037$$$::And I finally realized now that we're at the 39th episode!::
73208::$$$message_0670_0000_0038$$$::We're almost at the climax. The next Tiger Dojo will be the last.[lr]::
73209::$$$message_0670_0000_0039$$$::Our long story will finally come to an end.::
73210::$$$message_0670_0000_0040$$$::I heard that they went all out for the last Bad End in a sickly sweet, lovey-dovey side story![lr]::
73211::$$$message_0670_0000_0041$$$::Everyone, look forward to it and crush your indecision!::
