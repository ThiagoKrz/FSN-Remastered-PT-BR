75460::$$$message_0695_0000_0000$$$::The dark giant escaped from the castle with the little girl.[lr]::
75461::$$$message_0695_0000_0001$$$::It was an inexplicable flight.[lr]::
75462::$$$message_0695_0000_0002$$$::They left what would normally be the best possible defensive position and fled into the forest, where they're more vulnerable.::
75463::$$$message_0695_0001_0000$$$::    Danger was closing in.[lr]::
75464::$$$message_0695_0001_0001$$$::The girl sensed that unavoidable truth first.[lr]::
75465::$$$message_0695_0001_0002$$$::...The enemy is slowly approaching the castle.[lr]::
75466::$$$message_0695_0001_0003$$$::When she sensed how great the threat was, she raised the castle's defenses to maximum and woke up the giant in preparation for its arrival.[lr]::
75467::$$$message_0695_0001_0004$$$::Berserker, the dark giant with a steel-like body.[lr]::
75468::$$$message_0695_0001_0005$$$::Robbed of his sanity, he's been reduced to an avatar of destruction bent only on obeying the girl.::
75469::$$$message_0695_0002_0000$$$::With her bodyguard and defenses, she has no enemy to be afraid of.[lr]::
75470::$$$message_0695_0002_0001$$$::That's what she told herself as she tried to fight down the sense of inevitable dread.::
75471::$$$message_0695_0003_0000$$$::And yet...[lr]::
75472::$$$message_0695_0003_0001$$$::As soon as the enemy approached, the giant at her side told her: [lr]::
75473::$$$message_0695_0003_0002$$$::"Run."[lr]::
75474::$$$message_0695_0003_0003$$$::Robbed of his sanity and speech, even the mad warrior sensed that he couldn't win against whatever was coming for them.::
75475::$$$message_0695_0004_0000$$$::Instantly, the girl fled.[lr]::
75476::$$$message_0695_0004_0001$$$::She knows.[lr]::
75477::$$$message_0695_0004_0002$$$::She knew.[lr]::
75478::$$$message_0695_0004_0003$$$::There is nothing they can do against the thing at the castle walls.[lr]::
75479::$$$message_0695_0004_0004$$$::With the sun behind it, the ominous Shadow expanded until it became large enough to easily scale the walls.::
75480::$$$message_0695_0005_0000$$$::    They would lose.[lr]::
75481::$$$message_0695_0005_0001$$$::Berserker can't win against it, to say nothing of herself.[lr]::
75482::$$$message_0695_0005_0002$$$::If they fight it, they're sure to lose, and Berserker won't be her Servant anymore.[lr]::
75483::$$$message_0695_0005_0003$$$::That's the source of her unease.[lr]::
75484::$$$message_0695_0005_0004$$$::The girl ran because she was afraid of losing her Servant, not losing the fight.::
75485::$$$message_0695_0006_0000$$$::With the girl in his arms, the dark giant races through the forest.[lr]::
75486::$$$message_0695_0006_0001$$$::Her apprehension weighs on her even more heavily.[lr]::
75487::$$$message_0695_0006_0002$$$::   They can't escape.[lr]::
75488::$$$message_0695_0006_0003$$$::Vaguely realizing that there's no escape from this dread, from this fear, the girl orders the dark giant to stop.::
75489::$$$message_0695_0007_0000$$$::"Oh? How wise. Have you come forth because you know you cannot win?"::
75490::$$$message_0695_0008_0000$$$::Before her stands an old mage, wrinkled and old like a withered tree.[lr]::
75491::$$$message_0695_0008_0001$$$::Next to him stands an Assassin wearing a white skull mask.[lr]::
75492::$$$message_0695_0008_0002$$$::Zouken Matou.[lr]::
75493::$$$message_0695_0008_0003$$$::She recognizes him with a single look as a mage of the Makiris, whom she was taught about when she left the castle in her homeland.::
75494::$$$message_0695_0009_0000$$$::"Zouken Matou. You're playing at being a Master, even though the Holy Grail hasn't chosen you."[lr]::
75495::$$$message_0695_0009_0001$$$::The girl climbs down from the dark giant and faces the old man.[lr]::
75496::$$$message_0695_0009_0002$$$::There's no fear in her eyes.[lr]::
75497::$$$message_0695_0009_0003$$$::The threat that she and the giant felt is most certainly not the person in front of them.::
75498::$$$message_0695_0010_0000$$$::"The Holy Grail hasn't chosen me as a Master, you say? The Grail is but a receptacle. Why, you sound like you've let the Church poison your mind, to imply that it can consecrate others of its own will."::
75499::$$$message_0695_0011_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
75500::$$$message_0695_0011_0001$$$::The girl watches the old man coldly as he chuckles good in delight.[lr]::
75501::$$$message_0695_0011_0002$$$::...He's right. The Holy Grail does not choose.[lr]::
75502::$$$message_0695_0011_0003$$$::Masters are chosen by the Holy Grail, Servants are granted physical form by its power, and are anchored in the world by their Masters.[lr]::
75503::$$$message_0695_0011_0004$$$::That rule[line2]that pretext was deliberately distorted and spread.[lr]::
75504::$$$message_0695_0011_0005$$$::The girl knows that the goal of the Holy Grail War is just the opposite.::
75505::$$$message_0695_0012_0000$$$::It is merely to fill the Grail.[lr]::
75506::$$$message_0695_0012_0001$$$::The Masters are not chosen. They are merely components of a ritual.[lr]::
75507::$$$message_0695_0012_0002$$$::Likewise, Servants are merely used to open the gate...[r]::
75508::$$$message_0695_0013_0000$$$::"...Hmph. You're the one who's been poisoned by your delusions, Zouken.[lr]::
75509::$$$message_0695_0013_0001$$$::The vessel has no will of it own, but the Greater Grail which selects the Masters does. You summon Heroic Spirits to fill the Holy Grail because its prototype is here, on this land.[lr]::
75510::$$$message_0695_0013_0002$$$::...The Makiri bloodline really must have fallen into ruin, if even a founder has forgotten that."[lr]::
75511::$$$message_0695_0013_0003$$$::The girl's voice is cold.[lr]::
75512::$$$message_0695_0013_0004$$$::She shows nothing but scorn for him, and the old man accepts it with a chuckle.::
75513::$$$message_0695_0014_0000$$$::"My, my. There's no need for concern. The decline of the Makiris ends here. Our endeavor is nearly complete. I had planned to finish it in the next ritual, but I've been blessed with capable pawns. I'm only one step away from my long-cherished goal."[lr]::
75514::$$$message_0695_0014_0001$$$::"Really. Then do as you wish. I have no interest in you. I don't like the fact that there's another vessel out there besides me, but it'll fail, anyway. I won't stop you, so go crawl back into your hole."::
75515::$$$message_0695_0015_0000$$$::"That goes without saying. This old body of mine doesn't like the sunlight, so I'll go back to my nest once my business is done.[lr]::
75516::$$$message_0695_0015_0001$$$::But...I can't help but feel anxious when things go so smoothly. Just in case, I'll be taking your body, too. If I can seize you here, then my wish is all but granted."::
75517::$$$message_0695_0016_0000$$$::   The old man burns with a ghastly aura.[lr]::
75518::$$$message_0695_0016_0001$$$::The white skull slowly stands up, but stops, against the old man's wishes.[lr]::
75519::$$$message_0695_0016_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75520::$$$message_0695_0016_0003$$$::It's obvious with a glance.[lr]::
75521::$$$message_0695_0016_0004$$$::The white-masked Assassin is overwhelmed by the giant's presence.[lr]::
75522::$$$message_0695_0016_0005$$$::He has absolutely no chance of defeating it.[lr]::
75523::$$$message_0695_0016_0006$$$::He'll be cut in half in a single stroke if he attacks.[lr]::
75524::$$$message_0695_0016_0007$$$::So he stays still, knowing full well what awaits him.::
75525::$$$message_0695_0017_0000$$$::"Hmm. A coward, just like his Master. You shouldn't have come if you're so afraid of death. Do both of you value your own lives that much?"[lr]::
75526::$$$message_0695_0017_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75527::$$$message_0695_0017_0002$$$::Assassin doesn't answer.[lr]::
75528::$$$message_0695_0017_0003$$$::Instead, his Master laughs loudly.::
75529::$$$message_0695_0018_0000$$$::"Yes, I do! My wish is for immortality, and he desires a name that will be remembered for eternity. We were fated to meet because our goals are the same."[lr]::
75530::$$$message_0695_0018_0001$$$::"...Are you insane? You're going to wish for immortality?"[lr]::
75531::$$$message_0695_0018_0002$$$::The girl's eyes are filled with disgust.[lr]::
75532::$$$message_0695_0018_0003$$$::The old man's sneer twists even more.[lr]::
75533::$$$message_0695_0018_0004$$$::It's as if he was waiting for her criticism and scorn.::
75534::$$$message_0695_0019_0000$$$::"Naturally. Behold this body. With every passing moment, it loses its functions and reeks of death, melting from within. Even now, my brain cells wither and take my intellect with them.[lr]::
75535::$$$message_0695_0019_0001$$$::How could you possibly comprehend this pain, this suffering of a constantly crumbling life?"[lr]::
75536::$$$message_0695_0019_0002$$$::"...You brought that on yourself. The human body can barely last a hundred years. To go beyond that, you have to pay a price. If you can't endure it, then disappear. Death will end your suffering, you know."::
75537::$$$message_0695_0020_0000$$$::"...Ha."[lr]::
75538::$$$message_0695_0020_0001$$$::The old body trembles.[lr]::
75539::$$$message_0695_0020_0002$$$::The mage's back quivers as if he's having a coughing fit.[lr]::
75540::$$$message_0695_0020_0003$$$::"Haha, hahahahaha! There it is, Einzbern! The same old logic, even after a thousand years. In the end, you're nothing but puppets imitating humans! Hahahahaha...!"[lr]::
75541::$$$message_0695_0020_0004$$$::He chortles heartily, finding it truly hilarious.::
75542::$$$message_0695_0021_0000$$$::"...What did you say?"[lr]::
75543::$$$message_0695_0021_0001$$$::"Fool. Listen well, child of winter.[lr]::
75544::$$$message_0695_0021_0002$$$::For humans, there is no greater sorrow than death. Even the pain of being a nest for these worms is like the sting of a mosquito compared to my own death.[lr]::
75545::$$$message_0695_0021_0003$$$::Survival is the only true way to escape suffering. If one finds comfort in death, then it just proves that one was never truly alive at all.[lr]::
75546::$$$message_0695_0021_0004$$$::That is what makes you a mere puppet. Your hastily built body won't last another year. How can a creation designed to live a short life possibly comprehend human desire!?"::
75547::$$$message_0695_0022_0000$$$::"That's right, I can't understand it. You're an exception even among humans because you've failed to accept your own mortality even after such a long life. You're deranged.[lr]::
75548::$$$message_0695_0022_0001$$$::Do you really not want to die that badly?"::
75549::$$$message_0695_0023_0000$$$::"Of course. It's inconceivable. I don't want to die like this. I must remain in this world and live on. But I've reached the limit of what I can do. That is why I desire a permanent, eternal vessel.[lr]::
75550::$$$message_0695_0023_0001$$$::For that purpose..."[lr]::
75551::$$$message_0695_0023_0002$$$::"That's why you want the Holy Grail? You seek it because you fear death?"::
75552::$$$message_0695_0024_0000$$$::"Ha. What human does not fear death?[lr]::
75553::$$$message_0695_0024_0001$$$::It is futile to seek any truth or state of enlightenment. You cannot overcome your own extinction, or the end of the world.[lr]::
75554::$$$message_0695_0024_0002$$$::Know this. If there is any way to still live, then anyone would reach for it, even if it means sacrificing the entire world! That is what it means to be human...!"::
75555::$$$message_0695_0025_0000$$$::"Then you'd willingly sacrifice everyone else so that you can keep on living?"[lr]::
75556::$$$message_0695_0025_0001$$$::"Indeed. I would kill every last person on this earth, if it would make my wish come true.[lr]::
75557::$$$message_0695_0025_0002$$$::...Human greed knows no bounds.[lr]::
75558::$$$message_0695_0025_0003$$$::If you knew that each tree in this forest could be made into a drug to extend your life, even you would cut down the whole forest in an instant. Even if it only meant an extra day of life.[lr]::
75559::$$$message_0695_0025_0004$$$::You would kill a part of the world for one more day.[lr]::
75560::$$$message_0695_0025_0005$$$::And your desire would not be sated by a single forest. You would kill all the trees in the world."::
75561::$$$message_0695_0026_0000$$$::"It doesn't matter that the harvest would destroy the world for everyone else.[lr]::
75562::$$$message_0695_0026_0001$$$::Isn't that obvious? That is how humans have grown, increased, and grown fat throughout our history.[lr]::
75563::$$$message_0695_0026_0002$$$::I am merely following a law that governs us all. If we are all destined for ruin in the end, then who can criticize me for walking out of step with the masses...!?"::
75564::$$$message_0695_0027_0000$$$::The old man rants merrily.[lr]::
75565::$$$message_0695_0027_0001$$$::After staring at him for a moment in surprise...[lr]::
75566::$$$message_0695_0027_0002$$$::"I'm amazed. You've fallen so far, Makiri."[lr]::
75567::$$$message_0695_0027_0003$$$::The girl speaks in a voice very unlike that of a girl.::
75568::$$$message_0695_0028_0000$$$::"Wh...at?"[lr]::
75569::$$$message_0695_0028_0001$$$::"Remember. Where did our wish, our earnest hope to achieve a miracle, come from?[lr]::
75570::$$$message_0695_0028_0002$$$::For what reason did we insist on maintaining a human form while trying to reach a destination beyond the means of mankind?"::
75571::$$$message_0695_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75572::$$$message_0695_0029_0001$$$::The laughter dies.[lr]::
75573::$$$message_0695_0029_0002$$$::The old mage stares up at the sky in contemplation.[lr]::
75574::$$$message_0695_0029_0003$$$::"...Hmph. Well spoken for a puppet. I see they've programmed you to imitate Justeaze."[lr]::
75575::$$$message_0695_0029_0004$$$::He stares at the pale girl with a hideous expression.::
75576::$$$message_0695_0030_0000$$$::"Enough. Playtime is over. I want your body, but I have no use for your mind. I, Zouken Makiri, will take the Einzbern Grail."[lr]::
75577::$$$message_0695_0030_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
75578::$$$message_0695_0030_0002$$$::The old man's shadow creeps along the ground.[lr]::
75579::$$$message_0695_0030_0003$$$::...As if in response, the worrying pressure that had been hanging over the girl increases.::
75580::$$$message_0695_0031_0000$$$::"[wacky len=12]"[lr]::
75581::$$$message_0695_0031_0001$$$::The dark giant moves out without waiting for his Master's command.[lr]::
75582::$$$message_0695_0031_0002$$$::"No...! Come back, Berserker!"[lr]::
75583::$$$message_0695_0031_0003$$$::Her voice doesn't reach him.[lr]::
75584::$$$message_0695_0031_0004$$$::Kicking up a violent tempest, the dark giant storms in to mow down the encroaching Shadow...[r]::
H
