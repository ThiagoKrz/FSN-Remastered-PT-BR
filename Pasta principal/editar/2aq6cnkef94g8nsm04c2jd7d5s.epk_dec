76509::$$$message_0711_0001_0000$$$::I'm trapped in a steamy stone room.[lr]::
76510::$$$message_0711_0001_0001$$$::The heat seeping in from my shoulder joint is like thousands of microscopic bugs eating my cells.[lr]::
76511::$$$message_0711_0001_0002$$$::My shoulder. It's like countless bugs are gathering in a wound I can't see.::
76512::$$$message_0711_0002_0000$$$::      It's hot.::
76513::$$$message_0711_0003_0000$$$::My body burns from within.[lr]::
76514::$$$message_0711_0003_0001$$$::This is more like a frying pan with the lid on, than a sauna.[lr]::
76515::$$$message_0711_0003_0002$$$::There's a sizzling sound. If I relax, I might find myself burned black.::
76516::$$$message_0711_0004_0000$$$::          It's hot.::
76517::$$$message_0711_0005_0000$$$::The heat melts my mind, not my body.[lr]::
76518::$$$message_0711_0005_0001$$$::Oozing. Roaring.[lr]::
76519::$$$message_0711_0005_0002$$$::The heat spreads fiercely and cautiously, burning and rewriting my genes.[lr]::
76520::$$$message_0711_0005_0003$$$::...Will this nightmare finally end?::
76521::$$$message_0711_0006_0000$$$::            It's hot.::
76522::$$$message_0711_0007_0000$$$::The open hole is covered to stop the bugs from escaping.[lr]::

76527::$$$message_0711_0007_0005$$$::    It's hot hot hot hot...!!!::
76528::$$$message_0711_0008_0000$$$::The hole is my shoulder.[lr]::
76529::$$$message_0711_0008_0001$$$::Bugs barge into my body through that entrance.[lr]::
76530::$$$message_0711_0008_0002$$$::The entrance[line2]the hole they should leave through is blocked by flesh that isn't my own...!::
76531::$$$message_0711_0009_0000$$$::I'm changing.[lr]::
76532::$$$message_0711_0009_0001$$$::Something unknown is changing me.[lr]::
76533::$$$message_0711_0009_0002$$$::It's coming in.[lr]::
76534::$$$message_0711_0009_0003$$$::Knowledge I shouldn't have enters my brain.[lr]::
76535::$$$message_0711_0009_0004$$$::His combat experience and knowledge.::
76536::$$$message_0711_0010_0000$$$::"Hah...ah, gah...!"::
76537::$$$message_0711_0011_0000$$$::His Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
76538::$$$message_0711_0011_0001$$$::Not those short swords.[lr]::
76539::$$$message_0711_0011_0002$$$::Kanshou and Bakuya.[lr]::
76540::$$$message_0711_0011_0003$$$::He was a blacksmith Heroic Spirit who favored those swords also forged by a famous blacksmith.::
76541::$$$message_0711_0012_0000$$$::So he forged them, too.[lr]::
76542::$$$message_0711_0012_0001$$$::He could reproduce anything he saw and understood.[lr]::
76543::$$$message_0711_0012_0002$$$::No.[lr]::
76544::$$$message_0711_0012_0003$$$::It wasn't reproduction, but Projection[line2][lr]::
76545::$$$message_0711_0012_0004$$$::a unique type of magecraft that recreates the caster's imagined principle of creation.[lr]::
76546::$$$message_0711_0012_0005$$$::The heat burning my heart demands that I master it.::
76547::$$$message_0711_0013_0000$$$::"Hah... Ah, ahh...!"::
76548::$$$message_0711_0014_0000$$$::Are you kidding me? That's impossible. I can't let this inside me.[lr]::
76549::$$$message_0711_0014_0001$$$::I don't know Projection. I haven't reached that level yet.[lr]::
76550::$$$message_0711_0014_0002$$$::This shortcut is definitely going to destroy my body.[lr]::
76551::$$$message_0711_0014_0003$$$::I already have my hands full just being myself. I can't remember all this other stuff he's showing me, much less master it.[lr]::
76552::$$$message_0711_0014_0004$$$::I'm not strong enough to do it, you and I are complete strangers with nothing in common, so there's no way this will take. No, even if it does, I couldn't possibly endure it.[lr]::
76553::$$$message_0711_0014_0005$$$::Can't lose track of time, can't get out of order, even if you help me, I don't have the skill to handle it[line2][lr]::

76555::$$$message_0711_0014_0007$$$::...My consciousness slowly returns.[lr]::
76556::$$$message_0711_0014_0008$$$::I'm in an unfamiliar room, lying on an unfamiliar bed.::
76557::$$$message_0711_0015_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
76558::$$$message_0711_0015_0001$$$::I sit up.[lr]::
76559::$$$message_0711_0015_0002$$$::I think I...saw Saber in the forest, ran away with Tohsaka, and then I took Illya and...[lr]::
76560::$$$message_0711_0015_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
76561::$$$message_0711_0015_0004$$$::We lock eyes.[lr]::
76562::$$$message_0711_0015_0005$$$::Illya is right next to the bed, staring at me with wide eyes.::
76563::$$$message_0711_0016_0000$$$::"...Oh. You're okay, Illya."[lr]::
76564::$$$message_0711_0016_0001$$$::I sigh in relief.[lr]::
76565::$$$message_0711_0016_0002$$$::I don't know what's going on yet, but I'm really happy that Illya is all right.::
76566::$$$message_0711_0017_0000$$$::"It worked! You're awake, Shirou!"[lr]::
76567::$$$message_0711_0017_0001$$$::"Huh? Wait, Illya...!"[lr]::
76568::$$$message_0711_0017_0002$$$::Illya dives into my arms.::
76569::$$$message_0711_0018_0000$$$::"Oof."[lr]::
76570::$$$message_0711_0018_0001$$$::"Thank goodness... Thank goodness, Shirou...!"[lr]::
76571::$$$message_0711_0018_0002$$$::Illya keeps repeating that over and over as she buries her face in my chest.::
76572::$$$message_0711_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76573::$$$message_0711_0019_0001$$$::...Well, she's got me.[lr]::
76574::$$$message_0711_0019_0002$$$::I really have no idea what's going on, but if she's crying this much, then I'll just have to stay still and let her.::
76575::$$$message_0711_0020_0000$$$::"Do your injuries hurt? If anything feels off at all, let me know and I'll get you a replacement right away!"[lr]::
76576::$$$message_0711_0020_0001$$$::"...? No, it doesn't really hurt anywhere. Anyway, Illya, can you explain what[line2]"[lr]::
76577::$$$message_0711_0020_0002$$$::Before I can finish my question,[lr]::
76578::$$$message_0711_0020_0003$$$::"Grrrgh!?"::
76579::$$$message_0711_0021_0000$$$::I feel like a long blade is driven into my body.::
76580::$$$message_0711_0022_0000$$$::"Hah...grgh, zssrgh...!"[lr]::
76581::$$$message_0711_0022_0001$$$::I'm unable to bear the pain, my right hand scratching at my chest.::
76582::$$$message_0711_0023_0000$$$::"Shirou...!? Try to relax. You need to suppress the left arm, not just put up with it...!"[lr]::
76583::$$$message_0711_0023_0001$$$::"Uh...my left...arm...?"[lr]::
76584::$$$message_0711_0023_0002$$$::...I don't understand.[lr]::
76585::$$$message_0711_0023_0003$$$::I don't really understand, but I want the pain to stop.::
76586::$$$message_0711_0024_0000$$$::"...Hah...haah, hah...ah."[lr]::
76587::$$$message_0711_0024_0001$$$::...I calm my heart rate.[lr]::
76588::$$$message_0711_0024_0002$$$::Once I close my eyes and meditate, I immediately sense what's wrong.[lr]::
76589::$$$message_0711_0024_0003$$$::If I know the source of the pain, the foreign element, then I can slightly control the pain.[lr]::
76590::$$$message_0711_0024_0004$$$::I just need to build a barrier to prevent the alien parts from mixing with my own body.::
76591::$$$message_0711_0025_0000$$$::"...Whew. It's okay, I'm calm now, Illya."[lr]::
76592::$$$message_0711_0025_0001$$$::"Good, I can tell, too. I was worried what might happen, but you don't seem to be rejecting it."[lr]::
76593::$$$message_0711_0025_0002$$$::"...?"[lr]::
76594::$$$message_0711_0025_0003$$$::Illya seems to know where the pain is coming from.::
76595::$$$message_0711_0026_0000$$$::"...Hm?"[lr]::
76596::$$$message_0711_0026_0001$$$::I look down at myself and notice that I'm wearing a hospital gown.[lr]::
76597::$$$message_0711_0026_0002$$$::...No, it's more like a bunch of belts than a gown.[lr]::
76598::$$$message_0711_0026_0003$$$::The fact I can only move my right arm is proof enough. Everything else is fixed tightly in place. I can't even change my own clothes like this.::
76599::$$$message_0711_0027_0000$$$::"What's this? Why am I wearing this, Illya?"[lr]::
76600::$$$message_0711_0027_0001$$$::"Uh...um, that's..."[lr]::
76601::$$$message_0711_0027_0002$$$::She looks away uncomfortably.[lr]::
76602::$$$message_0711_0027_0003$$$::"I will explain, Shirou Emiya."[lr]::
76603::$$$message_0711_0027_0004$$$::And then,[lr]::
76604::$$$message_0711_0027_0005$$$::someone appears who I didn't really want to see.::
76605::$$$message_0711_0028_0000$$$::"She's recovering as well. I'm only going to debrief him, so if you don't have any business here, go wait in the lobby."[lr]::
76606::$$$message_0711_0028_0001$$$::"...Hmph, sure you will. I'm going to leave with Shirou. If you really aren't going to do anything to him, then there shouldn't be a problem if I stay."::
76607::$$$message_0711_0029_0000$$$::"I see. There is indeed no problem with it. But I'd like to keep the explanation brief. Go sit in a corner if you aren't going to interrupt me."[lr]::
76608::$$$message_0711_0029_0001$$$::"Fine, I'll do that."[lr]::
76609::$$$message_0711_0029_0002$$$::Illya walks by Kotomine and leans against a wall.::
76610::$$$message_0711_0030_0000$$$::"Now, then. Before I explain the situation, allow me to answer your question. Don't be too surprised, Shirou Emiya."[lr]::
76611::$$$message_0711_0030_0001$$$::Kotomine reaches out.[lr]::
76612::$$$message_0711_0030_0002$$$::The priest undoes the belt, exposing my skin.::
76613::$$$message_0711_0031_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
76614::$$$message_0711_0031_0001$$$::This arm doesn't belong to Shirou Emiya.::
76615::$$$message_0711_0032_0000$$$::I can tell even under all the cloth it's wrapped in.[lr]::
76616::$$$message_0711_0032_0001$$$::...The thing serving as my left arm came from somewhere else.[lr]::
76617::$$$message_0711_0032_0002$$$::It's something alien that defies the laws of nature, that should never be attached to me.::
76618::$$$message_0711_0033_0000$$$::"Kotomine, this is..."[lr]::
76619::$$$message_0711_0033_0001$$$::"Archer's left arm. I honored his last wishes and transplanted it from his corpse."::
76620::$$$message_0711_0034_0000$$$::"Archer's last wishes...? Wait, corpse? You mean he's..."[lr]::
76621::$$$message_0711_0034_0001$$$::"After the transplant, he disappeared. He was already on the verge of death when he brought you here. I'm surprised he lasted so long. It must be thanks to his Independent Action ability."::
76622::$$$message_0711_0035_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
76623::$$$message_0711_0035_0001$$$::Archer's gone.[lr]::
76624::$$$message_0711_0035_0002$$$::That means the only Servants left are Zouken's Assassin, Sakura's Rider, and...[lr]::
76625::$$$message_0711_0035_0003$$$::...No.[lr]::
76626::$$$message_0711_0035_0004$$$::She's changed so much that I don't think you can call her a Servant anymore.::
76627::$$$message_0711_0036_0000$$$::"...Wait. You said Archer disappeared. Then how is his arm still here?"::
76628::$$$message_0711_0037_0000$$$::"If he had passed on before the transplant was complete, then the arm would have gone as well. But your new arm was amputated and transplanted while he was still in the mortal world. It is the incarnated flesh of a Heroic Spirit, connected to Shirou Emiya's Magic Circuits and incarnated by your own magical energy.[lr]::
76629::$$$message_0711_0037_0001$$$::...It became a part of your body once the surgery was complete. Afterward, Archer disappeared, leaving his left arm behind. It is now your arm."::
76630::$$$message_0711_0038_0000$$$::"Then...this is really his arm?"[lr]::
76631::$$$message_0711_0038_0001$$$::"Yes. At the time, neither you nor Archer had much time left to live. Archer's spiritual core keeping him in this world was destroyed, and you were critically wounded, lacking vital life-sustaining tissues.[lr]::
76632::$$$message_0711_0038_0002$$$::Fortunately, Archer's body was only lightly damaged. He gave you the only unscathed part of his body so that you might live."::
76633::$$$message_0711_0039_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76634::$$$message_0711_0039_0001$$$::...The half of me that was swallowed up by the Shadow.[lr]::
76635::$$$message_0711_0039_0002$$$::The heat that invaded my mind, and this left arm that obviously belongs to someone else.[lr]::
76636::$$$message_0711_0039_0003$$$::Everything tells me that those events really happened.[lr]::
76637::$$$message_0711_0039_0004$$$::    I collapsed in the forest.[lr]::
76638::$$$message_0711_0039_0005$$$::Then, Archer saved my life.::
76639::$$$message_0711_0040_0000$$$::"...But can you really transplant Servant parts onto a human?"[lr]::
76640::$$$message_0711_0040_0001$$$::"It isn't impossible to connect them. It's said that spiritual healers treat the soul, not the body, and that priest turned out to be a real one, despite all appearances."::
76641::$$$message_0711_0041_0000$$$::"I'll accept the compliment, but it's hardly a joyous state of affairs.[lr]::
76642::$$$message_0711_0041_0001$$$::It is considered a forbidden art to connect different spiritual bodies, because it is always doomed to failure.[lr]::
76643::$$$message_0711_0041_0002$$$::The resurrection and restoration of spiritual bodies...of souls is a Mystic beyond the scope of magecraft. That is why I expected it to work only in shape, and that you would die of shock afterward..."::
76644::$$$message_0711_0042_0000$$$::"...But you and Archer are special. I just realized that earlier, too. If it was you two, you'd be able to bounce back."::
76645::$$$message_0711_0043_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
76646::$$$message_0711_0043_0001$$$::Illya avoids meeting my eyes, looking sad, somehow.::
76647::$$$message_0711_0044_0000$$$::"Oh? Well, I don't know the reason. I just know that you were highly compatible. I was surprised once the operation began. Even identical twins aren't so similar."[lr]::
76648::$$$message_0711_0044_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76649::$$$message_0711_0044_0002$$$::I try putting strength into my left arm, to confirm Kotomine's words.::
76650::$$$message_0711_0045_0000$$$::...I can't feel anything.[lr]::
76651::$$$message_0711_0045_0001$$$::There's no pain. It just feels like dead weight.[lr]::
76652::$$$message_0711_0045_0002$$$::I can't move it no matter what I do.[lr]::
76653::$$$message_0711_0045_0003$$$::It's like an arm gone numb from a lack of bloodflow.[lr]::
76654::$$$message_0711_0045_0004$$$::The sensation of having an attached arm I can't move causes mental fear, rather than physical pain.::
76655::$$$message_0711_0046_0000$$$::...My left arm is just a lump of iron now.[lr]::
76656::$$$message_0711_0046_0001$$$::Maybe this is what being a tin man would feel like.::
76657::$$$message_0711_0047_0000$$$::"...I can't move it at all. Did the surgery really work?"[lr]::
76658::$$$message_0711_0047_0001$$$::"Don't force it. It's only just been attached. Your body will be accustomed to it in a few days. As I said earlier, you two were exceptionally compatible with each other. You should be able to recover enough even to resume normal life."::
76659::$$$message_0711_0048_0000$$$::"But be warned. I am only saying that your circuits were compatible.[lr]::
76660::$$$message_0711_0048_0001$$$::No matter how compatible you are, that is the arm of a Heroic Spirit, which a human cannot handle. No, it's more weapon than limb. It is powerful, but it will draw you in if you use it."[lr]::
76661::$$$message_0711_0048_0002$$$::"You mean I'll die?"::
76662::$$$message_0711_0049_0000$$$::"Naturally. If the human Shirou Emiya uses the arm of a Heroic Spirit, the limb will invade your body. No, it would be more correct to say it will drive your body away."::
76663::$$$message_0711_0050_0000$$$::"Archer's arm is far beyond Shirou Emiya's spiritual core to sustain. If you use the arm even once, it will activate Archer's Magic Circuits.[lr]::
76664::$$$message_0711_0050_0001$$$::When that happens, your body will be unable to withstand Archer's magecraft and collapse from within.[lr]::
76665::$$$message_0711_0050_0002$$$::Hear me[line2]I am not saying that each use will shorten your life span.[lr]::
76666::$$$message_0711_0050_0003$$$::Once you use the arm, you will have lit the fuse on a time bomb."::
76667::$$$message_0711_0051_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76668::$$$message_0711_0051_0001$$$::What...the hell?[lr]::
76669::$$$message_0711_0051_0002$$$::Is he basically saying that if I try to copy what Archer does even once, I'm as good as dead?[lr]::
76670::$$$message_0711_0051_0003$$$::"...So that's what these bandages are for?"::
76671::$$$message_0711_0052_0000$$$::"Yes, they are a seal. So long as your left arm stays wrapped, its Magic Circuits will not manifest. Even if you use magecraft, the left arm won't act as a part of you.[lr]::
76672::$$$message_0711_0052_0001$$$::But do not be complacent. Magical energy runs through your body even when you aren't using magecraft. It may cause your left arm to react with pain or activation.[lr]::
76673::$$$message_0711_0052_0002$$$::I've wrapped your arm in the Holy Shroud of Martin to suppress its magical energy.[lr]::
76674::$$$message_0711_0052_0003$$$::As long as the shroud stays on, it will hinder the arm's invasion of your body, to an extent."::
76675::$$$message_0711_0053_0000$$$::"Wait. 'To an extent?' So not completely?"::
76676::$$$message_0711_0054_0000$$$::That is impossible... I suppose whether you use Archer's arm or not, it will ultimately consume you.[lr]::
76677::$$$message_0711_0054_0001$$$::If you want to live longer, then grow into a mage that can resist the arm. Then you may be able to keep it sealed even without the aid of the shroud."::
76678::$$$message_0711_0055_0000$$$::"I give it about ten years until the arm devours you completely. That is how much time he bought you. You can become capable enough to control the arm on your own, or fail and die. Either way, it is hardly an urgent matter."::
76679::$$$message_0711_0056_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
76680::$$$message_0711_0056_0001$$$::Hardly urgent? Someone just grafted this thing onto me when I wasn't even looking.[lr]::
76681::$$$message_0711_0056_0002$$$::...But there's no use whining now.[lr]::
76682::$$$message_0711_0056_0003$$$::I would have died in that forest.[lr]::
76683::$$$message_0711_0056_0004$$$::Archer's arm transplant saved my life, so I would be making light of his sacrifice if I complained.::
76684::$$$message_0711_0057_0000$$$::"...All right. Let me thank you.[lr]::
76685::$$$message_0711_0057_0001$$$::...You helped me out again, Father Kotomine. I'll pray that it doesn't happen a fourth time."[lr]::
76686::$$$message_0711_0057_0002$$$::"If you're well enough to run your mouth, then there's no need to worry about you. Now leave this place. Rin is waiting for you in the chapel."::
76687::$$$message_0711_0058_0000$$$::Kotomine heads for the exit.[lr]::
76688::$$$message_0711_0058_0001$$$::I get down from the bed and put on the clothes someone left for me.[lr]::
76689::$$$message_0711_0058_0002$$$::My left arm can't move, so I just slip on a coat.::
76690::$$$message_0711_0059_0000$$$::"All right. I think it won't hurt if I'm careful. Let's go, Illya."[lr]::
76691::$$$message_0711_0059_0001$$$::"Ah...okay. I'm coming."::
76692::$$$message_0711_0060_0000$$$::When we go outside, we're in the church's central garden.[lr]::
76693::$$$message_0711_0060_0001$$$::The sky is dark. It's already nighttime.::
76694::$$$message_0711_0061_0000$$$::"I forgot to mention that the Holy Shroud is easily removable, if you wish.[lr]::
76695::$$$message_0711_0061_0001$$$::The choice is always up to you. You're free to use Archer's arm, but I cannot guarantee your safety if you do.[lr]::
76696::$$$message_0711_0061_0002$$$::Keep that in mind and conduct yourself as best you can."::
76697::$$$message_0711_0062_0000$$$::When we enter the chapel, Tohsaka's glaring at me.[lr]::
76698::$$$message_0711_0062_0001$$$::...I don't remember her ever glaring at me like this before, but I'm relieved that she's safe.::
76699::$$$message_0711_0063_0000$$$::"Now, then. Everyone has been treated. Archer's arm ::
76700::$$$message_0711_0063_0001$$$::was transplanted to Shirou Emiya, and Rin has been detoxified. Do you have any further requests?"[lr]::
76701::$$$message_0711_0063_0002$$$::"...Of course not. If I owe you any more favors, I'll be putting my own life at risk."::
76702::$$$message_0711_0064_0000$$$::"I see. Then I suppose this concludes our meeting, but allow me to ask you something as overseer.[lr]::
76703::$$$message_0711_0064_0001$$$::What do you intend to do next, Rin?[lr]::
76704::$$$message_0711_0064_0002$$$::At this point, the Holy Grail War is a failure.[lr]::
76705::$$$message_0711_0064_0003$$$::Victory is close, with so few Servants remaining, despite this assembly of Masters."::
76706::$$$message_0711_0065_0000$$$::Tohsaka goes quiet for a moment.[lr]::
76707::$$$message_0711_0065_0001$$$::...As Kotomine says, the war's victor is almost decided.[lr]::
76708::$$$message_0711_0065_0002$$$::The only Masters left with Servants are Zouken and Sakura.[lr]::
76709::$$$message_0711_0065_0003$$$::...Normally, the last survivors would fight, but Sakura can't disobey Zouken. In that sense, he's already won.::
76710::$$$message_0711_0066_0000$$$::"Zouken Matou will likely decide to either retrieve Sakura Matou, or dispose of her. It would be difficult to prevent this, and neither of you are obligated to do so. After all, you have nothing to gain from defeating Zouken."[lr]::
76711::$$$message_0711_0066_0001$$$::"Oh, yeah? So you're saying that Masters without Servants can't get the Holy Grail?"::
76712::$$$message_0711_0067_0000$$$::"Yes. Thus, there is no point in any further conflict or combat. It would be the correct choice to quietly return home and wait for the war to conclude."[lr]::
76713::$$$message_0711_0067_0001$$$::"...Thanks for the warning. But I'm not forfeiting."::
76714::$$$message_0711_0068_0000$$$::"...I'm surprised. You mean you haven't given up on the Holy Grail?"[lr]::
76715::$$$message_0711_0068_0001$$$::"Of course not. I'm still a Master, even if I don't have a Servant. Don't go deciding on your own that I'll forfeit just because I'm alone."::
76716::$$$message_0711_0069_0000$$$::"Oh? True, quite true. Someone here marched to his death even without a Servant of his own. It seems you won't wave the white flag so easily." ::
76717::$$$message_0711_0070_0000$$$::"Hmph. Shirou has nothing to do with this.[lr]::
76718::$$$message_0711_0070_0001$$$::Look, it's my decision. I'm not giving up yet, and I don't feel like letting Zouken win. If I do either, then it won't help her at all."::
76719::$$$message_0711_0071_0000$$$::"Tohsaka..."[lr]::
76720::$$$message_0711_0071_0001$$$::I blink at her in surprise.::
76721::$$$message_0711_0072_0000$$$::"W-why do you look so happy? L-look, I'm not copying you or anything, okay? I'm just not giving up while I still have a chance at the prize. Unlike the way you keep sticking around even though you don't have a chance."[lr]::
76722::$$$message_0711_0072_0001$$$::"Yeah, I bet. I thought that's what you might say."::
76723::$$$message_0711_0073_0000$$$::"...I don't appreciate your tone, but as long as you get it."[lr]::
76724::$$$message_0711_0073_0001$$$::Tohsaka turns away with a huff.::
76725::$$$message_0711_0074_0000$$$::She isn't saying that she won't give up the Holy Grail to Zouken out of a sense of morality.[lr]::
76726::$$$message_0711_0074_0001$$$::If Zouken wins, then we can't save Sakura.[lr]::
76727::$$$message_0711_0074_0002$$$::If we want to save Sakura, then either Sakura has to win the Holy Grail, or someone willing to help her.::
76728::$$$message_0711_0075_0000$$$::Tohsaka's saying that if someone's going to win, then it should be her or Sakura.[lr]::
76729::$$$message_0711_0075_0001$$$::That's the only reason she needs to fight Zouken.[lr]::
76730::$$$message_0711_0075_0002$$$::Tohsaka can't actually obtain the Holy Grail anymore, but she still wants to help her little sister.::
76731::$$$message_0711_0076_0000$$$::"Hmm. How about you, Shirou Emiya? Will you still pursue the Holy Grail, like Rin?"[lr]::
76732::$$$message_0711_0076_0001$$$::"Yeah. I won't stop fighting. I have my own goal, too. I can't let Zouken do as he pleases."::
76733::$$$message_0711_0077_0000$$$::"...I see. I will not stop you if that is your choice. You have a fatal lack of combat strength, but Zouken Matou is weak. There may be methods of dealing with him."::
76734::$$$message_0711_0078_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
76735::$$$message_0711_0078_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
76736::$$$message_0711_0078_0002$$$::Our eyes meet.::
76737::$$$message_0711_0079_0000$$$::Methods, huh?[lr]::
76738::$$$message_0711_0079_0001$$$::I can't see any way to do it alone, but with Tohsaka, we might just find a way to defeat Zouken.::
76739::$$$message_0711_0080_0000$$$::The conversation ends.[lr]::
76740::$$$message_0711_0080_0001$$$::With our treatment complete, Kotomine states that he has no reason to shelter former Masters who don't even want protection, and asks us to leave.::
76741::$$$message_0711_0081_0000$$$::"We were going to leave anyway. Hey Illya, do you have anywhere to go?"[lr]::
76742::$$$message_0711_0081_0001$$$::"Hm? I still have my castle. Sella and Leys will come out if I call for them, so I still have a place to go home too... Why are you asking?"::
76743::$$$message_0711_0082_0000$$$::"Well, it could be dangerous out there alone. I was thinking you could stay over at my place, if you want. I think it would be more convenient for you, too."[lr]::
76744::$$$message_0711_0082_0001$$$::"Okay, but I'm not coming. That woman is at your house."[lr]::
76745::$$$message_0711_0082_0002$$$::Huh.[lr]::
76746::$$$message_0711_0082_0003$$$::What an odd thing to say.::
76747::$$$message_0711_0083_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
76748::$$$message_0711_0083_0001$$$::I look to Tohsaka for answers, unsure what Illya meant by that.[lr]::
76749::$$$message_0711_0083_0002$$$::Oh. She's giving me a look that says not to drag her into this.::
76750::$$$message_0711_0084_0000$$$::"Oh? So you've chosen Sakura Matou, Shirou Emiya."[lr]::
76751::$$$message_0711_0084_0001$$$::"...Kotomine?"::
76752::$$$message_0711_0085_0000$$$::"I don't mind taking Illyasviel in. Zouken would only try to abduct her again if she went back to the castle."[lr]::
76753::$$$message_0711_0085_0001$$$::"Hell no. I'm taking Illya in."[lr]::
76754::$$$message_0711_0085_0002$$$::"Heck no. I need to borrow Illya."[lr]::
76755::$$$message_0711_0085_0003$$$::"No thanks. I'll decide where I'm going to stay."::
76756::$$$message_0711_0086_0000$$$::"...[lr]::
76757::$$$message_0711_0086_0001$$$::That is disappointing to hear. Then I suppose Illyasviel will be staying at the Tohsaka mansion."[lr]::
76758::$$$message_0711_0086_0002$$$::"D-don't be stupid! An Einzbern Master would never live at the Tohsaka house!"::
76759::$$$message_0711_0087_0000$$$::"That so? Then where are you gonna go? You won't stay with Shirou, you don't want to go to the Church, and my house isn't good enough for you. Guess you're going back to the castle, then?"::
76760::$$$message_0711_0088_0000$$$::"I know that. That's my atelier to begin with, so I don't need to rely on other Masters for help. I can take care of myself even without Berserker."::
76761::$$$message_0711_0089_0000$$$::"Oh wow, really? Shirou saved your life, but you're just gonna run back to the castle without an ounce of gratitude.[lr]::
76762::$$$message_0711_0089_0001$$$::Hear that, Emiya? She doesn't like you, even though you went to all that trouble. She's saying your house is too stuffy for her."::
76763::$$$message_0711_0090_0000$$$::"W-what are you talking about, Rin!?[lr]::
76764::$$$message_0711_0090_0001$$$::I never said..."[lr]::
76765::$$$message_0711_0090_0002$$$::"You're saying it right now. You don't want to go to Emiya's house because you don't want to rely on him, right? You'd feel better back at your own castle."::
76766::$$$message_0711_0091_0000$$$::"That's true, but... But I need to go back to the castle because I should stay away from Shirou..."[lr]::
76767::$$$message_0711_0091_0001$$$::"Huh? Oh, I see. You don't only want to avoid asking him for help, you don't even like him personally. Why didn't you say so earlier?"[lr]::
76768::$$$message_0711_0091_0002$$$::Tohsaka ruthlessly prods Illya.::
76769::$$$message_0711_0092_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
76770::$$$message_0711_0092_0001$$$::This is bad.[lr]::
76771::$$$message_0711_0092_0002$$$::I start to worry that this might turn into a fight that can only be settled with blood, when...::
76772::$$$message_0711_0093_0000$$$::"Th-that's not true! I never said that I don't like Shirou! There's something else that I don't like...!"[lr]::
76773::$$$message_0711_0093_0001$$$::"See? You're so popular, Emiya."[lr]::
76774::$$$message_0711_0093_0002$$$::Tohsaka snickers quietly,[lr]::
76775::$$$message_0711_0093_0003$$$::while Illya glares at her with frustration.::
76776::$$$message_0711_0094_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
76777::$$$message_0711_0094_0001$$$::...Um.[lr]::
76778::$$$message_0711_0094_0002$$$::So, whose house is Illya going to...?::ß
