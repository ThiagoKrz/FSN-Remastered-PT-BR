50116::$$$message_0433_0000_0000$$$::"I'm coming...!"[lr]::
50117::$$$message_0433_0000_0001$$$::I scurry to the door.[lr]::
50118::$$$message_0433_0000_0002$$$::It's rare for someone to visit at this hour.[lr]::
50119::$$$message_0433_0000_0003$$$::Fuji-nee doesn't ring the doorbell, and she has a spare key.[lr]::
50120::$$$message_0433_0000_0004$$$::I don't have many visitors, and since there's no houses around, I don't have many neighbors.::
50121::$$$message_0433_0001_0000$$$::"...I wonder who it could be."[lr]::
50122::$$$message_0433_0001_0001$$$::Well, it can't be anyone with a grudge since the alarm of my old man's Bounded Field isn't going off, so it must be one of the young people from Fuji-nee's place.::
50123::$$$message_0433_0002_0000$$$::"Who is it?"[lr]::
50124::$$$message_0433_0002_0001$$$::I say, and open the door.[lr]::
50125::$$$message_0433_0002_0002$$$::Suddenly...[lr]::
50126::$$$message_0433_0002_0003$$$::My mind goes blank.::
50127::$$$message_0433_0003_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
50128::$$$message_0433_0003_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
50129::$$$message_0433_0003_0002$$$::We stare at each other in silence.[lr]::
50130::$$$message_0433_0003_0003$$$::...Well, Tohsaka looks angry. I'm still not sure what to make of this.::
50131::$$$message_0433_0004_0000$$$::"T-Tohsaka... Why?"[lr]::
50132::$$$message_0433_0004_0001$$$::"You ditched our regular contact."::
50133::$$$message_0433_0005_0000$$$::"D-ditched our regular contact? I did forget to go see you today, but did we ever agree on such a thing?"[lr]::
50134::$$$message_0433_0005_0001$$$::"..."::
50135::$$$message_0433_0006_0000$$$::Tohsaka glares at me silently.[lr]::
50136::$$$message_0433_0006_0001$$$::...This is bad.[lr]::
50137::$$$message_0433_0006_0002$$$::I don't know why she's mad, but it must be bad.::
50138::$$$message_0433_0007_0000$$$::"...Sorry. It's my fault for forgetting. It was my duty as an ally to contact you on a regular basis."::
50139::$$$message_0433_0008_0000$$$::"...That's right. Our situation hasn't changed, so it's natural for us to check up on each other."::
50140::$$$message_0433_0009_0000$$$::I sigh with relief.[lr]::
50141::$$$message_0433_0009_0001$$$::It's surprising enough to have Tohsaka at my door, but having her show up like this guns blazing might as well be an out-of-body experience.[lr]::
50142::$$$message_0433_0009_0002$$$::I have to solve this real quick. My nerves can't take this kind of thing, especially right now.::
50143::$$$message_0433_0010_0000$$$::"...I understand. I'll contact you right away, so you can go home now. Sorry to make you come all the way here."[lr]::
50144::$$$message_0433_0010_0001$$$::...Uh.[lr]::
50145::$$$message_0433_0010_0002$$$::Why are you making such a face, Tohsaka?::
50146::$$$message_0433_0011_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka? I got your message, so aren't we going to meet up at the park under the bridge later?"[lr]::
50147::$$$message_0433_0011_0001$$$::I have a bad feeling...[lr]::
50148::$$$message_0433_0011_0002$$$::And that must've been the last straw.[lr]::
50149::$$$message_0433_0011_0003$$$::Tohsaka, who's good at reading my weaknesses and fears...::
50150::$$$message_0433_0012_0000$$$::"No. This is a good opportunity, so we'll hold the meeting here today.[lr]::
50151::$$$message_0433_0012_0001$$$::You wouldn't turn away a friend who came all the way here to see you, right?"[lr]::
50152::$$$message_0433_0012_0002$$$::...speaks the words of, and smiles like, a devil.::
50153::$$$message_0433_0013_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]Hold the meeting here... Are you saying you're going to come into my house...!?"[lr]::
50154::$$$message_0433_0013_0001$$$::"What? You've been to mine too. And it's not like this is the first time, so there shouldn't be anything to hide from me at this point."::
50155::$$$message_0433_0014_0000$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
50156::$$$message_0433_0014_0001$$$::Right.[lr]::
50157::$$$message_0433_0014_0002$$$::It was Tohsaka who treated me when I fainted the night that I first met Saber.::
50158::$$$message_0433_0015_0000$$$::But I was confused then since I had just become a Master, so it didn't register that Tohsaka was at my house.[lr]::
50159::$$$message_0433_0015_0001$$$::Even if we're in a truce, Tohsaka is Tohsaka. She's the school's idol and a girl of my age. It's an outrageous situation for her to come into my house... Wait, why is she in the hallway!?::
50160::$$$message_0433_0016_0000$$$::"Well, excuse me. We're going to be talking, so we can do it in the living room, right?"[lr]::
50161::$$$message_0433_0016_0001$$$::"H-h-hold on, n-not so fast! Are you really fine with this? It'll be terrible for you to come into my house!"::
50162::$$$message_0433_0017_0000$$$::"It's fine, it's fine. Oh, I also haven't had lunch, so I'll be counting on you."[lr]::
50163::$$$message_0433_0017_0001$$$::The intruder, Rin Tohsaka, comes barging in.::
50164::$$$message_0433_0018_0000$$$::"Wait, hold on...! Stop doing things without thinking!"[lr]::
50165::$$$message_0433_0018_0001$$$::I object in a loud voice, but it has no effect on the enemy.[lr]::
50166::$$$message_0433_0018_0002$$$::The intruder casually goes to the living room, leaving me confused in the hallway.::
50167::$$$message_0433_0019_0000$$$::...Then...[lr]::
50168::$$$message_0433_0019_0001$$$::Still not completely sure what's going on, the three of us eat lunch and then talk about our future plans.::
50169::$$$message_0433_0020_0000$$$::The topic of discussion is about Caster, of course.[lr]::
50170::$$$message_0433_0020_0001$$$::We discuss for nearly four hours about how to defeat her at the temple, but the results are not looking good.::
50171::$$$message_0433_0021_0000$$$::"...Ugh. So the only choice we have is to beat them straight on. If what Saber said is true, then Servants can only get in from the front entrance."::
50172::$$$message_0433_0022_0000$$$::"Yes. There is a strong Bounded Field set up against spirits at that mountain, so the only option for me is to charge in from the front entrance. Meanwhile, Archer, whose class allows him to move around more independently, may be able to manage to get in by force."::
50173::$$$message_0433_0023_0000$$$::"So, after he manages to get in using all his energy, Caster will be waiting for him, right? He'll just be bait."::
50174::$$$message_0433_0024_0000$$$:: "...That's true. He can't be the target when he's the one who should be shooting. Well, if it's just Assassin, then I'm sure Saber and Archer can defeat him, but the problem is how they should corner Caster once they get inside.[lr]::
50175::$$$message_0433_0024_0001$$$::From what you said, there's a big pool of magical energy there. If we corner her, she might try to drag us down along with the temple."::
50176::$$$message_0433_0025_0000$$$::"That is a possibility. Caster does not seem like the type who will graciously accept death. If she is going to die, it is possible that she will act in retribution. Ryudou Temple would be destroyed in such a case as well."::
50177::$$$message_0433_0026_0000$$$::"Saber, don't just casually say something scary like that.[lr]::
50178::$$$message_0433_0026_0001$$$::Are you saying that Caster will self-destruct if we corner her?"[lr]::
50179::$$$message_0433_0026_0002$$$::"Yeah, that's what we're saying."[lr]::
50180::$$$message_0433_0026_0003$$$::"She most likely will."::
50181::$$$message_0433_0027_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
50182::$$$message_0433_0027_0001$$$::The two of them are completely in sync.[lr]::
50183::$$$message_0433_0027_0002$$$::If I think back, Saber and Tohsaka have always had the same opinions from the start and seem to approve of each other in battle.[lr]::
50184::$$$message_0433_0027_0003$$$::If they're both saying we shouldn't attack there, then attacking the temple must really be impossible.::
50185::$$$message_0433_0028_0000$$$::"Oh. What, it's already this late?"[lr]::
50186::$$$message_0433_0028_0001$$$::The clock's sound echoes through the living room.[lr]::
50187::$$$message_0433_0028_0002$$$::By the time we realize it, it's already 6 PM, and the sky is tinted red.::
50188::$$$message_0433_0029_0000$$$::"...Well, I guess the meeting's over.[lr]::
50189::$$$message_0433_0029_0001$$$::I need to start preparing dinner."[lr]::
50190::$$$message_0433_0029_0002$$$::I stand up.[lr]::
50191::$$$message_0433_0029_0003$$$::We're having cod pot tonight, so it shouldn't take too long to cook.[lr]::
50192::$$$message_0433_0029_0004$$$::All I have to do is cook rice and make something that would go with hot pot, but...::
50193::$$$message_0433_0030_0000$$$::"What, Emiya? Why are you looking at me?"[lr]::
50194::$$$message_0433_0030_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50195::$$$message_0433_0030_0002$$$::...So, like...[lr]::
50196::$$$message_0433_0030_0003$$$::Why is she making herself at home when we're about to have dinner?::
50197::$$$message_0433_0031_0000$$$::"Also, why are you sitting so far away from me? I don't know if that's your usual spot, but it's inconvenient if you're not closer when we're talking. Why are you all the way over there?"::
50198::$$$message_0433_0032_0000$$$::Tohsaka, sitting dignified at the table, watches me carefully.[lr]::
50199::$$$message_0433_0032_0001$$$::...There's only one reason why I'm distancing myself from Tohsaka.::
50200::$$$message_0433_0033_0000$$$::"Don't be ridiculous, you're the one who took my usual spot! I'm sitting here because you're there!"[lr]::
50201::$$$message_0433_0033_0001$$$::I object with all my might.::
50202::$$$message_0433_0034_0000$$$::"Heh, I see. You didn't care about it when we're outside since we're both Masters, but you go back to being yourself when you're at home, huh?"::
50203::$$$message_0433_0035_0000$$$::"I-Is that a problem, idiot!? And, you know, I'm a guy, so it's only natural!"[lr]::
50204::$$$message_0433_0035_0001$$$::It'd be more surprising if I weren't nervous around a girl my age. And Tohsaka, at that.::
50205::$$$message_0433_0036_0000$$$::While we've been having these strategy meetings, I have to frequently remind myself how this is happening because we're both Masters. [lr]::
50206::$$$message_0433_0036_0001$$$::I feel pathetic, but even this has been nerve-wracking. I don't know how many cups of tea I've drunk while sitting here.::
50207::$$$message_0433_0037_0000$$$::"Well isn't that strange, then? Saber is also a girl, and from what I hear, Ms. Fujimura and Sakura also come here, right? Then I should be no different."::
50208::$$$message_0433_0038_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
50209::$$$message_0433_0038_0001$$$::That's different![lr]::
50210::$$$message_0433_0038_0002$$$::Saber and Tohsaka are different, Fuji-nee and Tohsaka are different, and Sakura and Tohsaka are different.[lr]::
50211::$$$message_0433_0038_0003$$$::And I mean, the only reason I can be normal around Saber is because we're in this fight together.::
50212::$$$message_0433_0039_0000$$$::"...Hmph, just go home. We're going to have dinner. Archer is also waiting for you at home, right?"[lr]::
50213::$$$message_0433_0039_0001$$$::"Oh. I can't go home when we haven't come up with anything yet.[lr]::
50214::$$$message_0433_0039_0002$$$::Aren't we going to decide our future plans after we eat dinner?"::
50215::$$$message_0433_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
50216::$$$message_0433_0040_0001$$$::Man, I seriously feel dizzy.::
50217::$$$message_0433_0041_0000$$$::"Guh... Is that matter already decided, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
50218::$$$message_0433_0041_0001$$$::"Is it not? It's fine if you don't want to. So you're fine with letting Caster be for a while then?"[lr]::
50219::$$$message_0433_0041_0002$$$::"Gah..."[lr]::
50220::$$$message_0433_0041_0003$$$::I swallow the complaint that was stuck in my throat.::
50221::$$$message_0433_0042_0000$$$::"Shirou. She does have a point. There is no problem with her staying here."[lr]::
50222::$$$message_0433_0042_0001$$$::To top it off, Saber even takes Tohsaka's side.::
50223::$$$message_0433_0043_0000$$$::"...Fine. But I won't be accountable if you don't like my food. And I'm sure Fuji-nee[line2]Ms. Fujimura will be coming, so you'll have to convince her then."::
50224::$$$message_0433_0044_0000$$$::"I know, I know. I already know how good you are at cooking from lunch, and I know about Ms. Fujimura too. I'm aware of them both, so don't worry."::
50225::$$$message_0433_0045_0000$$$::"...Hmph. I won't be accountable if you change your mind either."[lr]::
50226::$$$message_0433_0045_0001$$$::I look away and face the kitchen.::
50227::$$$message_0433_0046_0000$$$::    Then...[lr]::
50228::$$$message_0433_0046_0001$$$::I wash my hands and go to put on my apron, but find that it isn't where it always is.[lr]::
50229::$$$message_0433_0046_0002$$$::...No.[lr]::
50230::$$$message_0433_0046_0003$$$::First of all, I don't remember taking it off after preparing lunch while worrying about Tohsaka watching me.::
50231::$$$message_0433_0047_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
50232::$$$message_0433_0047_0001$$$::I look around.::
50233::$$$message_0433_0048_0000$$$::She laughs at my confusion, and...[lr]::
50234::$$$message_0433_0048_0001$$$::"Also, I forgot to mention. I don't know how to feel about a guy who walks around wearing an apron, Emiya."[lr]::
50235::$$$message_0433_0048_0002$$$::...takes a parting shot with a smirk on her face.::
