70456::$$$message_0643_0000_0001$$$::It's midnight, the time we agreed on.::
70457::$$$message_0643_0001_0000$$$::I wrap up the Azoth Blade and keep it on my waist.[lr]::
70458::$$$message_0643_0001_0001$$$::It's my only weapon. The only other thing I take with me is the pendant Tohsaka talked about.::
70459::$$$message_0643_0002_0000$$$::"Shirou, Rin's calling for you. She said she'll be waiting outside, so come when you're ready."[lr]::
70460::$$$message_0643_0002_0001$$$::Illya will stay here.[lr]::
70461::$$$message_0643_0002_0002$$$::It's true that Zouken's targeting Illya, but it's also my wish for her to stay here.::
70462::$$$message_0643_0003_0000$$$::"All right. Tohsaka's waiting outside for me?"[lr]::
70463::$$$message_0643_0003_0001$$$::"Yeah. She looked impatient, so you'd better go or she'll start grumbling."::

70465::$$$message_0643_0004_0001$$$::I nod at Illya and stand up.[lr]::
70466::$$$message_0643_0004_0002$$$::My left arm doesn't hurt anymore.[lr]::
70467::$$$message_0643_0004_0003$$$::My functions as a living creature are just slowly being eroded.::
70468::$$$message_0643_0005_0000$$$::If I stop, I won't know what I'm doing.::
70469::$$$message_0643_0006_0000$$$::"I'm going, then. Take care, Illya."[lr]::
70470::$$$message_0643_0006_0001$$$::"Good luck, Shirou. Come home with Sakura and Rin before dawn, okay?"[lr]::
70471::$$$message_0643_0006_0002$$$::I wave at Illya and leave the room.::
70472::$$$message_0643_0007_0000$$$::The living room is silent.[lr]::
70473::$$$message_0643_0007_0001$$$::Ten years.[lr]::
70474::$$$message_0643_0007_0002$$$::So much has happened here. I've made a lot of memories.[lr]::
70475::$$$message_0643_0007_0003$$$::Much of it came recently.[lr]::
70476::$$$message_0643_0007_0004$$$::This morning scene became so familiar to me over the last year and a half.::
70477::$$$message_0643_0008_0000$$$::The shed is silent.[lr]::
70478::$$$message_0643_0008_0001$$$::It's Shirou Emiya's tiny workshop. A place I spent so much time in, it was like my own bedroom.[lr]::
70479::$$$message_0643_0008_0002$$$::This is where I followed in Kiritsugu's footsteps and threw myself into training every night.[lr]::
70480::$$$message_0643_0008_0003$$$::When I fell asleep here, sometimes she would come to wake me up.[lr]::
70481::$$$message_0643_0008_0004$$$::It feels like it happened a long time ago. I can even remember the smell of the air.::
70482::$$$message_0643_0009_0000$$$::The bedroom is silent.[lr]::
70483::$$$message_0643_0009_0001$$$::It's a guestroom that's only been used for the last several days.[lr]::
70484::$$$message_0643_0009_0002$$$::There aren't any memories here,[lr]::
70485::$$$message_0643_0009_0003$$$::but it reminds me of Sakura.::
70486::$$$message_0643_0010_0000$$$::"...Haah."[lr]::
70487::$$$message_0643_0010_0001$$$::I sigh and lean against the wall.[lr]::
70488::$$$message_0643_0010_0002$$$::I can't remember.[lr]::
70489::$$$message_0643_0010_0003$$$::I can't remember anything that happened in this house, or anything I've experienced.[lr]::
70490::$$$message_0643_0010_0004$$$::And yet...[lr]::
70491::$$$message_0643_0010_0005$$$::When I walk through these rooms, Sakura's face clearly comes to mind.::
70492::$$$message_0643_0011_0000$$$::"Man, I can't believe..."[lr]::
70493::$$$message_0643_0011_0001$$$::...how much Sakura means to me.[lr]::
70494::$$$message_0643_0011_0002$$$::It's a struggle to just stay conscious; my memories are all over the place.[lr]::
70495::$$$message_0643_0011_0003$$$::The ten years I've spent in this house are turning into a haze.::
70496::$$$message_0643_0012_0000$$$::But there's something I still remember well.[lr]::
70497::$$$message_0643_0012_0001$$$::No matter what else I'll lose, the memory of Sakura will always be fresh in my mind.::
70498::$$$message_0643_0013_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
70499::$$$message_0643_0013_0001$$$::I heave a long sigh.[lr]::
70500::$$$message_0643_0013_0002$$$::What I need to do has always been the same.::
70501::$$$message_0643_0014_0000$$$::"All right. Let's go, Sakura."[lr]::
70502::$$$message_0643_0014_0001$$$::I anchor my disconnected mind, and leave Sakura's room.::
70503::$$$message_0643_0015_0000$$$::I leave nothing behind.[lr]::
70504::$$$message_0643_0015_0001$$$::Once, we made a promise here.[lr]::
70505::$$$message_0643_0015_0002$$$::We knew we couldn't keep it, but we said it to encourage each other.::
70506::$$$message_0643_0016_0000$$$::I'll make it again right now.[lr]::
70507::$$$message_0643_0016_0001$$$::It was a small glimmer of hope that we'd go somewhere together.::†›
