3044::$$$message_0030_0000_0001$$$::"It would seem to be lunchtime, Shirou."[lr]::
3045::$$$message_0030_0000_0002$$$::"Yeah, it is."[lr]::
3046::$$$message_0030_0000_0003$$$::Both our stomachs growl in agreement.::
3047::$$$message_0030_0001_0000$$$::"Let's eat. Is there anything you'd like to eat, Saber?"[lr]::
3048::$$$message_0030_0001_0001$$$::"Not in particular. I have been satisfied with each meal you have prepared thus far."::
3049::$$$message_0030_0002_0000$$$::Saber puts it kind of oddly.[lr]::
3050::$$$message_0030_0002_0001$$$::...Well, at least she's not picky like Tohsaka.::
3051::$$$message_0030_0003_0000$$$::"I'll go do a bit of shopping. I'll probably come back the same time as yesterday, so rest in the living room until then."[lr]::
3052::$$$message_0030_0003_0001$$$::"Yes. I will be waiting, Shirou."::
3053::$$$message_0030_0004_0000$$$::I decide to try making shrimp balls for lunch; I've always wanted to try making them at home.[lr]::
3054::$$$message_0030_0004_0001$$$::They'll be piping hot balls of ground shrimp, a bit bigger than takoyaki.::
3055::$$$message_0030_0005_0000$$$::"...I bought some mustard and I'm all set with the snacks for our three o'clock snack time."[lr]::
3056::$$$message_0030_0005_0001$$$::I load my purchases onto my bike.[lr]::
3057::$$$message_0030_0005_0002$$$::   That reminds me. [lr]::
3058::$$$message_0030_0005_0003$$$::I met Illya here yesterday.::
3059::$$$message_0030_0006_0000$$$::"She's not here today."[lr]::
3060::$$$message_0030_0006_0001$$$::Well, she probably shouldn't be coming here every day. Somehow, not seeing her is disappointing though.[lr]::
3061::$$$message_0030_0006_0002$$$::I haven't told Saber or Tohsaka about meeting Illya yesterday.[lr]::
3062::$$$message_0030_0006_0003$$$::She didn't confront me as an enemy...and I'm hesitant to tell them about her in the first place.::
3063::$$$message_0030_0007_0000$$$::"...Just because she was here yesterday doesn't mean she'll show up today."[lr]::
3064::$$$message_0030_0007_0001$$$::So I really should get on my bike and...[lr]::¿¶
