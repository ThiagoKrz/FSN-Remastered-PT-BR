21163::$$$message_0190_0000_0001$$$::I stop.[lr]::
21164::$$$message_0190_0000_0002$$$::I make it out of the church, but my body tells me it's reached its limit.::
21165::$$$message_0190_0001_0000$$$::"Shirou. Let us rest here. Your body will not last like this."[lr]::
21166::$$$message_0190_0001_0001$$$::"Ngh...yeah... I hate that I'm causing you so much trouble..."[lr]::
21167::$$$message_0190_0001_0002$$$::I lean away from Saber's shoulders and sit on the grass.::
21168::$$$message_0190_0002_0000$$$::"Nnngh."[lr]::
21169::$$$message_0190_0002_0001$$$::My chest wound is still there.[lr]::
21170::$$$message_0190_0002_0002$$$::It's stopped bleeding, but there's still a gaping hole in my chest.::
21171::$$$message_0190_0003_0000$$$::"I feel...sick..."[lr]::
21172::$$$message_0190_0003_0001$$$::The pain might be gone, but I've still got a hole right through me.[lr]::
21173::$$$message_0190_0003_0002$$$::Just looking at it makes me sick to my stomach. More than that, I can't believe I'm still alive.::
21174::$$$message_0190_0004_0000$$$::"Shirou. Please show me your wound."::
21175::$$$message_0190_0005_0000$$$::"Oh...uh...okay..."[lr]::
21176::$$$message_0190_0005_0001$$$::"Please excuse me. It may hurt a bit, but please bear with me."[lr]::
21177::$$$message_0190_0005_0002$$$::Saber's fingers trail over my chest.[lr]::
21178::$$$message_0190_0005_0003$$$::   And then...[lr]::
21179::$$$message_0190_0005_0004$$$::I don't know what she's thinking, but Saber places her hand on my chest and lets it sink [font italic=true]into[font italic=false] my body!::
21180::$$$message_0190_0006_0000$$$::"Ah...agggh!"[lr]::
21181::$$$message_0190_0006_0001$$$::My entire body jerks and bucks in response.[lr]::
21182::$$$message_0190_0006_0002$$$::Saber's hand is relentless, moving around inside me...[lr]::
21183::$$$message_0190_0006_0003$$$::"Idio[line2]what are you!?"[lr]::
21184::$$$message_0190_0006_0004$$$::[font italic=true]She's touching my organs with her bare hands!!![font italic=false][lr]::
21185::$$$message_0190_0006_0005$$$::How could that not be blindingly painful?[sestop time=3000 nowait=1 storage=se029][seloop storage=se069 volume=70][lr]::
21186::$$$message_0190_0006_0006$$$::It should hurt, but...::
21187::$$$message_0190_0007_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
21188::$$$message_0190_0007_0001$$$::There's absolutely no pain.[lr]::
21189::$$$message_0190_0007_0002$$$::In fact, everywhere Saber touches, it feels like the pain is fading...::
21190::$$$message_0190_0008_0000$$$::"I am done, Shirou. I have replenished the sheath's magical energy. Your wound should heal in half a day."[lr]::
21191::$$$message_0190_0008_0001$$$::She draws her hand from my chest, looking relieved.::
21192::$$$message_0190_0009_0000$$$::"Sheath?"[lr]::
21193::$$$message_0190_0009_0001$$$::I have no idea what she's talking about.::
21194::$$$message_0190_0010_0000$$$::"Saber, what do you mean by sheath? You mentioned it before...but, are you talking about your sheath?"::
21195::$$$message_0190_0011_0000$$$::Saber's sheath.[lr]::
21196::$$$message_0190_0011_0001$$$::It has to be Excalibur's sheath.[lr]::
21197::$$$message_0190_0011_0002$$$::Invisible Air isn't her sheath.[lr]::
21198::$$$message_0190_0011_0003$$$::The legendary sheath of Excalibur is a Noble Phantasm that makes its possessor immortal.::
21199::$$$message_0190_0012_0000$$$::But she doesn't have it.[lr]::
21200::$$$message_0190_0012_0001$$$::King Arthur died in the Battle of Camlann because that sheath was lost.[lr]::
21201::$$$message_0190_0012_0002$$$::So there's no way Saber has Excalibur's sheath right now...::
21202::$$$message_0190_0013_0000$$$::"Yes. My sheath is inside your body. Not realizing that until last night is my failure."[lr]::
21203::$$$message_0190_0013_0001$$$::"Inside...me? That sounds kind of absurd."::
21204::$$$message_0190_0014_0000$$$::"Do you really think so? It is actually quite simple, really. You summoned me. It was foolish to think that you were able to do that by sheer coincidence."::
21205::$$$message_0190_0015_0000$$$::"To summon a Heroic Spirit, one must possess a symbol that has some connection to that Heroic Spirit. As you had no knowledge of being Master, nor any experience as a mage, you must have had some sort of connection to me.[lr]::
21206::$$$message_0190_0015_0001$$$::That is where my sheath...the lost sheath of Excalibur...comes in."::
21207::$$$message_0190_0016_0000$$$::"Uh...well, that might be true, but...[lr]::
21208::$$$message_0190_0016_0001$$$::But why is something like that inside me?"::
21209::$$$message_0190_0017_0000$$$::"I expect that was Kiritsugu's doing.[lr]::
21210::$$$message_0190_0017_0001$$$::In the previous war, Kiritsugu Emiya summoned me using Excalibur's sheath as a catalyst. As the sheath is a Noble Phantasm that heals the possessor's wounds, Kiritsugu must have determined that it would be advantageous to hold on to it rather than return it to me."::
21211::$$$message_0190_0018_0000$$$::"I am already able to heal myself, which makes it difficult to kill me.[lr]::
21212::$$$message_0190_0018_0001$$$::Allowing the Master, who is more vulnerable, to hold the sheath would increase his chances of winning the war."[lr]::
21213::$$$message_0190_0018_0002$$$::"So my old man survived the war pretty much the same way as I've been surviving."::
21214::$$$message_0190_0019_0000$$$::"Most likely, yes. And when the war was over and I disappeared...[lr]::
21215::$$$message_0190_0019_0001$$$::Kiritsugu was wandering through the fiery ruins and found a dying child. He did not have any healing powers, and it was probably too late anyway.[lr]::
21216::$$$message_0190_0019_0002$$$::And so, he saw only one method to save the child."::
21217::$$$message_0190_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21218::$$$message_0190_0020_0001$$$::My hand goes to my chest.[lr]::
21219::$$$message_0190_0020_0002$$$::On that day ten years ago...[lr]::
21220::$$$message_0190_0020_0003$$$::I accepted death as I was looking up at that sky.[lr]::
21221::$$$message_0190_0020_0004$$$::My whole body was burned. Maybe I really was little more than cinders.::
21222::$$$message_0190_0021_0000$$$::So when Kiritsugu found a kid that was barely alive, he had to rely on the one thing he had with him.[lr]::
21223::$$$message_0190_0021_0001$$$::The sacred sword's sheath, said to protect the possessor's life.[lr]::
21224::$$$message_0190_0021_0002$$$::By implanting the sheath in me, he saved the child who was on the verge of death.::
21225::$$$message_0190_0022_0000$$$::"So you're saying...?"[lr]::
21226::$$$message_0190_0022_0001$$$::"Yes. It has been disassembled and lacks its original shape, but your body does contain the sheath. That is the source of your healing abilities."::
21227::$$$message_0190_0023_0000$$$::"B-but...I almost died. When Lancer stabbed me at school, and..."[lr]::
21228::$$$message_0190_0023_0001$$$::That's right...[lr]::
21229::$$$message_0190_0023_0002$$$::Someone saved me then.[lr]::
21230::$$$message_0190_0023_0003$$$::By the time I came to, there was nobody there...just a piece of rock lying next to me.[lr]::
21231::$$$message_0190_0023_0004$$$::I felt that was really important, so I brought it home. I wonder if it's still there?::
21232::$$$message_0190_0024_0000$$$::"That is before you and I formed a contract.[lr]::
21233::$$$message_0190_0024_0001$$$::The sheath is my Noble Phantasm. Until I manifested and infused it with magical energy, it would not function as a Noble Phantasm. Until you formed a contract with me, you would not have the power of immortality."::
21234::$$$message_0190_0025_0000$$$::"Though, as long as it has even a little magical energy within it, it may be able to protect the possessor's life. But it would be weak. To save a human being on the verge of death, it must have been necessary to integrate the sheath into your body."::
21235::$$$message_0190_0026_0000$$$::"I see. Um...sorry, Saber. I feel bad for using your sheath for myself."::
21236::$$$message_0190_0027_0000$$$::"What are you talking about? You are my Master; it is quite natural for you to use what is mine.[lr]::
21237::$$$message_0190_0027_0001$$$::Besides...I was happy when I learned the truth. Even though I could not save anyone from that disaster, my sheath still saved your life."::
21238::$$$message_0190_0028_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21239::$$$message_0190_0028_0001$$$::Her smile is so bright, I can't help but look away.::
21240::$$$message_0190_0029_0000$$$::"Shirou? Um, does your wound hurt?"[lr]::
21241::$$$message_0190_0029_0001$$$::"No, that's not it. It's fine. Don't worry about it. You did nothing wrong!"[lr]::
21242::$$$message_0190_0029_0002$$$::I cover my blushing face and fall silent.[lr]::
21243::$$$message_0190_0029_0003$$$::...This is so embarrassing.[lr]::
21244::$$$message_0190_0029_0004$$$::Not speaking means no pain, but this is really awkward.::
21245::$$$message_0190_0030_0000$$$::I'm not sure how much time passed.[lr]::
21246::$$$message_0190_0030_0001$$$::Just as I start to calm down...[lr]::
21247::$$$message_0190_0030_0002$$$::Saber speaks quietly.[lr]::
21248::$$$message_0190_0030_0003$$$::"Kiritsugu was correct. So, he did not betray me."[lr]::
21249::$$$message_0190_0030_0004$$$::Her voice is heavy with regret.::
21250::$$$message_0190_0031_0000$$$::"Saber?"[lr]::
21251::$$$message_0190_0031_0001$$$::"I should never have sought that Holy Grail. No, I never needed the Holy Grail from the beginning. Kiritsugu must have realized that."::
21252::$$$message_0190_0032_0000$$$::It sounds more like a confession.[lr]::
21253::$$$message_0190_0032_0001$$$::Saber is making an apology to someone she can't apologize to. Not anymore.[lr]::
21254::$$$message_0190_0032_0002$$$::She reflects on herself as a way of saying goodbye to the feelings she held for so long.[lr]::
21255::$$$message_0190_0032_0003$$$::Even if she doesn't say it in so many words...[lr]::
21256::$$$message_0190_0032_0004$$$::I understand just by being beside her.::
21257::$$$message_0190_0033_0000$$$::Altria sought the Holy Grail.[lr]::
21258::$$$message_0190_0033_0001$$$::A lonely king who had no choice but to believe that, without the Holy Grail, she could not avoid ruin.[lr]::
21259::$$$message_0190_0033_0002$$$::If only...[lr]::
21260::$$$message_0190_0033_0003$$$::She'd wished to redo everything from the moment she drew the sword from the stone...::
21261::$$$message_0190_0034_0000$$$::"Saber, that's..."[lr]::
21262::$$$message_0190_0034_0001$$$::"I knew all along. I knew I could not just redo everything.[lr]::
21263::$$$message_0190_0034_0002$$$::I knew that, but I kept lying to myself."::
21264::$$$message_0190_0035_0000$$$::But that ends here.[lr]::
21265::$$$message_0190_0035_0001$$$::Her long battle can now really...::
21266::$$$message_0190_0036_0000$$$::"Thank you, Shirou. With your help, I now know the path I must take.[lr]::
21267::$$$message_0190_0036_0001$$$::Yes. The Holy Grail and I are just dreams that should not exist."::
21268::$$$message_0190_0037_0000$$$::But still, she mumbles about wanting to be forgiven.[lr]::
21269::$$$message_0190_0037_0001$$$::She should never have wished for what she did...and in all that time, she'd never been able to fulfill it...[lr]::
21270::$$$message_0190_0037_0002$$$::The weakness was only a fleeting dream.::
21271::$$$message_0190_0038_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21272::$$$message_0190_0038_0001$$$::How should I feel right now?[lr]::
21273::$$$message_0190_0038_0002$$$::What she says is...beautiful.[lr]::
21274::$$$message_0190_0038_0003$$$::Her decision is dignified and proud, just like her.[lr]::
21275::$$$message_0190_0038_0004$$$::She takes pride in her past now, and accepts the end that awaits her.[lr]::
21276::$$$message_0190_0038_0005$$$::And now Saber has...[lr]::
21277::$$$message_0190_0038_0006$$$::She has decided to follow the promise she made until the very end.::
21278::$$$message_0190_0039_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21279::$$$message_0190_0039_0001$$$::She doesn't even need to tell me what that means.[lr]::
21280::$$$message_0190_0039_0002$$$::She will never waver again.[lr]::
21281::$$$message_0190_0039_0003$$$::And she is more beautiful than ever.[lr]::
21282::$$$message_0190_0039_0004$$$::In the dark of that night...in the moment I met her under the moonlight and admired her appearance...I loved her, from the very beginning. ::
21283::$$$message_0190_0040_0000$$$::Then...[lr]::
21284::$$$message_0190_0040_0001$$$::Regardless of what awaits ahead, there's only one thing to be done.::
21285::$$$message_0190_0041_0000$$$::"Saber, let's destroy the Holy Grail."[lr]::
21286::$$$message_0190_0041_0001$$$::I cut away any lingering attachment, I banish my selfishness, and say what has to be done.::
21287::$$$message_0190_0042_0000$$$::"Yes. I knew you would come to that conclusion, Master."::
21288::$$$message_0190_0043_0000$$$::Saber nods reassuringly.[lr]::
21289::$$$message_0190_0043_0001$$$::I can't smile back at her right now.[lr]::
21290::$$$message_0190_0043_0002$$$::I'm trying my best to suppress my feelings for her and convince myself that this is the right thing to do.[lr]::
21291::$$$message_0190_0043_0003$$$::I'm sure that, someday, I'll be proud she trusted me with this decision.::
21292::$$$message_0190_0044_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
21293::$$$message_0190_0044_0001$$$::I stand up.[lr]::
21294::$$$message_0190_0044_0002$$$::Now that's settled, we can't just rest here forever.[lr]::
21295::$$$message_0190_0044_0003$$$::We know what must be done, and our enemy is clear.::
21296::$$$message_0190_0045_0000$$$::No more detours.[lr]::
21297::$$$message_0190_0045_0001$$$::Today...we put an end to this battle.::
