60674::$$$message_0552_0000_0000$$$::Not enough love: Part Two!::
60675::$$$message_0552_0000_0001$$$::Urgh... I thought she'd reformed herself and graduated from this dojo, but she's been reborn as a little devil... Do you think she'll be a real heroine this time, maybe?::
60676::$$$message_0552_0000_0002$$$::...Nah, no way.[lr]::
60677::$$$message_0552_0000_0003$$$::There's just no way!::
60678::$$$message_0552_0000_0004$$$::Even now, she's standing outside the dojo, shivering in her tennis shoes, hoping I'll take her back in, but knowing she can't show her face after talking a big game!::
60679::$$$message_0552_0000_0005$$$::Still, it's pretty cold outside, so I'm sure she'll be back bearing gifts next time.::
60680::$$$message_0552_0000_0006$$$::Anyway, you've reached this Bad End thanks to a lack of affection, once again.::
60681::$$$message_0552_0000_0007$$$::I think it's pretty obvious who you weren't nice enough to. Try being better friends with Illya so that she won't go all-out on you.::
60682::$$$message_0552_0000_0008$$$::The important points are whether you met her on Day 7, and how you chose to apologize to her.::
60683::$$$message_0552_0000_0009$$$::If you still can't see her on Day 7, then start over from Day 5.[lr]::
60684::$$$message_0552_0000_0010$$$::Also, if you see Miss Tohsaka at school, make sure to ask her for advice.::
60685::$$$message_0552_0000_0011$$$::That's all for this episode of Tiger Dojo.[lr]::
60686::$$$message_0552_0000_0012$$$::We hope you enjoy the Sakura route, where you'll meet lots of mysterious new characters and get whiplash from the sudden tone shifts!::
