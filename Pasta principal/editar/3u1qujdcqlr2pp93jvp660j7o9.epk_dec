55537::$$$message_0493_0000_0000$$$::Morning.[lr]::
55538::$$$message_0493_0000_0001$$$::I wake up to sunshine filtering through the paper windows, and notice my neck feels weirdly sluggish.::
55539::$$$message_0493_0001_0000$$$::"Mm..."[lr]::
55540::$$$message_0493_0001_0001$$$::My neck feels this way because my shoulders are stiff.[lr]::
55541::$$$message_0493_0001_0002$$$::I probably strained my neck muscles because I fell asleep on my stomach.::
55542::$$$message_0493_0002_0000$$$::On the other hand, my back injuries seem a lot better.[lr]::
55543::$$$message_0493_0002_0001$$$::They don't hurt anymore, so they shouldn't get in the way of daily life.[lr]::
55544::$$$message_0493_0002_0002$$$::"Oh, crap. It's already past seven."::
55545::$$$message_0493_0003_0000$$$::"Ngh, ow."[lr]::
55546::$$$message_0493_0003_0001$$$::I feel a sudden sting in my abdomen.[lr]::
55547::$$$message_0493_0003_0002$$$::The area where I was punched feels fine when I'm staying still, but sudden movements make it ache.::
55548::$$$message_0493_0004_0000$$$::"It'll probably leave a bruise. This is gonna smart for a while."[lr]::
55549::$$$message_0493_0004_0001$$$::Still, it's nothing I can't put up with.[lr]::
55550::$$$message_0493_0004_0002$$$::The pain isn't bad enough to keep me from moving, so this injury shouldn't get in the way of daily life, either.::
55551::$$$message_0493_0005_0000$$$::I change clothes and leave my bedroom.[lr]::
55552::$$$message_0493_0005_0001$$$::The smell of breakfast wafts out from the living room, so Sakura must be getting things ready for us.::
55553::$$$message_0493_0006_0000$$$::"Morning. Sorry I overslept. Do you still need any help?"[lr]::
55554::$$$message_0493_0006_0001$$$::"Good morning, Senpai. It's unusual for you to sleep in."[lr]::
55555::$$$message_0493_0006_0002$$$::"Oof. My bad. Feels like morning came as soon as I went to bed."::
55556::$$$message_0493_0007_0000$$$::"You're hurt, so there's no helping that. I went to go wake you up earlier, but you didn't respond at all. You must've been exhausted."::
55557::$$$message_0493_0008_0000$$$::Wow.[lr]::
55558::$$$message_0493_0008_0001$$$::I don't even remember Sakura trying to wake me up.[lr]::
55559::$$$message_0493_0008_0002$$$::Not only are my shoulders stiff, my brain isn't even fully awake, apparently.::
55560::$$$message_0493_0009_0000$$$::"Sorry. I'm going to go wash my face. Just hang on, I'll be right back."[lr]::
55561::$$$message_0493_0009_0001$$$::"No, please take your time in the bathroom. I'll set up for breakfast by myself today."[lr]::
55562::$$$message_0493_0009_0002$$$::Sakura really is upbeat today.::
55563::$$$message_0493_0010_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
55564::$$$message_0493_0010_0001$$$::Well, if she insists, then I shouldn't protest any further. It's fine.[lr]::
55565::$$$message_0493_0010_0002$$$::"Okay, well, I'll take my time washing up, then."::
55566::$$$message_0493_0011_0000$$$::"Okay. I'm happy with how the miso soup turned out, so look forward to that!"[lr]::
55567::$$$message_0493_0011_0001$$$::I nod, then cross the living room into the hallway.::
55568::$$$message_0493_0012_0000$$$::"Oh, wait."[lr]::
55569::$$$message_0493_0012_0001$$$::That was strange.[lr]::
55570::$$$message_0493_0012_0002$$$::I just passed by, glad to see her doing well, but still, something was off about[line2]::
55571::$$$message_0493_0013_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
55572::$$$message_0493_0013_0001$$$::I hear something fall.[lr]::
55573::$$$message_0493_0013_0002$$$::I immediately recognize it as the sound of a person collapsing. Maybe I've gotten used to hearing it lately.::
55574::$$$message_0493_0014_0000$$$::"Sakura!"[lr]::
55575::$$$message_0493_0014_0001$$$::I run back to the living room.[lr]::
55576::$$$message_0493_0014_0002$$$::Sakura is drowsily getting up, as if she'd just fallen on the floor.::
55577::$$$message_0493_0015_0000$$$::"Sakura."[lr]::
55578::$$$message_0493_0015_0001$$$::I support her unsteady body.::
55579::$$$message_0493_0016_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
55580::$$$message_0493_0016_0001$$$::I can feel the heat off her body, just like I did before.[lr]::
55581::$$$message_0493_0016_0002$$$::Her ragged breathing and the sweat soaking through her shirt are obvious symptoms of a fever.::
55582::$$$message_0493_0017_0000$$$::"Ah...S-Senpai."[lr]::
55583::$$$message_0493_0017_0001$$$::She finally notices me.[lr]::
55584::$$$message_0493_0017_0002$$$::Sakura looks at me with unfocused eyes.::
55585::$$$message_0493_0018_0000$$$::"I said you could take your time, but you came so quickly. Um, hold on just a minute. I'll get breakfast ready."[lr]::
55586::$$$message_0493_0018_0001$$$::Beaming at me, she untangles herself from my arms.::
55587::$$$message_0493_0019_0000$$$::"Sakura, you..."[lr]::
55588::$$$message_0493_0019_0001$$$::Rather than pushing herself to do it, Sakura doesn't seem to have noticed her own fever.::
55589::$$$message_0493_0020_0000$$$::"Hold on. Don't worry about breakfast. You need to go back to your room and lie down. You have a really bad fever."[lr]::
55590::$$$message_0493_0020_0001$$$::"Huh...? Me?"::
55591::$$$message_0493_0021_0000$$$::"Yeah. Damn it, the fact you didn't even notice is a bad symptom! Damn it, why..."[lr]::
55592::$$$message_0493_0021_0001$$$::Why didn't I notice it sooner?[lr]::
55593::$$$message_0493_0021_0002$$$::Even if I'm sad about Saber, I should have paid more attention to Sakura's condition who's still right by me. What's wrong with me?::
55594::$$$message_0493_0022_0000$$$::"Um, Senpai? I'm okay, really. I just tripped, I'm not really dizzy or anything..."::
55595::$$$message_0493_0023_0000$$$::"Don't be stupid! You have a really high fever! I can tell even without using a thermometer!"::
55596::$$$message_0493_0024_0000$$$::"Ah..."::
55597::$$$message_0493_0025_0000$$$::I lead her to the guestroom.[lr]::
55598::$$$message_0493_0025_0001$$$::I need to let Sakura rest.[lr]::
55599::$$$message_0493_0025_0002$$$::I'll let the school know she's out sick, make something easy to digest for breakfast, and for lunch...right, I'll ask Grandpa Fujimura to send a caretaker over.::
55600::$$$message_0493_0026_0000$$$::"U-um, Senpai, where are you going? You should make sure to eat before you leave for school."::
55601::$$$message_0493_0027_0000$$$::Sakura still doesn't understand what's happening.[lr]::
55602::$$$message_0493_0027_0001$$$::Maybe she's so excited because her fever is making her delirious.::
55603::$$$message_0493_0028_0000$$$::"You're taking the day off. I want you to stay in your room all day. I'll let the school know. I'm going to see Fuji-nee there anyway, so I can just tell her then."::
55604::$$$message_0493_0029_0000$$$::"Huh? I'm not going to school today?"[lr]::
55605::$$$message_0493_0029_0001$$$::"That's right. Who else would I be talking about? I...might still be hurt, but I feel fine. I don't have any reason to be absent."[lr]::
55606::$$$message_0493_0029_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
55607::$$$message_0493_0030_0000$$$::...No, I don't have a good reason to make myself go to school, either. Without Saber, it's too risky to go alone.[lr]::
55608::$$$message_0493_0030_0001$$$::But still, I need to be there today.[lr]::
55609::$$$message_0493_0030_0002$$$::I need to report what happened with Zouken and Assassin to Tohsaka. I can't stay holed up here.::
55610::$$$message_0493_0031_0000$$$::"Anyway, you need to rest, Sakura. You're always working hard, so you should rest hard, too. I'll be home as soon as I take care of some business."::
55611::$$$message_0493_0032_0000$$$::"Ah. N-no, I'm okay, really![lr]::
55612::$$$message_0493_0032_0001$$$::So let's have breakfast and go to school together. If we do that, my fever will get well right away!"[lr]::
55613::$$$message_0493_0032_0002$$$::"Of course it won't, silly. You're acting crazy, Sakura."::
55614::$$$message_0493_0033_0000$$$::"I'm not crazy![lr]::
55615::$$$message_0493_0033_0001$$$::You're the one being unreasonable. I feel fine and I don't have a fever, but you're still injured! So I can't be the only one...resting..."[lr]::
55616::$$$message_0493_0033_0002$$$::"Eh, whoa, Sakura!"::
55617::$$$message_0493_0034_0000$$$::"Huh...? That's weird. It's kinda...hard to breathe..."[lr]::
55618::$$$message_0493_0034_0001$$$::Sakura nearly falls to the floor, panting.::
55619::$$$message_0493_0035_0000$$$::...Her body feels strangely heavy in my arms.[lr]::
55620::$$$message_0493_0035_0001$$$::Does she lack the strength to stand, or is she collapsed because she suddenly got so heavy?[lr]::
55621::$$$message_0493_0035_0002$$$::Either way, she has a fever that prevents her from walking around on her own, even if she believes otherwise.::
55622::$$$message_0493_0036_0000$$$::"...Idiot. Listen, I'm making you rest at home today, no matter what. Be mad at me if you want, but if you strain yourself this much, you'll end up needing to stay home tomorrow, too."::
55623::$$$message_0493_0037_0000$$$::"...But Senpai, I need to go to school."[lr]::
55624::$$$message_0493_0037_0001$$$::Sakura mumbles incoherently, her breathing unsteady.[lr]::
55625::$$$message_0493_0037_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55626::$$$message_0493_0037_0003$$$::I ignore it and carry her to her bedroom.::
55627::$$$message_0493_0038_0000$$$::By the time we arrive, Sakura's already asleep.[lr]::
55628::$$$message_0493_0038_0001$$$::Or rather, she's still in a half-conscsious state, her breathing labored.[lr]::
55629::$$$message_0493_0038_0002$$$::Just once, she firmly grabs hold of the arms I'm carrying her with.::
55630::$$$message_0493_0039_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55631::$$$message_0493_0039_0001$$$::Anyway, I'll tuck her into bed.[lr]::
55632::$$$message_0493_0039_0002$$$::"Ah...Sen...pai...?"[lr]::
55633::$$$message_0493_0039_0003$$$::Her voice is unfocused.[lr]::
55634::$$$message_0493_0039_0004$$$::Her eyes are on the ceiling, not seeing me.::
55635::$$$message_0493_0040_0000$$$::"Sakura."[lr]::
55636::$$$message_0493_0040_0001$$$::Her ragged breathing, her flushed cheeks, her damp shirt sticking to her skin, the anguished rise and fall of her chest with each breath.::
55637::$$$message_0493_0041_0000$$$::"Argh."[lr]::
55638::$$$message_0493_0041_0001$$$::The sight is so enchanting, I turn away in a hurry.[lr]::
55639::$$$message_0493_0041_0002$$$::Sakura's the one suffering from a fever, so why am I acting so inappropriately!?::
55640::$$$message_0493_0042_0000$$$::"...Yeah, I'd better call for a caretaker."[lr]::
55641::$$$message_0493_0042_0001$$$::I can't change Sakura's clothes, much less clean her body.::
55642::$$$message_0493_0043_0000$$$::Thankfully, her breathing stabilizes once she's in bed, so now I just need to wait for her fever to break.[lr]::
55643::$$$message_0493_0043_0001$$$::Once she can walk on her own, I'll take her to the hospital and get some medicine prescribed.::
55644::$$$message_0493_0044_0000$$$::"Sakura. I'm going to call someone to come help, so get some sleep. I think you'll be comfortable with one of the caretakers from Fuji-nee's place."[lr]::
55645::$$$message_0493_0044_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
55646::$$$message_0493_0044_0002$$$::She doesn't answer.[lr]::
55647::$$$message_0493_0044_0003$$$::Her breathing is still labored, but at least she's sleeping.::
55648::$$$message_0493_0045_0000$$$::"Phew. You were so assertive today. Why do you want to go to school so badly?"[lr]::
55649::$$$message_0493_0045_0001$$$::I talk out loud to myself.[lr]::
55650::$$$message_0493_0045_0002$$$::Sakura's asleep, so I know she won't answer.::
55651::$$$message_0493_0046_0000$$$::"See ya. I'm off to school."[lr]::
55652::$$$message_0493_0046_0001$$$::I get up and head for the door.[lr]::
55653::$$$message_0493_0046_0002$$$::Just as I do...[lr]::
55654::$$$message_0493_0046_0003$$$::"...I want to go to school with you, Senpai."[lr]::
55655::$$$message_0493_0046_0004$$$::I hear a reply.::
55656::$$$message_0493_0047_0000$$$::"Sakura...?"[lr]::
55657::$$$message_0493_0047_0001$$$::I turn around.[lr]::
55658::$$$message_0493_0047_0002$$$::Sakura's still asleep, but with a worried frown.[lr]::
55659::$$$message_0493_0047_0003$$$::"...Oh, you were just sleep-talking."::
55660::$$$message_0493_0048_0000$$$::I leave the guestroom this time.[lr]::
55661::$$$message_0493_0048_0001$$$::But as I do...::
55662::$$$message_0493_0049_0000$$$::"...I have to protect you, Senpai."::
55663::$$$message_0493_0050_0000$$$::I hear her say something in her fever dream.::
55664::$$$message_0493_0051_0000$$$::On the way to school, I stop by Fuji-nee's house and ask for a caretaker.[lr]::
55665::$$$message_0493_0051_0001$$$::I sometimes forget because Fuji-nee doesn't make a big deal out of it, but the Fujimura residence is one of the most extravagant homes in our neighborhood.::
55666::$$$message_0493_0052_0000$$$::It isn't a company, yet there are dozens of fierce-looking men who call themselves "employees."[lr]::
55667::$$$message_0493_0052_0001$$$::Most of them live in a separate building on the compound, but anyway, it's a huge family.[lr]::
55668::$$$message_0493_0052_0002$$$::They also employ an appropriate number of workers, so I can ask them to lend me a caretaker who's available.::
55669::$$$message_0493_0053_0000$$$::   Then...[lr]::
55670::$$$message_0493_0053_0001$$$::I have them send over an emergency housekeeper that's helped me a number of times in the past before Sakura started coming around.[lr]::
55671::$$$message_0493_0053_0002$$$::Sakura's acquainted with them too, so I feel comfortable leaving her to them.::
