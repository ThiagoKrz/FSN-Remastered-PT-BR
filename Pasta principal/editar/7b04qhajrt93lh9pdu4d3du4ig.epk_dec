17085::$$$message_0157_0000_0000$$$::"Yeah. Illya's here too, so let's have lunch early today."[lr]::
17086::$$$message_0157_0000_0001$$$::I agree to Saber's suggestion, and lower my shinai.[lr]::
17087::$$$message_0157_0000_0002$$$::And then...[lr]::
17088::$$$message_0157_0000_0003$$$::Saber's shoulders sag in relief.::
17089::$$$message_0157_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]What's really going on?[font italic=false][lr]::
17090::$$$message_0157_0001_0001$$$::She's acting so weird.[lr]::
17091::$$$message_0157_0001_0002$$$::Maybe I should at least ask why.::
17092::$$$message_0157_0002_0000$$$::"What a relief. Then let us all head to the living room.[lr]::
17093::$$$message_0157_0002_0001$$$::Shirou's cooking is delicious, but takes a while to prepare."::
17094::$$$message_0157_0003_0000$$$::"Huh? Do you think the time I spend working on lunch is wasted time?[lr]::
17095::$$$message_0157_0003_0001$$$::I guess I should have made bento for lunch every day. That would've been much easier and less time-consuming. And I wouldn't have to be in the kitchen every time, either."[lr]::
17096::$$$message_0157_0003_0002$$$::I put all that work into lunch as a way of thanking her, but if Saber doesn't like me spending so much time on that, so be it.::
17097::$$$message_0157_0004_0000$$$::"Shirou...? What are you doing? Let us head to the living room."[lr]::
17098::$$$message_0157_0004_0001$$$::"What? Oh, yeah... Lunch, right?"[lr]::
17099::$$$message_0157_0004_0002$$$::I lean my shinai against the wall and set three cushions on the floor.::
17100::$$$message_0157_0005_0000$$$::"Yes, lunch! We will be taking a break afterwards, but we will have a problem if you don't head to the kitchen right away!"[lr]::
17101::$$$message_0157_0005_0001$$$::"Why? We don't need to go back to the living room, and we don't need to rush. What would be the problem?"::
17102::$$$message_0157_0006_0000$$$::"Uh..."[lr]::
17103::$$$message_0157_0006_0001$$$::Saber stops so suddenly, I can practically hear gears grinding.::
17104::$$$message_0157_0007_0000$$$::"And how come today, of all days, you're so insistent about stopping on time?[lr]::
17105::$$$message_0157_0007_0001$$$::What's got you in such a hurry?"[lr]::
17106::$$$message_0157_0007_0002$$$::"N-no. It's not that I'm in a rush, but..."::
17107::$$$message_0157_0008_0000$$$::"Then we can enjoy a nice, leisurely lunch since we have time."[lr]::
17108::$$$message_0157_0008_0001$$$::"Um...well, that may be true, but..."::
17109::$$$message_0157_0009_0000$$$::"A-anyway, w-we must move to the living room! If we do not eat lunch, it will affect our afternoon training!"[lr]::
17110::$$$message_0157_0009_0001$$$::"And I said I already prepared it. If you've got the time, then you can go to the living room and bring back the bento I made this morning!"::
17111::$$$message_0157_0010_0000$$$::"Huh? Bento...?"[lr]::
17112::$$$message_0157_0010_0001$$$::I nod as I open the windows to let in the cool air.[lr]::
17113::$$$message_0157_0010_0002$$$::And then...[lr]::
17114::$$$message_0157_0010_0003$$$::...our stomachs growl, signaling that we're both hungry.::
17115::$$$message_0157_0011_0000$$$::"Oh right. We always let out stomachs growling be our meal alarm. No wonder it seemed weird."[lr]::
17116::$$$message_0157_0011_0001$$$::I turn to Saber.::
17117::$$$message_0157_0012_0000$$$::"Hm? What's wrong, Saber? Did opening the window make it too cold?"[lr]::
17118::$$$message_0157_0012_0001$$$::We should at least ventilate the room since we're eating here, though.::
17119::$$$message_0157_0013_0000$$$::"N-no! It is nothing! D-did you say lunch is in the living room?"[lr]::
17120::$$$message_0157_0013_0001$$$::Saber dashes out of the dojo.::
17121::$$$message_0157_0014_0000$$$::"What was that all about?"[lr]::
17122::$$$message_0157_0014_0001$$$::Saber's half-hearted hits...the way she acted now... Maybe she does have a fever... ::ǆ
