73027::$$$message_0669_0000_0001$$$::His palm slams into me.[lr]::
73028::$$$message_0669_0000_0002$$$::That doesn't change, no matter how my body has changed.[lr]::
73029::$$$message_0669_0000_0003$$$::His attack, aimed at doing internal rather than external damage, ruthlessly sends shockwaves through me.::
73030::$$$message_0669_0001_0000$$$::The battle is overwhelming.[lr]::
73031::$$$message_0669_0001_0001$$$::The enemy dodges, repels, and traps my fists, all while making me eat all of his attacks.[lr]::
73032::$$$message_0669_0001_0002$$$::Pure white mangles my vision every time Kotomine's fists [font italic=true]clang[font italic=false] off my body.::
73033::$$$message_0669_0002_0000$$$::It isn't the damage from his attacks, but from the pain of my left arm repairing and overwriting my injured body.::
73034::$$$message_0669_0003_0000$$$::"......"[lr]::
73035::$$$message_0669_0003_0001$$$::I protect my head.[lr]::

73037::$$$message_0669_0003_0003$$$::This could end with a single blow to my head.[lr]::
73038::$$$message_0669_0003_0004$$$::I can't hit him with my fists, so I use both arms to protect my head.::
73039::$$$message_0669_0004_0000$$$::My sense of pain is long gone, and my eyesight is about to blink out, too.[lr]::
73040::$$$message_0669_0004_0001$$$::The pain transmitted to my brain comes only from the left arm's invasion of my body.[lr]::
73041::$$$message_0669_0004_0002$$$::His bloody fists pulverize every square centimeter of my frame.[lr]::
73042::$$$message_0669_0004_0003$$$::I work my left arm to try and repair it, and[line2]::
73043::$$$message_0669_0005_0000$$$::Everything goes white.[lr]::
73044::$$$message_0669_0005_0001$$$::Images and memories become irreturnably white.::
73045::$$$message_0669_0006_0000$$$::"......"[lr]::
73046::$$$message_0669_0006_0001$$$::It hurts even to think now.[lr]::
73047::$$$message_0669_0006_0002$$$::I sprout blades to protect my destroyed body from dying.[lr]::
73048::$$$message_0669_0006_0003$$$::In exchange, my brain is shaved away.[lr]::
73049::$$$message_0669_0006_0004$$$::Which of us will end first?::
73050::$$$message_0669_0007_0000$$$::"Ngh... Guh, fuuhhh...!"[lr]::
73051::$$$message_0669_0007_0001$$$::His fists and bones are broken.[lr]::
73052::$$$message_0669_0007_0002$$$::He endures it, his face twisted in pain, and continues striking me.::
73053::$$$message_0669_0008_0000$$$::"......"[lr]::
73054::$$$message_0669_0008_0001$$$::I dodge the blows and attack with my right fist.[lr]::
73055::$$$message_0669_0008_0002$$$::It gets blocked.[lr]::
73056::$$$message_0669_0008_0003$$$::There's a simultaneous impact to my left armpit. I endure the blades stabbing my brain and attack again.::
73057::$$$message_0669_0009_0000$$$::"......"[lr]::
73058::$$$message_0669_0009_0001$$$::I can still...[lr]::

73063::$$$message_0669_0011_0001$$$::My body shouldn't be able to feel pain anymore, but I nearly weep at the pain throughout my body.[lr]::
73064::$$$message_0669_0011_0002$$$::I'm flung back, crashing into a fallen boulder, and barely stop myself from going over the cliff.::
73065::$$$message_0669_0012_0000$$$::"...Ah."[lr]::

73075::$$$message_0669_0015_0001$$$::The enemy walks over.[lr]::
73076::$$$message_0669_0015_0002$$$::...He can't run anymore, either.[lr]::
73077::$$$message_0669_0015_0003$$$::It wouldn't surprise me if we both disappeared one minute from now.[lr]::
73078::$$$message_0669_0015_0004$$$::Then...I'm...::
73079::$$$message_0669_0016_0000$$$::"Ah."[lr]::
73080::$$$message_0669_0016_0001$$$::You swore an oath.[lr]::

73089::$$$message_0669_0019_0001$$$::The enemy approaches.[lr]::
73090::$$$message_0669_0019_0002$$$::He drags his feet toward me to crush my head.::
73091::$$$message_0669_0020_0000$$$::    Like hell![lr]::
73092::$$$message_0669_0020_0001$$$::I won't lose, this man doesn't have a goal, he's just living the only way he knows how...![lr]::
73093::$$$message_0669_0020_0002$$$::But I have it.[lr]::
73094::$$$message_0669_0020_0003$$$::I have a goal.[lr]::

73098::$$$message_0669_0021_0002$$$::[line5]'s been crying in a place I don't know.[lr]::
73099::$$$message_0669_0021_0003$$$::She always cried alone, and only ever smiled in front of me.::
73100::$$$message_0669_0022_0000$$$::"Ah... oh"[lr]::
73101::$$$message_0669_0022_0001$$$::...That's right.[lr]::
73102::$$$message_0669_0022_0002$$$::So I have to protect her.[lr]::
73103::$$$message_0669_0022_0003$$$::I'll protect [line5] from the sins she committed, the sins blaming her, and the sins she remembers.::
73104::$$$message_0669_0023_0000$$$::The girl who could only smile in front of me.[lr]::

73130::$$$message_0669_0030_0001$$$::Damn it, that's right, he won't let me hit him that easily, and he's many times stronger than me...[lr]::
73131::$$$message_0669_0030_0002$$$::So of course he'll parry my attacks effortlessly and come to finish me off!::

73136::$$$message_0669_0031_0004$$$::The enemy knocks me to the ground and comes to crush my head.[lr]::
73137::$$$message_0669_0031_0005$$$::I'll lose. I'll lose. I'll lose. I'll lose.[lr]::
73138::$$$message_0669_0031_0006$$$::That much is self-evident.[lr]::
73139::$$$message_0669_0031_0007$$$::But I can still move my body...!::
73140::$$$message_0669_0032_0000$$$::"KOTOMI..."[lr]::
73141::$$$message_0669_0032_0001$$$::The enemy's shadow looms over me, blocking my path.[lr]::
73142::$$$message_0669_0032_0002$$$::And then, I take my disobedient legs[line2]yeah, my right leg won't even budge[line2]and ignite them into motion.::
73143::$$$message_0669_0033_0000$$$::It's not going to end here.[lr]::

73146::$$$message_0669_0034_0000$$$::"...NE?"[lr]::
73147::$$$message_0669_0034_0001$$$::The man in front of me stops,[lr]::
73148::$$$message_0669_0034_0002$$$::his extended fist not quite reaching my face.::
73149::$$$message_0669_0035_0000$$$::"...So this is how it ends. A simple difference in our remaining time."[lr]::
73150::$$$message_0669_0035_0001$$$::He looks down at his own chest.[lr]::
73151::$$$message_0669_0035_0002$$$::The dark stained area is where his heart should be.[lr]::
73152::$$$message_0669_0035_0003$$$::...A different in time.[lr]::
73153::$$$message_0669_0035_0004$$$::He must have started dying just slightly before me in the forest.::
