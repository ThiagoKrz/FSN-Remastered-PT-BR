54098::$$$message_0474_0000_0000$$$::...No, I shouldn't tell her.[lr]::
54099::$$$message_0474_0000_0001$$$::This is my own problem.[lr]::
54100::$$$message_0474_0000_0002$$$::I chose to keep fighting.::
54101::$$$message_0474_0001_0000$$$::Zouken Matou and Assassin...[lr]::
54102::$$$message_0474_0001_0001$$$::The black Shadow roaming the town...[lr]::
54103::$$$message_0474_0001_0002$$$::Masters fighting each other over the Holy Grail...[lr]::
54104::$$$message_0474_0001_0003$$$::I lost Saber in my fight to put a stop to all that.[lr]::
54105::$$$message_0474_0001_0004$$$::...I can't lose anyone else.[lr]::
54106::$$$message_0474_0001_0005$$$::From here on out, I have to fight on my own.::
54107::$$$message_0474_0002_0000$$$::"Emiya...? Why are you all quiet?[lr]::
54108::$$$message_0474_0002_0001$$$::Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?"::
54109::$$$message_0474_0003_0000$$$::"No, that's everything. I lost Saber, and I'm no longer a Master. We don't have any reason to fight now."::
54110::$$$message_0474_0004_0000$$$::"Yeah. If you're going to forfeit the war, then that means we won't become enemies once our alliance is over... Bye, Emiya."[lr]::
54111::$$$message_0474_0004_0001$$$::"Yeah. I'm forfeiting now. Without Saber, I don't have a chance."::
54112::$$$message_0474_0005_0000$$$::I leave my seat.[lr]::
54113::$$$message_0474_0005_0001$$$::I head for the exit, leaving Tohsaka behind.::
54114::$$$message_0474_0006_0000$$$::"Bye, Tohsaka. Be careful around Zouken."[lr]::
54115::$$$message_0474_0006_0001$$$::"Emiya, hold on[line2]"[lr]::
54116::$$$message_0474_0006_0002$$$::I open the door without turning back.[lr]::
54117::$$$message_0474_0006_0003$$$::I leave the roof, as if to sever my ties.::
54118::$$$message_0474_0007_0000$$$::   The day ends.[lr]::
54119::$$$message_0474_0007_0001$$$::If I'm going to trail the Shadow and Zouken, I'll have to start tonight.[lr]::
54120::$$$message_0474_0007_0002$$$::With my lack of fighting strength, what I need now is a weapon and reliable intelligence.[lr]::
54121::$$$message_0474_0007_0003$$$::I'll wait for night and then infiltrate Ryudou Temple or the Matou residence and look for clues.::
54122::$$$message_0474_0008_0000$$$::"I need to look after Sakura too. I'll wait until tonight."[lr]::
54123::$$$message_0474_0008_0001$$$::The war will continue once night falls.[lr]::
54124::$$$message_0474_0008_0002$$$::Until then, I'll give Sakura my undivided attention.[lr]::
54125::$$$message_0474_0008_0003$$$::...There's still time until then, so I'll pick up several days' worth of supplies on the way home.::
54126::$$$message_0474_0009_0000$$$::"I'm home!"[lr]::
54127::$$$message_0474_0009_0001$$$::I announce myself as I enter the house.::
54128::$$$message_0474_0010_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
54129::$$$message_0474_0010_0001$$$::But...[lr]::
54130::$$$message_0474_0010_0002$$$::A sense of discomfort overcomes me as soon as I enter.::
54131::$$$message_0474_0011_0000$$$::"Footprints?"[lr]::
54132::$$$message_0474_0011_0001$$$::In the hallway, I see marks that look like footprints.[lr]::
54133::$$$message_0474_0011_0002$$$::There are traces of someone tracking dirt into the house, while the house itself feels empty.[lr]::
54134::$$$message_0474_0011_0003$$$::Only Sakura's shoes are out front, so the housekeeper I asked for must have gone home.::
54135::$$$message_0474_0012_0000$$$::"Sakura?"[lr]::
54136::$$$message_0474_0012_0001$$$::I go to the guest bedroom.[lr]::
54137::$$$message_0474_0012_0002$$$::Nobody's inside.[lr]::
54138::$$$message_0474_0012_0003$$$::Discomfort turns to dread.::
54139::$$$message_0474_0013_0000$$$::I go back to the living room.[lr]::
54140::$$$message_0474_0013_0001$$$::Sakura isn't here, either.[lr]::
54141::$$$message_0474_0013_0002$$$::The tracks in the hallway end in the living room.[lr]::
54142::$$$message_0474_0013_0003$$$::Someone with dirty feet did something here and then went outside.::
54143::$$$message_0474_0014_0000$$$::   I have a hunch.[lr]::
54144::$$$message_0474_0014_0001$$$::Sakura was just here.[lr]::
54145::$$$message_0474_0014_0002$$$::She was here in the waiting room, waiting for me to come home.::
54146::$$$message_0474_0015_0000$$$::The dirty footprints belong to an intruder.[lr]::
54147::$$$message_0474_0015_0001$$$::Sakura should be resting in bed, but she isn't here.::
54148::$$$message_0474_0016_0000$$$::That's all I know.[lr]::
54149::$$$message_0474_0016_0001$$$::It's strange that I haven't deduced the situation.[lr]::
54150::$$$message_0474_0016_0002$$$::The answer should be clear, once I take some time to think.[lr]::
54151::$$$message_0474_0016_0003$$$::Calmly.[lr]::
54152::$$$message_0474_0016_0004$$$::Calmly.[lr]::
54153::$$$message_0474_0016_0005$$$::Calmly.[lr]::
54154::$$$message_0474_0016_0006$$$::If I calm down and think, I'll figure out what happened here.::
54155::$$$message_0474_0017_0000$$$::But why...[lr]::
54156::$$$message_0474_0017_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
54157::$$$message_0474_0017_0002$$$::Why won't my brain work at all?::
54158::$$$message_0474_0018_0000$$$::I should have come home earlier.[lr]::
54159::$$$message_0474_0018_0001$$$::I should have taken this more seriously.[lr]::
54160::$$$message_0474_0018_0002$$$::Didn't I take Sakura in because I was afraid this would happen?::
54161::$$$message_0474_0019_0000$$$::Zouken said that Sakura had nothing to do with this.[lr]::
54162::$$$message_0474_0019_0001$$$::Why did I believe him?[lr]::
54163::$$$message_0474_0019_0002$$$::As long as Sakura's one of the Matous, there's no way she isn't related.::
54164::$$$message_0474_0020_0000$$$::So, why?[lr]::
54165::$$$message_0474_0020_0001$$$::Why did I accept an explanation that was convenient for me, without questioning it at all!?::
54166::$$$message_0474_0021_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
54167::$$$message_0474_0021_0001$$$::The telephone rings.[lr]::
54168::$$$message_0474_0021_0002$$$::I mechanically answer the phone, my mind blank.[lr]::
54169::$$$message_0474_0021_0003$$$::"Hello? You finally home, Emiya?"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
54170::$$$message_0474_0021_0004$$$::Shinji's voice comes over the speaker, his tone pleasant.::
54171::$$$message_0474_0022_0000$$$::"What did you do to Sakura?"[lr]::
54172::$$$message_0474_0022_0001$$$::"Huh? Oh, I called you because I thought you'd be sad with her gone. You're really quick, Emiya. That's amazing. You figured this all out before I even said anything."::
54173::$$$message_0474_0023_0000$$$::"Shut up. What did you do to Sakura?"[lr]::
54174::$$$message_0474_0023_0001$$$::"Huh? I came to pick her up. She's my sister, so I can't leave her at some other guy's house."::
54175::$$$message_0474_0024_0000$$$::"Shinji."[lr]::
54176::$$$message_0474_0024_0001$$$::"Haha! Nice, you're getting pissed! I bet you're frustrated that I took her back!"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
54177::$$$message_0474_0024_0002$$$::Frustrated...?[lr]::
54178::$$$message_0474_0024_0003$$$::No way. I don't have useless emotions like that right now.::
54179::$$$message_0474_0025_0000$$$::"Enough beating around the bush. Tell me what you want."[lr]::
54180::$$$message_0474_0025_0001$$$::"Heh! I bet you know. Let's settle things, Emiya. I bet you think we aren't finished yet, after last time."::
54181::$$$message_0474_0026_0000$$$::"No, we are. You ran away. There's nothing left to settle."::
54182::$$$message_0474_0027_0000$$$::"You still don't get it! That was only because of the difference in our Servants, not you! I never would've run if you didn't have Saber! I never would've lost if Saber hadn't shown up!"::
54183::$$$message_0474_0028_0000$$$::If Saber hadn't shown up?[lr]::
54184::$$$message_0474_0028_0001$$$::...I see. It sounds like Rider hasn't told him that I lost Saber.[lr]::
54185::$$$message_0474_0028_0002$$$::I don't know if she withheld that on purpose, but Shinji still thinks I'm a Master.[lr]::
54186::$$$message_0474_0028_0003$$$::Yeah...that's why he came to take her back by force.[lr]::
54187::$$$message_0474_0028_0004$$$::In other words, this phone call is...::
54188::$$$message_0474_0029_0000$$$::"Shinji. What are you going to do with her?"[lr]::
54189::$$$message_0474_0029_0001$$$::"Don't get all heavy on me, man. I won't do anything to my precious sister.[lr]::
54190::$$$message_0474_0029_0002$$$::Not if you come to see me, alone."::
54191::$$$message_0474_0030_0000$$$::"You're telling me to fight you without Saber?"::
54192::$$$message_0474_0031_0000$$$::"Whew! You're awfully feisty today, Emiya. Come to the school, all right? I'll bring Sakura if you come alone.[lr]::
54193::$$$message_0474_0031_0001$$$::...Oh, but don't try anything stupid. Rider's Bounded Field is on the school. If you bring Saber, I'll know right away.[lr]::
54194::$$$message_0474_0031_0002$$$::Of course...I bet you wouldn't do anything so cowardly in front of Sakura."::
54195::$$$message_0474_0032_0000$$$::I hear snickering over the receiver.::
54196::$$$message_0474_0033_0000$$$::"I'll be right there, so wait. Don't lay a hand on Sakura."[lr]::
54197::$$$message_0474_0033_0001$$$::"Sure thing. Come here as soon as you can.[lr]::
54198::$$$message_0474_0033_0002$$$::You sure took your time getting home, though.[lr]::
54199::$$$message_0474_0033_0003$$$::Can you believe this guy, making my precious sister wait?"::
54200::$$$message_0474_0034_0000$$$::"What did you do to her, Shinji?"[lr]::
54201::$$$message_0474_0034_0001$$$::"Nothing. It's actually taking everything I can just to keep Rider under control. It's just like that night. She's a real handful, and she's been looking like she spotted a tasty snack..."[wsay canskip=1]::
54202::$$$message_0474_0035_0000$$$::I slam down the receiver.[lr]::
54203::$$$message_0474_0035_0001$$$::"Why didn't he come to me?"[lr]::
54204::$$$message_0474_0035_0002$$$::His laughing still rings in my ears.[lr]::
54205::$$$message_0474_0035_0003$$$::I set off running, nerves ablaze with rage.::
54206::$$$message_0474_0036_0000$$$::I go outside.[lr]::
54207::$$$message_0474_0036_0001$$$::The sky above is dark, and the sun's starting to set.[lr]::
54208::$$$message_0474_0036_0002$$$::It's definitely going to rain tonight.[lr]::
54209::$$$message_0474_0036_0003$$$::I need to bring Sakura back with me before then.::
54210::$$$message_0474_0037_0000$$$::There's no sign of anyone on campus.[lr]::
54211::$$$message_0474_0037_0001$$$::School has been sending students home early ever since the mass comas spread.[lr]::
54212::$$$message_0474_0037_0002$$$::Now after 5:00 PM, there probably aren't even any teachers still on campus, let alone students.::
54213::$$$message_0474_0038_0000$$$::    I feel hot iron enter my back.[lr]::
54214::$$$message_0474_0038_0001$$$::I've already activated my Magic Circuit.[lr]::
54215::$$$message_0474_0038_0002$$$::I focus on making my only weapon, Strengthening, ready to use at any time.::
54216::$$$message_0474_0039_0000$$$::    Is it Rider's Bounded Field, I wonder?[lr]::
54217::$$$message_0474_0039_0001$$$::The campus is colored a deep red, and each breath hurts my lungs.[lr]::
54218::$$$message_0474_0039_0002$$$::I cought violently, spitting blood.[lr]::
54219::$$$message_0474_0039_0003$$$::Paying it no mind, I run up the stairs.::
54220::$$$message_0474_0040_0000$$$::I have a feeling I know what I'll find, even if I'm not sure.[lr]::
54221::$$$message_0474_0040_0001$$$::Knowing Shinji, he'll be waiting somewhere familiar to him.[lr]::
54222::$$$message_0474_0040_0002$$$::He'll be in a classroom on the third floor.::
54223::$$$message_0474_0041_0000$$$::I head up to the third floor.[lr]::
54224::$$$message_0474_0041_0001$$$::The red filter only seems to darken, and I feel magical energy being shaved off me with each step.::
54225::$$$message_0474_0042_0000$$$::Is he waiting for me?[lr]::
54226::$$$message_0474_0042_0001$$$::I find Shinji watching me in front of class 2-C.::
54227::$$$message_0474_0043_0000$$$::"Shinji...!"[lr]::
54228::$$$message_0474_0043_0001$$$::"Ha! You're finally here, Emiya!"::
54229::$$$message_0474_0044_0000$$$::My mind goes white-hot with anger.[lr]::
54230::$$$message_0474_0044_0001$$$::   Is Sakura inside the classroom?[lr]::
54231::$$$message_0474_0044_0002$$$::I need to make sure she's safe as soon as possible.[lr]::
54232::$$$message_0474_0044_0003$$$::If Shinji's going to stand in my way, I'll...::
54233::$$$message_0474_0045_0000$$$::"You're up, Rider. This is the Master of Saber, who cut you open! Pay him back for that night!"[lr]::
54234::$$$message_0474_0045_0001$$$::A dark Servant blocks my path.[lr]::
54235::$$$message_0474_0045_0002$$$::   I don't care.[lr]::
54236::$$$message_0474_0045_0003$$$::I can't stop, no matter who it is.::
54237::$$$message_0474_0046_0000$$$::   Daggers are swung at me.[lr]::
54238::$$$message_0474_0046_0001$$$::I predict and evade them so quickly it surprises myself.[lr]::
54239::$$$message_0474_0046_0002$$$::I move past Rider's left flank, avoiding an upward cut.[lr]::
54240::$$$message_0474_0046_0003$$$::Rider doesn't catch me as I pass her. Maybe her long hair or stature makes that difficult.::
54241::$$$message_0474_0047_0000$$$::   I've got him.[lr]::
54242::$$$message_0474_0047_0001$$$::I'm five meters from Shinji. I can close the distance in two seconds and target the Command Spell controlling Rider[line2][lr]::
54243::$$$message_0474_0047_0002$$$::"...!?!?"[lr]::
54244::$$$message_0474_0047_0003$$$::I gag.[lr]::
54245::$$$message_0474_0047_0004$$$::Something grabs me around the neck from behind.::
54246::$$$message_0474_0048_0000$$$::"Phew. What the hell are you doing, Rider!? You let Emiya do whatever he wants! And you call yourself a Servant!?"[lr]::
54247::$$$message_0474_0048_0001$$$::"...I apologize. I lost focus for a moment."::
54248::$$$message_0474_0048_0002$$$::   I hear Rider right behind me.[lr]::
54249::$$$message_0474_0048_0003$$$::"Guh... Kuh, argh...!"[lr]::
54250::$$$message_0474_0048_0004$$$::My feet can't touch the ground.[lr]::
54251::$$$message_0474_0048_0005$$$::Rider's chains are around my neck, lifting me up.::
54252::$$$message_0474_0048_0006$$$::"Hah... Gah, guh...!"[lr]::
54253::$$$message_0474_0048_0007$$$::I try to resist, but I can't get a foothold.[lr]::
54254::$$$message_0474_0048_0008$$$::Rider is behind me. I can't see my enemy. She's wringing my neck, I can't[line2]::
54255::$$$message_0474_0048_0009$$$::"Your lack of calm has lost you this battle, Master of Saber."[lr]::
54256::$$$message_0474_0048_0010$$$::I cannot trust you with Sakura. I'd rather not do this, but you will die here."[lr]::
