13275::$$$message_0131_0000_0000$$$::"I-I should be the one asking you! What were you thinking!?[lr]::
13276::$$$message_0131_0000_0001$$$::I have repeatedly told you never to go out alone, but you allowed Illyasviel to capture you[line2]easily at that[line2]and bring you here!"::
13277::$$$message_0131_0001_0000$$$::"You have failed as a Master. I insist you make an apology for this!"::
13278::$$$message_0131_0002_0000$$$::"Ugh...I know I was careless. But seriously, why are you here!?[lr]::
13279::$$$message_0131_0002_0001$$$::You can barely move, so what were you thinking, coming to Illya's stronghold in this state!?"::
13280::$$$message_0131_0003_0000$$$::"I could ask the same of you![lr]::
13281::$$$message_0131_0003_0001$$$::Servants protect their Masters. It does not matter where you were taken, even Illyasviel's stronghold."::
13282::$$$message_0131_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
13283::$$$message_0131_0004_0001$$$::Saber is blunt as ever.[lr]::
13284::$$$message_0131_0004_0002$$$::She's exactly as she's always been.[lr]::
13285::$$$message_0131_0004_0003$$$::This isn't the weak, slumbering Saber from last night.::
13286::$$$message_0131_0005_0000$$$::"Shirou? Why have you clammed up? I-I knew it... You were injured in your captivity!"[lr]::
13287::$$$message_0131_0005_0001$$$::"Uh...no, that's not it. Don't worry about me. I'm just glad to see you doing better."::
13288::$$$message_0131_0006_0000$$$::I'm genuinely relieved.[lr]::
13289::$$$message_0131_0006_0001$$$::I'm surprised to see Saber here, but I'm much happier to see that she's herself.[lr]::
13290::$$$message_0131_0006_0002$$$::I know it's selfish of me to think this way...[lr]::
13291::$$$message_0131_0006_0003$$$::...but I think this is how Saber should be.::
13292::$$$message_0131_0007_0000$$$::"I'm sorry, Saber. I don't fully understand, but you came to rescue me, right?"::
13293::$$$message_0131_0008_0000$$$::"Oh...yes. It is a Servant's duty to rescue her Master."[lr]::
13294::$$$message_0131_0008_0001$$$::"Thanks. I'm really glad you came."::
13295::$$$message_0131_0009_0000$$$::   What a relief.[lr]::
13296::$$$message_0131_0009_0001$$$::Everything's sorted itself out.[lr]::
13297::$$$message_0131_0009_0002$$$::Now I just need to get out of here with Saber.[lr]::
13298::$$$message_0131_0009_0003$$$::...Wait a minute.[lr]::
13299::$$$message_0131_0009_0004$$$::Is that...Tohsaka?::
13300::$$$message_0131_0010_0000$$$::"T-Tohsaka!?"[lr]::
13301::$$$message_0131_0010_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Ummm...[font italic=false][lr]::
13302::$$$message_0131_0010_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Are you real? And are you really right here?[font italic=false]::
13303::$$$message_0131_0011_0000$$$::"You look better than I thought you would. Maybe I didn't need to come."::
13304::$$$message_0131_0012_0000$$$::"That's what I said, Rin. I told you to just leave Shirou Emiya be.[lr]::
13305::$$$message_0131_0012_0001$$$::All he does is cause trouble for everyone around him, then somehow survive himself. This would have been a perfect opportunity to just leave him to die on his own."::
13306::$$$message_0131_0013_0000$$$::"Please, Archer. Hold your tongue.[lr]::
13307::$$$message_0131_0013_0001$$$::I asked for your help, yes, but that does not give you the right to insult Shirou."::
13308::$$$message_0131_0014_0000$$$::"Hmph. You talk big now that your Master's safe. First the Master, then the Servant. They don't have an ounce of gratitude for their own allies.[lr]::
13309::$$$message_0131_0014_0001$$$::...Well, we're going to end up fighting eventually. It's probably best not to have too much in the way of fond feelings."::
13310::$$$message_0131_0015_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
13311::$$$message_0131_0015_0001$$$::He must have hit a nerve, as Saber grows silent.[lr]::
13312::$$$message_0131_0015_0002$$$::This guy...[lr]::
13313::$$$message_0131_0015_0003$$$::He's not just unfriendly to me. He treats Saber the same way.::
13314::$$$message_0131_0016_0000$$$::"Enough. I hope you haven't forgotten the situation we're all in right now, Archer.[lr]::
13315::$$$message_0131_0016_0001$$$::We don't have time for bickering. We need to get out of here before Illyasviel comes back."::
13316::$$$message_0131_0017_0000$$$::"Huh? Wait a minute.[lr]::
13317::$$$message_0131_0017_0001$$$::You came here knowing this is where Illya lives? And actually..."[lr]::
13318::$$$message_0131_0017_0002$$$::Illya left saying she was going to kill Tohsaka and Saber.[lr]::
13319::$$$message_0131_0017_0003$$$::That means Illya and Tohsaka passed each other.::
13320::$$$message_0131_0018_0000$$$::"That's a relief. I think Illya's heading to my place right now. If you guys hadn't come here, you would have had to fight her there."::
13321::$$$message_0131_0019_0000$$$::"Yeah, looks that way. I did see Illya and Berserker head outside. Though I must admit that if they hadn't left, we wouldn't have been able to sneak in here in the first place."::
13322::$$$message_0131_0020_0000$$$::...I get it. Saber and Tohsaka only managed to pull something so bold off because they saw Illya leave.[lr]::
13323::$$$message_0131_0020_0001$$$::She's bold as ever, but this time, that brazenness worked to our advantage. I'm impressed.::
13324::$$$message_0131_0021_0000$$$::"We'll talk later. I braced myself, knowing that this was the Einzbern's hideout, but it would be much better if we could avoid confronting any of them at all.[lr]::
13325::$$$message_0131_0021_0001$$$::And Saber's in no state to go up against Berserker right now."[lr]::
13326::$$$message_0131_0021_0002$$$::Tohsaka gestures for me and Saber to separate.::
13327::$$$message_0131_0022_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. What do you mean, Saber's in no state...?[lr]::
13328::$$$message_0131_0022_0001$$$::She's got her color back, and she's acting like herself."::
13329::$$$message_0131_0023_0000$$$::"You should really know better than to be so blindly optimistic.[lr]::
13330::$$$message_0131_0023_0001$$$::Saber hasn't recovered at all. Can't you see that she's barely able to stand?"[lr]::
13331::$$$message_0131_0023_0002$$$::"Rin! You promised to keep that to yourself!"::
13332::$$$message_0131_0024_0000$$$::"Sorry. I need to go back on my word. Keeping quiet won't help anyone, and this isn't a secret we can keep forever anyway."[lr]::
13333::$$$message_0131_0024_0001$$$::"...That may be true, but..."[lr]::
13334::$$$message_0131_0024_0002$$$::She sounds so pained...[lr]::
13335::$$$message_0131_0024_0003$$$::And now I see nothing has changed about her situation.::
13336::$$$message_0131_0025_0000$$$::"Saber. Is Tohsaka telling the truth...?"[lr]::
13337::$$$message_0131_0025_0001$$$::"...Yes. Rin is correct. It is embarrassing to admit, but I am in no position to fight as a Saber right now. At best, I can be your shield."::
13338::$$$message_0131_0026_0000$$$::"Hmph. I figured as much. She's too weak to even armor herself up, but she insisted she come with us.[lr]::
13339::$$$message_0131_0026_0001$$$::She probably figured she'd defend her Master even if she couldn't really fight."::
13340::$$$message_0131_0027_0000$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
13341::$$$message_0131_0027_0001$$$::She's so weak she can't even arm herself...[lr]::
13342::$$$message_0131_0027_0002$$$::She was willing to become my shield since she couldn't fight...? What kind of absurd nonsense is she saying?::
13343::$$$message_0131_0028_0000$$$::"I am sorry, Shirou. I know I am useless as a Servant in my current state, but I can at least be your shield. I know this is not ideal for you, but it is the only[line2]"::
13344::$$$message_0131_0029_0000$$$::   [font italic=true]Oh come on![font italic=false][lr]::
13345::$$$message_0131_0029_0001$$$::Why does Saber never think about herself? Why is she only ever worried about everyone else!?::
13346::$$$message_0131_0030_0000$$$::"To hell with that! Of course I'm not happy![lr]::
13347::$$$message_0131_0030_0001$$$::Tohsaka! Why did you bring Saber!?[lr]::
13348::$$$message_0131_0030_0002$$$::Don't you realize Saber needs more help than me right now!?"::
13349::$$$message_0131_0031_0000$$$::"Wh-what? I tried to stop her! Saber refused to listen, and...we wouldn't have been able to pinpoint where you were without her in the first place! I know it was risky, but we needed Saber!"::
13350::$$$message_0131_0032_0000$$$::"But you still..."[lr]::
13351::$$$message_0131_0032_0001$$$::I want to tell her she shouldn't have brought Saber, but I stop myself.[lr]::
13352::$$$message_0131_0032_0002$$$::I have no business criticizing.[lr]::
13353::$$$message_0131_0032_0003$$$::This is only happening because I went and got captured.[lr]::
13354::$$$message_0131_0032_0004$$$::Tohsaka and Saber were just doing what they thought was right.::
13355::$$$message_0131_0033_0000$$$::"Enough squabbling. Just leave it alone for now, Rin.[lr]::
13356::$$$message_0131_0033_0001$$$::Masters are sensitive to any changes in their homes, so we don't have time to explain every detail just now."::
13357::$$$message_0131_0034_0000$$$::"You're right. Illyasviel must be surprised we're gone, so she's probably coming back real quick.[lr]::
13358::$$$message_0131_0034_0001$$$::Fine. Let's talk later. Right now our priority is getting out of this castle. Are you okay with that, Shirou?"::
13359::$$$message_0131_0035_0000$$$::"Shirou, we should..."[lr]::
13360::$$$message_0131_0035_0001$$$::"Yeah, but..."[lr]::
13361::$$$message_0131_0035_0002$$$::If Saber is as bad as she was last night, it'll be hard for her to even walk right now.[lr]::
13362::$$$message_0131_0035_0003$$$::I don't want to push Saber any harder than I have already.::
13363::$$$message_0131_0036_0000$$$::"Honestly, you all underestimate me."[lr]::
13364::$$$message_0131_0036_0001$$$::"Eh, Saber?"::
13365::$$$message_0131_0037_0000$$$::"Even low on magical energy, I can still fight better than Shirou. If anything, I am more concerned about Shirou disappearing.[lr]::
13366::$$$message_0131_0037_0001$$$::...Rin may not have noticed, but your magical energy is disordered, is it not?"::
13367::$$$message_0131_0038_0000$$$::"Huh...? Well, this is nothing. I can manage.[lr]::
13368::$$$message_0131_0038_0001$$$::I'm...well, I'm totally fine. Really."::
13369::$$$message_0131_0039_0000$$$::"Then we are in the same state, you and I. I may be slightly uncomfortable, but it is not unbearable.[lr]::
13370::$$$message_0131_0039_0001$$$::This may all be difficult to accept given how quickly it has happened, but let us follow Rin for now. We can discuss this further once we have returned home."[lr]::
13371::$$$message_0131_0039_0002$$$::Saber encourages me to go.::
13372::$$$message_0131_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
13373::$$$message_0131_0040_0001$$$::I give up.[lr]::
13374::$$$message_0131_0040_0002$$$::She looks so serious, so determined that I can't worry anymore.::
13375::$$$message_0131_0041_0000$$$::"You're right. There are tons of things I want to talk about, but they can wait until we all get home safely."[lr]::
13376::$$$message_0131_0041_0001$$$::I want to ask about Saber's condition...and I want to thank her for coming to rescue me.[lr]::
13377::$$$message_0131_0041_0002$$$::   But now isn't the time to ask her about the dream I had.::
13378::$$$message_0131_0042_0000$$$::"Okay. Let's go, Saber."[lr]::
13379::$$$message_0131_0042_0001$$$::I nod, and get moving as best I can.::
13380::$$$message_0131_0043_0000$$$::Every step is a supreme effort, but this isn't the time for whining.[lr]::
13381::$$$message_0131_0043_0001$$$::Even weakened as she is, Saber came all the way here.::
13382::$$$message_0131_0044_0000$$$::"...Whoa."[lr]::
13383::$$$message_0131_0044_0001$$$::Is this a hallway?[lr]::
13384::$$$message_0131_0044_0002$$$::This corridor wouldn't be out of place in a museum... Illya's castle must be massive.::
13385::$$$message_0131_0045_0000$$$::"Hey, no time to gawk. Even if we make it out of the castle, the forest surrounding it is huge. If we don't hurry, it'll be morning before we're out."::
13386::$$$message_0131_0046_0000$$$::"A forest? So are we really in the mountains? Are you talking about the forest that's a couple hours from Miyama by car?"::
13387::$$$message_0131_0047_0000$$$::"Yep. We're in the Einzbern's secret castle.[lr]::
13388::$$$message_0131_0047_0001$$$::Once we make it out, it'll take a few hours to get through the forest. It's nighttime right now, so we should be out of the forest before the sun rises."::
13389::$$$message_0131_0048_0000$$$::Tohsaka heads through the hallway, not hesitating for a moment.[lr]::
13390::$$$message_0131_0048_0001$$$::She's probably heading toward whatever door they snuck in through.::
13391::$$$message_0131_0049_0000$$$::"...I figured it was night but...how long have I been here?"[lr]::
13392::$$$message_0131_0049_0001$$$::I thought it was about half a day, but maybe it's actually been a few days.::
13393::$$$message_0131_0050_0000$$$::"Illyasviel captured you in the morning, so it's been about half a day.[lr]::
13394::$$$message_0131_0050_0001$$$::Though, the date has changed, so you have spent a day in captivity, I suppose."::
13395::$$$message_0131_0051_0000$$$::"Ugh...I see. Sorry."[lr]::
13396::$$$message_0131_0051_0001$$$::"No, please do not apologize. Illyasviel held you captive for a considerable amount of time, but you are still safe. That must be proof that you did not submit mentally, even though your body was captive."::
13397::$$$message_0131_0052_0000$$$::"Well, that may be true, but..."[lr]::
13398::$$$message_0131_0052_0001$$$::"Yes. Illyasviel may look like a young girl, but she is still an Einzbern mage. Had you submitted to her, you would likely no longer be yourself."::
13399::$$$message_0131_0053_0000$$$::"And it is not as if I did not consider that possibility. I came to this castle fully prepared to find you dead."[lr]::
13400::$$$message_0131_0053_0001$$$::...::
13401::$$$message_0131_0054_0000$$$::"...Which is why I was so glad to reunite with you, Shirou.[lr]::
13402::$$$message_0131_0054_0001$$$::My Master has shown me that he is all right, so I cannot possibly show myself to be any worse off."::
13403::$$$message_0131_0055_0000$$$::I feel the same.[lr]::
13404::$$$message_0131_0055_0001$$$::I couldn't stand not knowing if Saber was safe or not.::
13405::$$$message_0131_0056_0000$$$::"Hey! You two [font italic=true]are[font italic=false] serious about escaping, right?[lr]::
13406::$$$message_0131_0056_0001$$$::If you guys fall behind, I'm gonna leave you!"[lr]::
13407::$$$message_0131_0056_0002$$$::Tohsaka pops her head from the bend of the corridor to yell at us.::
13408::$$$message_0131_0057_0000$$$::"Crap. This really isn't the time for us to chat. Let's hurry, Saber."[lr]::
13409::$$$message_0131_0057_0001$$$::I break into a run, urging Saber to do the same.[lr]::
13410::$$$message_0131_0057_0002$$$::...Ungh.[lr]::
13411::$$$message_0131_0057_0003$$$::Everything hurts, but I grit my teeth and keep going.::
13412::$$$message_0131_0058_0000$$$::I drive my aching body on, following Tohsaka.[lr]::
13413::$$$message_0131_0058_0001$$$::As I half-limp, half-run, Saber brings up the rear.[lr]::
13414::$$$message_0131_0058_0002$$$::...She must be in a lot of pain too.[lr]::
13415::$$$message_0131_0058_0003$$$::She's pretending not to be, but she's in no condition for this.::
13416::$$$message_0131_0059_0000$$$::"Saber, if it's hard for you..."[lr]::
13417::$$$message_0131_0059_0001$$$::I want to tell her I'll give her a helping hand, but I stop myself.[lr]::
13418::$$$message_0131_0059_0002$$$::Saying that will just make Saber dig in her heels and be more determined not to accept help.::
13419::$$$message_0131_0060_0000$$$::All I can do is keep an eye on her.[lr]::
13420::$$$message_0131_0060_0001$$$::Once Saber's too exhausted to complain, I'll just carry her.[lr]::
13421::$$$message_0131_0060_0002$$$::...Honestly, Saber can be incorrigible sometimes.[lr]::
13422::$$$message_0131_0060_0003$$$::She has to be [font italic=true]forced[font italic=false] to even take a break!::
13423::$$$message_0131_0061_0000$$$::And so...[lr]::
13424::$$$message_0131_0061_0001$$$::With Tohsaka leading the way, we managed to get to the exit.::
13425::$$$message_0131_0062_0000$$$::"Hey, you said this was an exit, but this is the entrance, Tohsaka!"[lr]::
13426::$$$message_0131_0062_0001$$$::"Huh? What are you on about? You do know that you can go in [font italic=true]and[font italic=false] out of entrances, right?"[lr]::
13427::$$$message_0131_0062_0002$$$::Tohsaka hurries down the stairs.::
13428::$$$message_0131_0063_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
13429::$$$message_0131_0063_0001$$$::Well, I'm in no position to complain.[lr]::
13430::$$$message_0131_0063_0002$$$::Saber and I head down the stairs and into the hall.[lr]::
13431::$$$message_0131_0063_0003$$$::It looks like a lobby.[lr]::
13432::$$$message_0131_0063_0004$$$::All we have to do now is head out through the big door at the other end of the hall and we're out.::
13433::$$$message_0131_0064_0000$$$::"Okay. We should be okay now that we've come this far. The problem now is how we get through the forest. We might be able to use the cover of darkness to reach the main road.[lr]::
13434::$$$message_0131_0064_0001$$$::We really don't want to be here when Illyasviel comes back and finds you're gone.[lr]::
13435::$$$message_0131_0064_0002$$$::By the time she comes back, it'll be morning... Hey, what's with that look, Shirou? You've obviously got a problem."::
13436::$$$message_0131_0065_0000$$$::"Uh, nothing. Just kind of...remembering how ballsy you are."::
13437::$$$message_0131_0066_0000$$$::"Huh? You have the weirdest thoughts at the weirdest times..."[lr]::
13438::$$$message_0131_0066_0001$$$::...Well, I was more getting at her just...walking into the enemy stronghold through the front door.::
13439::$$$message_0131_0067_0000$$$::"Well, whatever. Let's just head out. I remember the way back from here, so we won't get lost."::
13440::$$$message_0131_0068_0000$$$::We head towards the entrance.[lr]::
13441::$$$message_0131_0068_0001$$$::A long, narrow hall extends from the lobby, and at the end of it is an enormous door.[lr]::
13442::$$$message_0131_0068_0002$$$::The hall is, unbelievably, about thirty meters long.[lr]::
13443::$$$message_0131_0068_0003$$$::I'm reminded that we're standing in an actual castle, but in the next moment...::
13444::$$$message_0131_0069_0000$$$::"Oh. Going home already? What a shame, after you came all the way here."::
13445::$$$message_0131_0070_0000$$$::Illya shouldn't be here, but her giggling voice echoes up and down the hall.::
13446::$$$message_0131_0071_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
13447::$$$message_0131_0071_0001$$$::I whirl around.[lr]::
13448::$$$message_0131_0071_0002$$$::Everyone skids to a stop.[lr]::
13449::$$$message_0131_0071_0003$$$::The instant we see our enemy, we know we're dead as soon as we turn our backs to them.::
13450::$$$message_0131_0072_0000$$$::"Illya...sviel..."[lr]::
13451::$$$message_0131_0072_0001$$$::Tohsaka's voice trembles.[lr]::
13452::$$$message_0131_0072_0002$$$::Back at the other end of the hall...[lr]::
13453::$$$message_0131_0072_0003$$$::...we see her standing at the top of the stairs we just descended. She shouldn't be here...::
13454::$$$message_0131_0073_0000$$$::   Ironically, it's a similar arrangement to our first meeting.[lr]::
13455::$$$message_0131_0073_0001$$$::Illya standing above us with Berserker behind her.[lr]::
13456::$$$message_0131_0073_0002$$$::Berserker's presence is overwhelming.[lr]::
13457::$$$message_0131_0073_0003$$$::Now that I can assess a Servant's strength, I understand what a monster he really is.[lr]::
13458::$$$message_0131_0073_0004$$$::We can't do this.[lr]::
13459::$$$message_0131_0073_0005$$$::Even if Saber was at full strength, Berserker is just too powerful.::
13460::$$$message_0131_0074_0000$$$::...It wouldn't even be a battle.[lr]::
13461::$$$message_0131_0074_0001$$$::That monster can't be beat. Not in a fight.[lr]::
13462::$$$message_0131_0074_0002$$$::If we are ever going to beat Berserker, we have to figure out how to do it without fighting him.[lr]::
13463::$$$message_0131_0074_0003$$$::In other words...[lr]::
13464::$$$message_0131_0074_0004$$$::If we want to live, we need to stay far away from Berserker.::
13465::$$$message_0131_0075_0000$$$::"Good evening. I'm so happy you came to see me, Rin."[lr]::
13466::$$$message_0131_0075_0001$$$::Illya's voice is cheerful and bouncy.[lr]::
13467::$$$message_0131_0075_0002$$$::She's smiling that same smile I saw the night we met. Innocent but merciless... She won't settle to squash us like bugs.::
13468::$$$message_0131_0076_0000$$$::  And that's when I realized.[lr]::
13469::$$$message_0131_0076_0001$$$::We're not going to escape. Period.[lr]::
13470::$$$message_0131_0076_0002$$$::No matter what I do, I can't stop Illya.[lr]::
13471::$$$message_0131_0076_0003$$$::Even if I try to draw Illya's attention, that won't let Tohsaka and the others escape.::
13472::$$$message_0131_0077_0000$$$::"What's wrong? You're so boring when you just keep your mouth shut. I'm giving you some time, so I suggest writing a will while you still can."::
13473::$$$message_0131_0078_0000$$$::She giggles.[lr]::
13474::$$$message_0131_0078_0001$$$::But we don't have time for these kinds of games.[lr]::
13475::$$$message_0131_0078_0002$$$::We need to run to the entrance the second we can find an opening.[lr]::
13476::$$$message_0131_0078_0003$$$::Even if we know we'll never get an opening, all we can do is wait and hope.::
13477::$$$message_0131_0079_0000$$$::"...Then let me ask you one thing."[lr]::
13478::$$$message_0131_0079_0001$$$::Even in this situation...[lr]::
13479::$$$message_0131_0079_0002$$$::Tohsaka takes a step closer towards Illya.::
13480::$$$message_0131_0080_0000$$$::"Illyasviel. I didn't sense your presence coming back. Were you hiding this entire time?"::
13481::$$$message_0131_0081_0000$$$::"Yes. I didn't go anywhere. I was watching all of you make fools out of yourselves from here."[lr]::
13482::$$$message_0131_0081_0001$$$::"Oh really. So that wasn't the real you heading outside?"::
13483::$$$message_0131_0082_0000$$$::"Right. I knew you were coming.[lr]::
13484::$$$message_0131_0082_0001$$$::I'm the lord of this place, so I should entertain my guests, right?"::
13485::$$$message_0131_0083_0000$$$::Right then, the giant vanishes.[lr]::
13486::$$$message_0131_0083_0001$$$::I'm not sure if it jumped or just moved.[lr]::
13487::$$$message_0131_0083_0002$$$::The next thing I know, Berserker appears in the middle of the lobby, creating a whirlwind.::
13488::$$$message_0131_0084_0000$$$::This is the end for us.[lr]::
13489::$$$message_0131_0084_0001$$$::If we retreat towards the entrance, he'll slice us in half with that axe-sword the moment we turn our backs to him.[lr]::
13490::$$$message_0131_0084_0002$$$::But we're dead if we stay here too.[lr]::
13491::$$$message_0131_0084_0003$$$::Our only other option is to challenge that walking mass of death, however futile it'll be.::
13492::$$$message_0131_0085_0000$$$::"Are we done talking? Then let's begin, Berserker."[lr]::
13493::$$$message_0131_0085_0001$$$::The pale girl raises her hand as if performing a ritual, and looks down on us[lr]::
13494::$$$message_0131_0085_0002$$$::"I swear I won't let anyone get away today."[lr]::
13495::$$$message_0131_0085_0003$$$::Her declaration is equal parts murderous intent and delight.::
13496::$$$message_0131_0086_0000$$$::Berserker's eyes light up.[lr]::
13497::$$$message_0131_0086_0001$$$::Before, Berserker had moved only as Illya ordered, but now he's free to act, and he identifies us as enemies.::
13498::$$$message_0131_0087_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
13499::$$$message_0131_0087_0001$$$::Something's making a grinding sound.[lr]::
13500::$$$message_0131_0087_0002$$$::"Tohsaka...?"[lr]::
13501::$$$message_0131_0087_0003$$$::Tohsaka grits her teeth hard, as if in regret.::
13502::$$$message_0131_0088_0000$$$::"...Archer, can you hear me?"[lr]::
13503::$$$message_0131_0088_0001$$$::Tohsaka speaks quietly, without turning.[lr]::
13504::$$$message_0131_0088_0002$$$::"We don't need long. Distract him for us."[lr]::
13505::$$$message_0131_0088_0003$$$::She just ordered her Servant to his death.::
13506::$$$message_0131_0089_0000$$$::...[lr]::
13507::$$$message_0131_0089_0001$$$::Archer doesn't answer.[lr]::
13508::$$$message_0131_0089_0002$$$::"Ridiculous! Are you mad, Rin? Archer cannot possibly go up against Berserker alone!"[lr]::
13509::$$$message_0131_0089_0003$$$::"We're going to take that chance to escape. Archer is going to buy us time."::
13510::$$$message_0131_0090_0000$$$::Tohsaka continues giving her orders, ignoring Saber.[lr]::
13511::$$$message_0131_0090_0001$$$::Her voice is cold, devoid of any emotion.::
13512::$$$message_0131_0091_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
13513::$$$message_0131_0091_0001$$$::Archer, who had been silent as if pondering something, his eyes fixed on Berserker, gives a slight nod.[lr]::
13514::$$$message_0131_0091_0002$$$::"A sound plan. I will be able to escape once Rin and the others have.[lr]::
13515::$$$message_0131_0091_0003$$$::Independent Action is an Archer's strong suit."[lr]::
13516::$$$message_0131_0091_0004$$$::He takes a step forward as if to protect Tohsaka.::
13517::$$$message_0131_0092_0000$$$::Berserker doesn't move.[lr]::
13518::$$$message_0131_0092_0001$$$::Illya's laughter echoes from above.::
13519::$$$message_0131_0093_0000$$$::"Oh wow, this is a surprise. You think your nobody of a Servant can stop my Heracles.[lr]::
13520::$$$message_0131_0093_0001$$$::I never thought you would do something so cute, Rin."::
13521::$$$message_0131_0094_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
13522::$$$message_0131_0094_0001$$$::Neither Tohsaka nor Archer are in any position to object.[lr]::
13523::$$$message_0131_0094_0002$$$::They know better than anyone.::
13524::$$$message_0131_0095_0000$$$::Archer steps forward.[lr]::
13525::$$$message_0131_0095_0001$$$::He's empty-handed as usual.::
13526::$$$message_0131_0096_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
13527::$$$message_0131_0096_0001$$$::Tohsaka looks at Archer's back.[lr]::
13528::$$$message_0131_0096_0002$$$::There's nothing she can say to him.[lr]::
13529::$$$message_0131_0096_0003$$$::She must know her orders are absurd.[lr]::
13530::$$$message_0131_0096_0004$$$::They amounted to telling Archer to die so we could escape.::
13531::$$$message_0131_0097_0000$$$::"...Archer, I[line2]"[lr]::
13532::$$$message_0131_0097_0001$$$::Tohsaka is about to say something.[lr]::
13533::$$$message_0131_0097_0002$$$::But...[lr]::
13534::$$$message_0131_0097_0003$$$::"Rin, I just want to check something with you."[lr]::
13535::$$$message_0131_0097_0004$$$::Archer interrupts her, speaking so nonchalantly that it seems out of place. ::
13536::$$$message_0131_0098_0000$$$::"...Fine. What?"[lr]::
13537::$$$message_0131_0098_0001$$$::Tohsaka turns toward Archer, her eyes downcast.[lr]::
13538::$$$message_0131_0098_0002$$$::Archer's gaze stays locked on Berserker.::
13539::$$$message_0131_0099_0000$$$::"Yeah. I don't mind buying you time...[r][wsay canskip=1]::
13540::$$$message_0131_0099_0001$$$::But you wouldn't mind if I just beat this thing, right?"[lr]::
13541::$$$message_0131_0099_0002$$$::It sounds completely ridiculous.::
13542::$$$message_0131_0100_0000$$$::"Archer, are you..."::
13543::$$$message_0131_0101_0000$$$::"...No, there's no need to hold back.[lr]::
13544::$$$message_0131_0101_0001$$$::Give him hell, Archer."::
13545::$$$message_0131_0102_0000$$$::"Understood. Guess I should try to live up to your expectations."[lr]::
13546::$$$message_0131_0102_0001$$$::Archer walks forward.[lr]::
13547::$$$message_0131_0102_0002$$$::Only ten meters until he reaches Berserker.[lr]::
13548::$$$message_0131_0102_0003$$$::At this distance, it could close on Archer instantly.::
13549::$$$message_0131_0103_0000$$$::"You're making a mockery of me! Fine! Get him, Berserker! Go, tear that cocky man to pieces!"[lr]::
13550::$$$message_0131_0103_0001$$$::Illya's voice is hysterical.[lr]::
13551::$$$message_0131_0103_0002$$$::Tohsaka turns her back, not paying attention.::
13552::$$$message_0131_0104_0000$$$::"Let's go. Once we're out, we've won."[lr]::
13553::$$$message_0131_0104_0001$$$::Tohsaka grabs my hand, as well as Saber's, and runs.::
13554::$$$message_0131_0105_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
13555::$$$message_0131_0105_0001$$$::Saber doesn't object; she follows Tohsaka.[lr]::
13556::$$$message_0131_0105_0002$$$::I start running toward the entrance, leaving Archer behind.[lr]::
13557::$$$message_0131_0105_0003$$$::But then, from behind me...[lr]::
13558::$$$message_0131_0105_0004$$$::"Shirou Emiya."[lr]::
13559::$$$message_0131_0105_0005$$$::He calls out to me, his back still to me.::
13560::$$$message_0131_0106_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
13561::$$$message_0131_0106_0001$$$::I let go of Tohsaka's hand and turned around.[lr]::
13562::$$$message_0131_0106_0002$$$::In the lobby, now a good ways from me, I see Archer's back as he faces down Berserker.::
13563::$$$message_0131_0107_0000$$$::"Listen. You're not a fighter. You only create."[lr]::
13564::$$$message_0131_0107_0001$$$::Berserker draws near.[lr]::
13565::$$$message_0131_0107_0002$$$::Archer is still empty-handed, and he doesn't take a single step while he watches his enemy closing in.::
13566::$$$message_0131_0108_0000$$$::"Don't think about anything else. There's only one thing you can do, so master that one thing."[lr]::
13567::$$$message_0131_0108_0001$$$::Archer raises one hand.[lr]::
13568::$$$message_0131_0108_0002$$$::I have no idea when he got it, but he's holding a short sword now.::
13569::$$$message_0131_0109_0000$$$::"Don't forget. What you need to do is to always imagine yourself as the strongest. You don't need an enemy. The only opponent you need to fight is your own mind."[lr]::
13570::$$$message_0131_0109_0001$$$::I see him start to shift.[lr]::
13571::$$$message_0131_0109_0002$$$::Berserker's sword sends a rush of wind ahead of him.::
13572::$$$message_0131_0110_0000$$$::I turn and run, not staying to watch the clash.[lr]::
13573::$$$message_0131_0110_0001$$$::Tohsaka and Saber are already at the entrance.[lr]::
13574::$$$message_0131_0110_0002$$$::   I run and I don't look back.[lr]::
13575::$$$message_0131_0110_0003$$$::The sight of the man in red made it clear that I needed to go.::é6
