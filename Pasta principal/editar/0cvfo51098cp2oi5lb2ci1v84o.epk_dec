32374::$$$message_0262_0000_0000$$$::"No, come back Saber...!"[lr]::
32375::$$$message_0262_0000_0001$$$::I hear my voice, shouting at Saber before I even realize what I'm doing.::
32376::$$$message_0262_0001_0000$$$::"Master...?"[lr]::
32377::$$$message_0262_0001_0001$$$::Saber's steps slow, as if she heard my command.[lr]::
32378::$$$message_0262_0001_0002$$$::But it's not enough! She won't get away in time...!::
32379::$$$message_0262_0002_0000$$$::"It's dangerous, please get away...!"[lr]::
32380::$$$message_0262_0002_0001$$$::"No! [font italic=true]You're[font italic=false] in danger! Just, come here...!"[lr]::
32381::$$$message_0262_0002_0002$$$::I reach my hand out to Saber.::
32382::$$$message_0262_0003_0000$$$::"I am...? Nn...!?"[lr]::
32383::$$$message_0262_0003_0001$$$::She must have understood. Saber turns from Berserker and dashes away from the battlefield as fast as she can.::
32384::$$$message_0262_0004_0000$$$::Just as Saber retreats...[lr]::
32385::$$$message_0262_0004_0001$$$::...Archer fires his "arrow."::
32386::$$$message_0262_0005_0000$$$::Saber jumps clear like sparks from a flame and Berserker rushes after her.[lr]::
32387::$$$message_0262_0005_0001$$$::Archer's attack impacts between the two of them, at the center of the battlefield.[lr]::
32388::$$$message_0262_0005_0002$$$::Up until now, his shots have done nothing.[lr]::
32389::$$$message_0262_0005_0003$$$::Saber approaches, as if those arrows aren't even worth dodging.::
32390::$$$message_0262_0006_0000$$$::But, just then...::
32391::$$$message_0262_0007_0000$$$::"[wacky len=15]"[lr]::
32392::$$$message_0262_0007_0001$$$::The giant turns his back to us, attacking the incoming projectiles with furious intensity.::
32393::$$$message_0262_0008_0000$$$::                                            In that instant...[lr]::
32394::$$$message_0262_0008_0001$$$::                                            ...sound fades entirely.::
32395::$$$message_0262_0009_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
32396::$$$message_0262_0009_0001$$$::I throw myself onto Saber and brace.[lr]::
32397::$$$message_0262_0009_0002$$$::I must've gone deaf; I can't hear a thing.[lr]::
32398::$$$message_0262_0009_0003$$$::But I can [font italic=true]feel[font italic=false] the vibrations in the air shaking my body and heat searing my skin.[lr]::
32399::$$$message_0262_0009_0004$$$::The blast kicks up all kinds of debris, and I feel something stab into my back.::
32400::$$$message_0262_0010_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
32401::$$$message_0262_0010_0001$$$::I grit my teeth and brace myself.[lr]::
32402::$$$message_0262_0010_0002$$$::The white flash of light must have lasted only an instant.[lr]::
32403::$$$message_0262_0010_0003$$$::Somehow, I survived.::
32404::$$$message_0262_0011_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
32405::$$$message_0262_0011_0001$$$::Saber is clearly stunned by what she's seen.[lr]::
32406::$$$message_0262_0011_0002$$$::...So am I.[lr]::
32407::$$$message_0262_0011_0003$$$::I have no idea what happened.[lr]::
32408::$$$message_0262_0011_0004$$$::I just know that Archer's attack wreathed the entire cemetery in flames.::
32409::$$$message_0262_0011_0005$$$::At the explosion's center is a smoking crater.[lr]::
32410::$$$message_0262_0011_0006$$$::That is the extent of his attack's destructive force.[lr]::
32411::$$$message_0262_0011_0007$$$::In the heart of all that incredible destruction stands the giant. Still alive.::
32412::$$$message_0262_0012_0000$$$::"...Berserker... He's unscathed even after taking a direct hit from a Rank A Noble Phantasm..."[lr]::
32413::$$$message_0262_0012_0001$$$::The strength seems to have gone from Saber's voice.[lr]::
32414::$$$message_0262_0012_0002$$$::Sparks flutter in the dark night air.[lr]::
32415::$$$message_0262_0012_0003$$$::The giant stands, motionless, in the flames while all present look on in stunned silence.::
32416::$$$message_0262_0013_0000$$$::The only sound to be heard is the soft crackling of the flames.[lr]::
32417::$$$message_0262_0013_0001$$$::Just when I thought the flames might grow out of control...[lr]::
32418::$$$message_0262_0013_0002$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
32419::$$$message_0262_0013_0003$$$::A strange metal...something rolls toward me, clanging across the rubble-strewn ground.::
32420::$$$message_0262_0014_0000$$$::"...A sword...?"[lr]::
32421::$$$message_0262_0014_0001$$$::No, it's an arrow.[lr]::
32422::$$$message_0262_0014_0002$$$::An arrow with a luxurious hilt and spiral blade.[lr]::
32423::$$$message_0262_0014_0003$$$::It [font italic=true]was[font italic=false] a sword, I think. But it was [font italic=true]used[font italic=false] as an arrow.::
32424::$$$message_0262_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32425::$$$message_0262_0015_0001$$$::I'm not sure why it captures my attention so much.[lr]::
32426::$$$message_0262_0015_0002$$$::The arrows Berserker smashes aside disappear, as if simply melting away.[lr]::
32427::$$$message_0262_0015_0003$$$::They fade without leaving a trace, like candle wax melting in flames.::
32428::$$$message_0262_0016_0000$$$::That...[lr]::
32429::$$$message_0262_0016_0001$$$::...makes me nauseous for no reason.::
32430::$$$message_0262_0017_0000$$$::"...Shirou, those were..."[lr]::
32431::$$$message_0262_0017_0001$$$::"...Archer's arrows. That's all I know."[lr]::
32432::$$$message_0262_0017_0002$$$::I look up and see Archer in the distance.::
32433::$$$message_0262_0018_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
32434::$$$message_0262_0018_0001$$$::I can't possibly see that far.[lr]::
32435::$$$message_0262_0018_0002$$$::I can't see it, but somehow...I do.[lr]::
32436::$$$message_0262_0018_0003$$$::He's smiling.[lr]::
32437::$$$message_0262_0018_0004$$$::He's smiling as if to say he hadn't just been aiming at Berserker.::
32438::$$$message_0262_0019_0000$$$::"That bastard...!"[lr]::
32439::$$$message_0262_0019_0001$$$::...I have a headache.[lr]::
32440::$$$message_0262_0019_0002$$$::The chills running down my spine don't stop.[lr]::
32441::$$$message_0262_0019_0003$$$::My spine is burning and I feel like throwing up, almost like the time I failed to create a Magic Circuit...::
32442::$$$message_0262_0020_0000$$$::"...Hm, I've underestimated you, Rin. Your Archer's not bad."[lr]::
32443::$$$message_0262_0020_0001$$$::The girl's cheerful voice drifts across the battlefield to us, but I'm not sure where from.::
32444::$$$message_0262_0021_0000$$$::"Okay, come back, Berserker. I wanted to get the boring stuff over with first, but my plans have changed."[lr]::
32445::$$$message_0262_0021_0001$$$::The dark shadow wavers.[lr]::
32446::$$$message_0262_0021_0002$$$::The giant obeys the girl's voice and retreats through the flames.::
32447::$$$message_0262_0022_0000$$$::"Oh, come on. You're going to run away after all this?"[lr]::
32448::$$$message_0262_0022_0001$$$::"Yes, I've changed my mind. I don't need Saber, but I'm interested in your Archer. So, I'll let you live a bit longer."::
32449::$$$message_0262_0023_0000$$$::The giant disappears.[lr]::
32450::$$$message_0262_0023_0001$$$::The girl in white giggles.[lr]::
32451::$$$message_0262_0023_0002$$$::"Bye-bye, then. Let's play again, big brother."[lr]::
32452::$$$message_0262_0023_0003$$$::With those as her parting words, she disappears on the other side of the flames.::
32453::$$$message_0262_0024_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
32454::$$$message_0262_0024_0001$$$::And just like that, she's gone.[lr]::
32455::$$$message_0262_0024_0002$$$::I'm sure Tohsaka doesn't actually plan to go after her, despite what she's said.[lr]::
32456::$$$message_0262_0024_0003$$$::Even I can tell that girl just let us go.[lr]::
32457::$$$message_0262_0024_0004$$$::I can't imagine Tohsaka seeking out a fight like that. It'd be too reckless.::
32458::$$$message_0262_0025_0000$$$::"Thank you, Master. Archer's Noble Phantasm would have hit me, had you not called out to me."[lr]::
32459::$$$message_0262_0025_0001$$$::"O-oh, I'm..."[lr]::
32460::$$$message_0262_0025_0002$$$::I try to say I was glad to help.::
32461::$$$message_0262_0026_0000$$$::"Master...?"[lr]::
32462::$$$message_0262_0026_0001$$$::...What's wrong with me?[lr]::
32463::$$$message_0262_0026_0002$$$::I'm not badly hurt, but I don't feel well, and I think I'm starting to...::
32464::$$$message_0262_0027_0000$$$::"...Emiya? You look really pale."[lr]::
32465::$$$message_0262_0027_0001$$$::"Master...? Shirou...!"[lr]::
32466::$$$message_0262_0027_0002$$$::...I fall to my knees.[lr]::
32467::$$$message_0262_0027_0003$$$::Suddenly, my vision goes white.::
32468::$$$message_0262_0028_0000$$$::"Pull yourself together...! What is going on...!?"[lr]::
32469::$$$message_0262_0028_0001$$$::...I feel someone catch me as I fall.[lr]::
32470::$$$message_0262_0028_0002$$$::But that feeling fades abruptly as most of my senses simply cut out.::
32471::$$$message_0262_0029_0000$$$::...All that's left is this throbbing.[lr]::
32472::$$$message_0262_0029_0001$$$::What's happening?[lr]::
32473::$$$message_0262_0029_0002$$$::What's wrong with me?[lr]::
32474::$$$message_0262_0029_0003$$$::...I'm slipping into unconsciousness, but my head continues to throb as if I have a fever.::
