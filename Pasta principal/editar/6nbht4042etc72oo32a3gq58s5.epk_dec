77092::$$$message_0717_0000_0000$$$::Osu! Let's start the Tiger Dojo, where we save dead men who beat a tactical retreat but still can't get away in time!::
77093::$$$message_0717_0000_0001$$$::Yup yup, here we go! Ugh, this sucks.::
77094::$$$message_0717_0000_0002$$$::Barrel a'dollars!::
77095::$$$message_0717_0000_0003$$$::What are you sulking for, Disciple Number One!? I forbade you from bringing your main story sentiments into this dojo!::
77096::$$$message_0717_0000_0004$$$::Yes, ma'am~[lr]::
77097::$$$message_0717_0000_0005$$$::But I can't really back him up this time, y'know?::
77098::$$$message_0717_0000_0006$$$::Mrgh. You've never sulked this hard before. Are you that against him picking Tohsaka over you?::
77099::$$$message_0717_0000_0007$$$::...No, I just feel sorry for Archer.::
77100::$$$message_0717_0000_0008$$$::Hm, hm. That's some behind-the-scenes talk that I don't know.::
77101::$$$message_0717_0000_0009$$$::But hey, that wasn't so bad. Miss Tohsaka and Archer and Shirou and you all died happily ever after!::
77102::$$$message_0717_0001_0000$$$::This ain't no joke, ya dumb tiger!::
77103::$$$message_0717_0001_0001$$$::Ugh, that's all for today!::
77104::$$$message_0717_0001_0002$$$::Shirou, go back to the last decision and do what Archer says![lr]::
77105::$$$message_0717_0001_0003$$$::No turning off the game today until you get out of the forest, okay!?::{Ô
