14706::$$$message_0138_0000_0000$$$::It's clear who the enemy is.[lr]::
14707::$$$message_0138_0000_0001$$$::If Caster is attacking with an entire army, there's only one thing for us to do.::
14708::$$$message_0138_0001_0000$$$::"Us staying here won't do anything. Saber, come with me. Tohsaka, you take Illya."[lr]::
14709::$$$message_0138_0001_0001$$$::"What!? Why!? I don't want to babysit Rin!"::
14710::$$$message_0138_0002_0000$$$::"That's my line! And I thought you said you were going to listen to Shirou. He's telling you to stay back, so no arguing."::
14711::$$$message_0138_0003_0000$$$::"I don't care![lr]::
14712::$$$message_0138_0003_0001$$$::I'm more useful than Saber[line2]"[lr]::
14713::$$$message_0138_0003_0002$$$::Tohsaka grabs Illya from behind in a full nelson and covers her mouth. ::
14714::$$$message_0138_0004_0000$$$::"Mmmnnngh! Mnnngh!!! Nnnngh!!!"[lr]::
14715::$$$message_0138_0004_0001$$$::Illya, her voice muffled, continues shouting insults and expletives.::
14716::$$$message_0138_0005_0000$$$::"Got it. I'll protect Illya. I'm counting on you to defeat Caster."::
14717::$$$message_0138_0006_0000$$$::"Thanks. But try not to overdo it. You're better off running than fighting, if it comes to it."[lr]::
14718::$$$message_0138_0006_0001$$$::Tohsaka nods, as if to say she doesn't have to be reminded.[lr]::
14719::$$$message_0138_0006_0002$$$::I turn my back to Tohsaka and head toward the veranda.::
14720::$$$message_0138_0007_0000$$$::"Saber."[lr]::
14721::$$$message_0138_0007_0001$$$::"Yes, I know. I will take care of Shirou."[lr]::
14722::$$$message_0138_0007_0002$$$::Saber follows me after nodding to Tohsaka.::
14723::$$$message_0138_0008_0000$$$::In that instant.[lr]::
14724::$$$message_0138_0008_0001$$$::I doubt my own eyes.::
14725::$$$message_0138_0009_0000$$$::A sword swings down at me.[lr]::
14726::$$$message_0138_0009_0001$$$::I stand, stunned, as the blade descends toward my head.::
14727::$$$message_0138_0010_0000$$$::"...Acgk!"[lr]::
14728::$$$message_0138_0010_0001$$$::I twist away and parry with my wooden sword.[lr]::
14729::$$$message_0138_0010_0002$$$::Even I don't believe it. [lr]::
14730::$$$message_0138_0010_0003$$$::My body just reacted the instant I knew I was in mortal peril.::
14731::$$$message_0138_0011_0000$$$::The enemy attacks again without missing a beat.[lr]::
14732::$$$message_0138_0011_0001$$$::A smooth, mechanical movement.[lr]::
14733::$$$message_0138_0011_0002$$$::A fluid, accurate attack.[lr]::
14734::$$$message_0138_0011_0003$$$::   But that's it.[lr]::
14735::$$$message_0138_0011_0004$$$::It's accurate, but it's not sophisticated, and it lacks the brutality of a killing strike.[lr]::
14736::$$$message_0138_0011_0005$$$::It seems pathetic next to the strength of Saber's strikes, like it's barely moving in comparison to Berserker's incredible speed.::
14737::$$$message_0138_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14738::$$$message_0138_0012_0001$$$::Back against the wall, I parry again.[lr]::
14739::$$$message_0138_0012_0002$$$::As I step back against the wall...[lr]::
14740::$$$message_0138_0012_0003$$$::Saber strikes like lightning.::
14741::$$$message_0138_0013_0000$$$::"Shirou, are you all right?"[lr]::
14742::$$$message_0138_0013_0001$$$::"See for yourself. I got a little spooked, but I managed."::
14743::$$$message_0138_0014_0000$$$::""That will not do. At times like this, you must stand behind me. Please be more careful."[lr]::
14744::$$$message_0138_0014_0001$$$::Saber scolds me for my carelessness.[lr]::
14745::$$$message_0138_0014_0002$$$::She's right, but I didn't want to just stay behind her.::
14746::$$$message_0138_0015_0000$$$::"Shirou? Are you listening?"[lr]::
14747::$$$message_0138_0015_0001$$$::"I am. So, Saber...what was that thing?"::
14748::$$$message_0138_0016_0000$$$::The hallway is empty.[lr]::
14749::$$$message_0138_0016_0001$$$::Whatever hideous thing Saber saved me from was completely annihilated by her attack.::
14750::$$$message_0138_0017_0000$$$::"It was exactly as Illyasviel said... It was a soldier made by using a monster's body as a catalyst. It seems more like a golem than an automaton, but seemed to be of low quality. I will have no trouble defeating them, even if we are surrounded."::
14751::$$$message_0138_0018_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
14752::$$$message_0138_0018_0001$$$::I don't know where they were hiding... How the hell many did they manage to sneak in?[lr]::
14753::$$$message_0138_0018_0002$$$::These crudely assembled...things scuttle all around us, closing in like spiders.[lr]::
14754::$$$message_0138_0018_0003$$$::But they're not the only presence I sense.[lr]::
14755::$$$message_0138_0018_0004$$$::Countless others surround the house, many times more than I see here.::
14756::$$$message_0138_0019_0000$$$::"Shirou, next to you!"[lr]::
14757::$$$message_0138_0019_0001$$$::"Hngh!"[lr]::
14758::$$$message_0138_0019_0002$$$::I leap away from the wall.[lr]::
14759::$$$message_0138_0019_0003$$$::"Kngh... Why you!"[lr]::
14760::$$$message_0138_0019_0004$$$::I strike at the bones with my wooden sword.[lr]::
14761::$$$message_0138_0019_0005$$$::Saber sweeps away the bones crawling toward my exposed back.::
14762::$$$message_0138_0020_0000$$$::The bones move jerkily toward us, attacking with the same unnatural movements.[lr]::
14763::$$$message_0138_0020_0001$$$::It's not hard to fight them off, but we're destroying more of the house with every strike.[lr]::
14764::$$$message_0138_0020_0002$$$::And I only have a wooden sword.[lr]::
14765::$$$message_0138_0020_0003$$$::Even if I use Strengthening on it, it won't last.::
14766::$$$message_0138_0021_0000$$$::As much as I hope I'm wrong, it seems like the bones heading for us are endless.[lr]::
14767::$$$message_0138_0021_0001$$$::I really hope this isn't going to go on until we both collapse from exhaustion.::
14768::$$$message_0138_0022_0000$$$::"Damn. Where are these things coming from!?"[lr]::
14769::$$$message_0138_0022_0001$$$::I can't help but complain as I fight back-to-back with Saber.[lr]::
14770::$$$message_0138_0022_0002$$$::There aren't that many bones coming at me.[lr]::
14771::$$$message_0138_0022_0003$$$::Some seem to be coming from inside the house, but most seem to be coming from the yard.[lr]::
14772::$$$message_0138_0022_0004$$$::Saber is slashing away at the bones coming from the yard.::
14773::$$$message_0138_0023_0000$$$::It looks like they're heading towards the living room.[lr]::
14774::$$$message_0138_0023_0001$$$::Tohsaka and Illya are in there, and Saber has her hands full dealing with the bones heading that way.::
14775::$$$message_0138_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14776::$$$message_0138_0024_0001$$$::Saber readies her sword.[lr]::
14777::$$$message_0138_0024_0002$$$::There may be no need to hide it now. Her golden sword is ready to demonstrate its true power.::
14778::$$$message_0138_0025_0000$$$::"W-wait Saber! Don't use Excalibur right now! I don't care if you destroy the house[line2]okay I might care a little, but we're in a residential area. You know what'll happen if you use it here!"[lr]::
14779::$$$message_0138_0025_0001$$$::I shout to Saber as I bat away the bones striking at me.::
14780::$$$message_0138_0026_0000$$$::"I will obey your order, but dealing with so many enemies at once is not ideal. We could find ourselves in trouble if we do not sweep them all aside in a single blow."[lr]::
14781::$$$message_0138_0026_0001$$$::"I know. These things are like familiars, right? Then if we defeat the one who's controlling them, that should wipe out the whole army. Saber, can you find Caster?"::
14782::$$$message_0138_0027_0000$$$::"There's no need. Caster is in the yard.[lr]::
14783::$$$message_0138_0027_0001$$$::She is not concealing herself, which tells me she hopes to lure us to her."::
14784::$$$message_0138_0028_0000$$$::"Fine. Let's give her what she wants. We aren't going to last like this."[lr]::
14785::$$$message_0138_0028_0001$$$::"I do not mind, but are you saying we are going to attack Caster there?"::
14786::$$$message_0138_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
14787::$$$message_0138_0029_0001$$$::The yard is just ahead.[lr]::
14788::$$$message_0138_0029_0002$$$::If Caster's just out there, she shouldn't be too difficult to reach.::
14789::$$$message_0138_0030_0000$$$::But if we do that, we won't be defending the house.[lr]::
14790::$$$message_0138_0030_0001$$$::Saber's fighting the bones off now, but as soon as she's outside, the wall holding them all back will be gone.[lr]::
14791::$$$message_0138_0030_0002$$$::I should...[lr]::qX
