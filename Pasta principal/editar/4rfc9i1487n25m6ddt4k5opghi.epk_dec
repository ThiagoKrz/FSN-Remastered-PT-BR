66698::$$$message_0617_0001_0001$$$::Something scary that kills people with each step it takes.[lr]::
66699::$$$message_0617_0001_0002$$$::...I watch it go from a place slightly behind it.[lr]::
66700::$$$message_0617_0001_0003$$$::I don't want to watch, but I can't turn away.::
66701::$$$message_0617_0002_0000$$$::It's a scary dream.[lr]::
66702::$$$message_0617_0002_0001$$$::A nightmare that I'll have to keep watching over and over.::
66703::$$$message_0617_0003_0000$$$::But if I'm being honest, I've started to feel a slight closeness to it.[lr]::
66704::$$$message_0617_0003_0001$$$::I was afraid at first, but I'm used to seeing it now.[lr]::
66705::$$$message_0617_0003_0002$$$::Above all, this child doesn't have a bad heart.[lr]::
66706::$$$message_0617_0003_0003$$$::It just eats in a different way than we do. It's a lot like me.::

66711::$$$message_0617_0005_0001$$$::Why do they all come up to it?[lr]::
66712::$$$message_0617_0005_0002$$$::Maybe it has something that draws men in.[lr]::
66713::$$$message_0617_0005_0003$$$::No matter how many people it kills,[lr]::
66714::$$$message_0617_0005_0004$$$::no matter how many days this goes on,[lr]::
66715::$$$message_0617_0005_0005$$$::all it needs to draw in food is to walk around at night.::
66716::$$$message_0617_0006_0000$$$::It eats.[lr]::
66717::$$$message_0617_0006_0001$$$::At first, it ate in a rush, but it's gotten the hang of this.[lr]::
66718::$$$message_0617_0006_0002$$$::There's no need to hurry.[lr]::
66719::$$$message_0617_0006_0003$$$::Once they're pulled in by their feet, it's over.[lr]::
66720::$$$message_0617_0006_0004$$$::It eats up their heart and mind without leaving a single drop.::
66721::$$$message_0617_0007_0000$$$::Giggle and sing, go-go.[lr]::
66722::$$$message_0617_0007_0001$$$::It's in a good mood tonight.[lr]::
66723::$$$message_0617_0007_0002$$$::Even though it's never shown any emotion before now, it's giddy tonight.::
66724::$$$message_0617_0008_0000$$$::That makes me feel closer to it, too.[lr]::
66725::$$$message_0617_0008_0001$$$::I'm very happy tonight.[lr]::
66726::$$$message_0617_0008_0002$$$::After all, it's the first time.[lr]::
66727::$$$message_0617_0008_0003$$$::The first time Senpai sought me out himself.[lr]::
66728::$$$message_0617_0008_0004$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
66729::$$$message_0617_0008_0005$$$::So there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.[lr]::
66730::$$$message_0617_0008_0006$$$::I'll still have these scary dreams, but they're no problem at all.[lr]::
66731::$$$message_0617_0008_0007$$$::The world seems so beautiful and kind because Senpai is looking at me.::
66732::$$$message_0617_0009_0000$$$::So, I start to think that even this bad dream could go on a little longer, and I set out in search of my next meal.[lr]::
66733::$$$message_0617_0009_0001$$$::Unfortunately,[lr]::
66734::$$$message_0617_0009_0002$$$::"Working hard, I see. You've taken double your usual number, tonight."[lr]::
66735::$$$message_0617_0009_0003$$$::I run into someone who's even scarier than this dream.::
66736::$$$message_0617_0010_0000$$$::I run away.[lr]::
66737::$$$message_0617_0010_0001$$$::The [font italic=true]thing[font italic=false] has never been afraid of anything before, but it flees in terror from this man.[lr]::
66738::$$$message_0617_0010_0002$$$::Golden hair and red eyes.[lr]::
66739::$$$message_0617_0010_0003$$$::He smells like me.[lr]::
66740::$$$message_0617_0010_0004$$$::I've seen him before, once.[lr]::
66741::$$$message_0617_0010_0005$$$::"Die while you can, girl. Once it takes a liking to you, you won't even be able to do that."[lr]::
66742::$$$message_0617_0010_0006$$$::He's the golden Servant who warned me to kill myself.::

66750::$$$message_0617_0012_0000$$$::My dream won't end.[lr]::
66751::$$$message_0617_0012_0001$$$::The [font italic=true]thing[font italic=false] looks so pitiful as it panics and runs into an alleyway.[lr]::
66752::$$$message_0617_0012_0002$$$::It's all over for it now.[lr]::
66753::$$$message_0617_0012_0003$$$::"I took you for a failed Holy Grail, but you've become far more complete than I anticipated. It's too bad, really."::
66754::$$$message_0617_0013_0000$$$::"It is I who will carry out the selection. Before you die, curse yourself for being too suitable."[lr]::
66755::$$$message_0617_0013_0001$$$::In an instant, countless blades stab the [font italic=true]thing[font italic=false].::
66756::$$$message_0617_0014_0000$$$::...Huh?[lr]::
66757::$$$message_0617_0014_0001$$$::That's weird. It hurts.[lr]::
66758::$$$message_0617_0014_0002$$$::She's the one who got stabbed, so why am I in pain when I'm watching from over here?[lr]::
66759::$$$message_0617_0014_0003$$$::She's the one who's dying, so why am I on the ground?[lr]::
66760::$$$message_0617_0014_0004$$$::I'm the one who's dreaming, so why...::
66761::$$$message_0617_0015_0000$$$::                                           Why is my body cut to ribbons?::
66762::$$$message_0617_0016_0000$$$::"H...uh?"[lr]::
66763::$$$message_0617_0016_0001$$$::Ouch.[lr]::
66764::$$$message_0617_0016_0002$$$::I'm in a dream, but it hurts, Senpai.[lr]::
66765::$$$message_0617_0016_0003$$$::Something's spilling out of my stomach. I must look so pathetic.::
66766::$$$message_0617_0017_0000$$$::"It...hurts."[lr]::
66767::$$$message_0617_0017_0001$$$::I try to put the squishy things back inside, but my hands are playing somewhere else.[lr]::
66768::$$$message_0617_0017_0002$$$::My feet... I have feet, but the body they're attached to is dangling around.::
66769::$$$message_0617_0018_0000$$$::"No..."[lr]::

66772::$$$message_0617_0018_0003$$$::Why am I...::

66775::$$$message_0617_0020_0001$$$::The golden man snaps a finger, and a blade bigger than my own body chops my head off.::
66776::$$$message_0617_0021_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
66777::$$$message_0617_0021_0001$$$::A nightmare.[lr]::
66778::$$$message_0617_0021_0002$$$::This is a nightmare.[lr]::
66779::$$$message_0617_0021_0003$$$::It's just like the dreams I've had so far.[lr]::
66780::$$$message_0617_0021_0004$$$::It isn't really happening. Once I open my eyes, I'll be back in Senpai's house.::
66781::$$$message_0617_0022_0000$$$::...See? I'm about to wake up.[lr]::
66782::$$$message_0617_0022_0001$$$::Because it hurts so much.[lr]::
66783::$$$message_0617_0022_0002$$$::It hurts so much I want to die, so unless I wake up, I really will...!::
66784::$$$message_0617_0023_0000$$$::"Ah... Argh, ahhh!!!"[lr]::
66785::$$$message_0617_0023_0001$$$::But I can't wake up.[lr]::
66786::$$$message_0617_0023_0002$$$::I can't wake up from this dream.[lr]::

66788::$$$message_0617_0023_0004$$$::Help, it hurts, help, help.[lr]::
66789::$$$message_0617_0023_0005$$$::I need to hurry and wake up or else it'll take me with it[line4]::
66790::$$$message_0617_0024_0000$$$::But I can't wake up.[lr]::
66791::$$$message_0617_0024_0001$$$::I can't wake up from this dream.[lr]::
66792::$$$message_0617_0024_0002$$$::This dream.[lr]::
66793::$$$message_0617_0024_0003$$$::I can't get out of this dream, Senpai[line4]::
66794::$$$message_0617_0025_0000$$$::    And then, the woman falls.[lr]::
66795::$$$message_0617_0025_0001$$$::She sprawls on the ground like an insect pinned to a museum plaque, her entire body skewered by Noble Phantasms.::
66796::$$$message_0617_0026_0000$$$::"Huh...?"::
66797::$$$message_0617_0027_0000$$$::The woman is still conscious.[lr]::
66798::$$$message_0617_0027_0001$$$::Her life is far beyond saving, but she doesn't know when to quit, and keeps trying to move her limbs.::
66799::$$$message_0617_0028_0000$$$::"Hmph. Still breathing? How filthily you cling to life, girl."[lr]::
66800::$$$message_0617_0028_0001$$$::He hands down her death sentence with disdain.[lr]::
66801::$$$message_0617_0028_0002$$$::The golden man[line2]the Heroic Spirit named Gilgamesh mercilessly lets the final stroke fall.::
66802::$$$message_0617_0029_0000$$$::"Don't...want to...die... Senpai finally...looked at...me... I wanted him to...touch me...more..."::
66803::$$$message_0617_0030_0000$$$::The woman must not be seeing anything anymore.[lr]::
66804::$$$message_0617_0030_0001$$$::As if in a trance, she speaks a mundane wish in her final moments.[lr]::
66805::$$$message_0617_0030_0002$$$::Finally.[lr]::
66806::$$$message_0617_0030_0003$$$::Just when she'd finally grabbed hold of a small sliver of happiness, reaching for that shred of cloth,::

66808::$$$message_0617_0031_0001$$$::Because...if I die now, Nee-san will take him...!"::
66809::$$$message_0617_0032_0000$$$::"You offend my sight. How dare you make me work so hard."[lr]::
66810::$$$message_0617_0032_0001$$$::The executioner's sword falls.[lr]::
66811::$$$message_0617_0032_0002$$$::The dream is over.[lr]::
66812::$$$message_0617_0032_0003$$$::The woman's mind sinks into a pool of blood and disappears into the dirty alley floor, never to wake again.::
66813::$$$message_0617_0033_0000$$$::"...Mm?"[lr]::
66814::$$$message_0617_0033_0001$$$::By the time he turns around, it's too late.::
66815::$$$message_0617_0034_0000$$$::"You[line2]you've already grown this fa[line2]!?!?!?"[lr]::
66816::$$$message_0617_0034_0001$$$::It consumes him from his feet.[lr]::
66817::$$$message_0617_0034_0002$$$::There's no escape.[lr]::
66818::$$$message_0617_0034_0003$$$::Because he's already[line2]::
66819::$$$message_0617_0035_0000$$$::                                          It takes a while longer than usual.::
66820::$$$message_0617_0036_0000$$$::                                "...It hurts. I don't have much, so I can't heal."::
66821::$$$message_0617_0037_0000$$$::She starts walking.[lr]::
66822::$$$message_0617_0037_0001$$$::Her stomach is growling.[lr]::
66823::$$$message_0617_0037_0002$$$::The only thought that drives her is hunger.[lr]::
66824::$$$message_0617_0037_0003$$$::Even the King of Heroes, worth hundreds of thousands of souls, isn't enough to sate her?::
66825::$$$message_0617_0038_0000$$$::                                         "...Not enough. This isn't enough."[r]::
66826::$$$message_0617_0039_0000$$$::She cries out as if in a fever dream.[lr]::
66827::$$$message_0617_0039_0001$$$::But this is no dream.[lr]::
66828::$$$message_0617_0039_0002$$$::It's the first time she goes into the breeding cage on her own.::
