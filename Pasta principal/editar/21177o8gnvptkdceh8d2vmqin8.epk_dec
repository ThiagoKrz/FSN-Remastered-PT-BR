53164::$$$message_0459_0000_0000$$$::The moon wanes.[lr]::
53165::$$$message_0459_0000_0001$$$::A strong wind brings clouds that cover its pale brilliance.::
53166::$$$message_0459_0001_0000$$$::I step outside quietly, to let Sakura rest.[lr]::
53167::$$$message_0459_0001_0001$$$::It's 10:00 PM. We're starting our patrol early to make up for yesterday.::
53168::$$$message_0459_0002_0000$$$::After we beat Caster, I got complacent, and that led to more innocent casualties.[lr]::
53169::$$$message_0459_0002_0001$$$::If she's still alive and going after more civilians, then I need to settle this for good tonight.::
53170::$$$message_0459_0003_0000$$$::We go down the hill and arrive at the intersection.[lr]::
53171::$$$message_0459_0003_0001$$$::The question is where to go from here...::
53172::$$$message_0459_0004_0000$$$::"Shirou. I sense a Servant."[lr]::
53173::$$$message_0459_0004_0001$$$::"...! Are they close, Saber?"[lr]::
53174::$$$message_0459_0004_0002$$$::"Distance is of no concern. Even taking your speed into account, we can catch up to them in about five minutes if we hurry.[lr]::
53175::$$$message_0459_0004_0003$$$::What are your orders, Master?"::
53176::$$$message_0459_0005_0000$$$::Saber's asking me whether we should pursue or observe the enemy.[lr]::
53177::$$$message_0459_0005_0001$$$::I don't even need to think about it.::
53178::$$$message_0459_0006_0000$$$::"Let's go. Lead the way, Saber."[lr]::
53179::$$$message_0459_0006_0001$$$::Saber starts running.[lr]::
53180::$$$message_0459_0006_0002$$$::It looks like she's headed east, toward the big bridge connecting Miyama and Shinto.::
53181::$$$message_0459_0007_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
53182::$$$message_0459_0007_0001$$$::The instant I step foot into the park, I'm assailed by a nauseating aura.[lr]::
53183::$$$message_0459_0007_0002$$$::The air feels tainted.[lr]::
53184::$$$message_0459_0007_0003$$$::A rotting odor reaches my nostrils.::
53185::$$$message_0459_0008_0000$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
53186::$$$message_0459_0008_0001$$$::Just being here is enough to turn my stomach.[lr]::
53187::$$$message_0459_0008_0002$$$::Light dizziness and a discomfort in my throat tears at my consciousness.::
53188::$$$message_0459_0009_0000$$$::"Shirou, over there!"[lr]::
53189::$$$message_0459_0009_0001$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
53190::$$$message_0459_0009_0002$$$::I fight down the nausea and look across the park.[lr]::
53191::$$$message_0459_0009_0003$$$::There, I see...::
53192::$$$message_0459_0010_0000$$$::"E-Emiya!?"[lr]::
53193::$$$message_0459_0010_0001$$$::Tohsaka and Archer, their backs to us, and...[lr]::
53194::$$$message_0459_0010_0002$$$::"Hm? It seems we have visitors."[lr]::
53195::$$$message_0459_0010_0003$$$::That old man: Zouken Matou.::
53196::$$$message_0459_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
53197::$$$message_0459_0011_0001$$$::One look is enough to understand the situation.[lr]::
53198::$$$message_0459_0011_0002$$$::Tohsaka and Zouken are fighting.::
53199::$$$message_0459_0012_0000$$$::Dozens of small, indistinct things are scattered at Tohsaka's feet.[lr]::
53200::$$$message_0459_0012_0001$$$::Several times their number surround Archer.[lr]::
53201::$$$message_0459_0012_0002$$$::Zouken must be using some kind of magecraft to attack them.::
53202::$$$message_0459_0013_0000$$$::"Oh? If it isn't the Master of Saber.[lr]::
53203::$$$message_0459_0013_0001$$$::Well, good heavens. The Tohsaka girl is a smart one, to have reinforcements at the ready."::
53204::$$$message_0459_0014_0000$$$::"Obviously not. Archer and I are enough to hold you down and make you spill your guts.[lr]::
53205::$$$message_0459_0014_0001$$$::That's just an observer. He has nothing to do with me."[lr]::
53206::$$$message_0459_0014_0002$$$::Tohsaka stays focused on Zouken, not paying us a second thought.::
53207::$$$message_0459_0015_0000$$$::...Or so I expected.[lr]::
53208::$$$message_0459_0015_0001$$$::"What the heck are you doing here at a time like this? Are you trying to get yourself killed!?"[lr]::
53209::$$$message_0459_0015_0002$$$::She hisses a fresh round of complaints at me.::
53210::$$$message_0459_0016_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
53211::$$$message_0459_0016_0001$$$::"...I know. This isn't the time to fight Tohsaka and Archer."[lr]::
53212::$$$message_0459_0016_0002$$$::I feel danger from the old man, just as Tohsaka won't take her eyes off him.::
53213::$$$message_0459_0017_0000$$$::...He's a monster that lives off human blood.[lr]::
53214::$$$message_0459_0017_0001$$$::A descendant of the Makiris trying to acquire the Holy Grail, and the person who made Shinji into a Master.[lr]::
53215::$$$message_0459_0017_0002$$$::I can't just stand aside and let this fight play out.::
53216::$$$message_0459_0018_0000$$$::"Hm. I hoped to keep this secret, but you leave me little choice. I doubt I can survive a battle against two Servants, after all."::
53217::$$$message_0459_0019_0000$$$::The cane in his hand rings out.[lr]::
53218::$$$message_0459_0019_0001$$$::With a thud, he plants his arcane-looking cane onto the brick ground,[lr]::
53219::$$$message_0459_0019_0002$$$::and instantly, something that should be dead appears to defend the old man.::
53220::$$$message_0459_0020_0000$$$::"Caster! Damn it, she's really still alive!"[lr]::
53221::$$$message_0459_0020_0001$$$::"Stand back, Shirou. That thing is Caster, yet not Caster... Its appearance and abilities remain, but I don't feel a soul giving it thought.[lr]::
53222::$$$message_0459_0020_0002$$$::It is merely an imitation wearing Caster's corpse."::
53223::$$$message_0459_0021_0000$$$::Saber steps forward,[lr]::
53224::$$$message_0459_0021_0001$$$::invisible sword at the ready.::
53225::$$$message_0459_0022_0000$$$::"Impressive, Saber. You figured out my puppet in a single glance. No wonder Shinji and Rider didn't stand a chance.[lr]::
53226::$$$message_0459_0022_0001$$$::Just as Caster fell to you with little resistance, I doubt Archer would fare much better."::
53227::$$$message_0459_0023_0000$$$::"Is that all you have to say?[lr]::
53228::$$$message_0459_0023_0001$$$::You have done more than deceive us.[lr]::
53229::$$$message_0459_0023_0002$$$::Though we may be foes, Caster was a Heroic Spirit chosen to be a Servant. You must be prepared for the consequences of humiliating her corpse."::
53230::$$$message_0459_0024_0000$$$::"Now, now. I simply picked up something that was no longer in use.[lr]::
53231::$$$message_0459_0024_0001$$$::You might consider that abhorrent, Saber, but I have something even more fiendish in store for you.[lr]::
53232::$$$message_0459_0024_0002$$$::You are the supreme Servant.[lr]::
53233::$$$message_0459_0024_0003$$$::That makes you a far greater prize to break than this pile of bones. I will feed your flesh to my worms and give you a fate just like her corpse."::
53234::$$$message_0459_0025_0000$$$::"You wretch..."[lr]::
53235::$$$message_0459_0025_0001$$$::"Ha ha ha. Why so angry? Servants are ultimately tools to be used as their lord sees fit! It is no different from being bound by Command Spells after death. Why, you should thank me for turning you into mindless puppets!"::
53236::$$$message_0459_0026_0000$$$::   Both Servants charge.[lr]::
53237::$$$message_0459_0026_0001$$$::As if in unspoken agreement, Saber and Archer race forward to cut down the cackling fiend.::
53238::$$$message_0459_0027_0000$$$::Two bladed gusts descend upon Caster.[lr]::
53239::$$$message_0459_0027_0001$$$::The result was obvious from the start.::
53240::$$$message_0459_0028_0000$$$::Caster can't beat Saber.[lr]::
53241::$$$message_0459_0028_0001$$$::Even if Zouken pulls her strings, her disadvantage is still clear.[lr]::
53242::$$$message_0459_0028_0002$$$::Unscathed by Caster's magecraft, Saber finishes off her opponent for the second time.::
53243::$$$message_0459_0029_0000$$$::The dead Servant's husk collapses.[lr]::
53244::$$$message_0459_0029_0001$$$::Saber stands over Caster's remains, observing her final moments.::
53245::$$$message_0459_0030_0000$$$::She makes absolutely sure that Caster is gone, back from whence she came,[lr]::
53246::$$$message_0459_0030_0001$$$::so that her corpse will never be misused by a mortal mage.::
53247::$$$message_0459_0031_0000$$$::"Archer...!"[lr]::
53248::$$$message_0459_0031_0001$$$::That's Tohsaka's voice.[lr]::
53249::$$$message_0459_0031_0002$$$::I turn to see that Zouken has disappeared.[lr]::
53250::$$$message_0459_0031_0003$$$::He must have sacrificed Caster as a distraction to aid his escape.[lr]::
53251::$$$message_0459_0031_0004$$$::But...::
53252::$$$message_0459_0032_0000$$$::"Mmgh!?"[lr]::
53253::$$$message_0459_0032_0001$$$::Saber saw it coming and was ready for Caster.::
53254::$$$message_0459_0033_0000$$$::Archer was never after Caster to begin with.[lr]::
53255::$$$message_0459_0033_0001$$$::He was focused on her puppeteer, instead.[lr]::
53256::$$$message_0459_0033_0002$$$::"That's enough."[lr]::
53257::$$$message_0459_0033_0003$$$::Without hesitation, he cleaves through Zouken's body.::
53258::$$$message_0459_0034_0000$$$::"Mgh!"[lr]::
53259::$$$message_0459_0034_0001$$$::Zouken's upper body crumples to the ground.::
53260::$$$message_0459_0035_0000$$$::"Mngh, ugh, oh my...!"[lr]::
53261::$$$message_0459_0035_0001$$$::I hear a slithering sound.[lr]::
53262::$$$message_0459_0035_0002$$$::The old man, missing his body from the waist down, slithers along the ground, leaking some gruesome substance.::
53263::$$$message_0459_0036_0000$$$::"You're finished, mage. I've been around long enough to know that fiends like you need to be dealt with quickly."::
53264::$$$message_0459_0037_0000$$$::Archer's short sword cuts upward in a second arc.[lr]::
53265::$$$message_0459_0037_0001$$$::That'll finish Zouken.[lr]::
53266::$$$message_0459_0037_0002$$$::No matter how immortal he is, he'll die if you crush his head. He was already on the verge of death, anyway.::
53267::$$$message_0459_0038_0000$$$::Without natural healing abilities like those of a servant, severe wounds hasten his death by the second.[lr]::
53268::$$$message_0459_0038_0001$$$::Archer goes in for a killing blow to make absolutely certain the mage is dead.::
53269::$$$message_0459_0039_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
53270::$$$message_0459_0039_0001$$$::No[line2]he tries to, but he freezes in his tracks.::
53271::$$$message_0459_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
53272::$$$message_0459_0040_0001$$$::Archer isn't the only one who senses it.[lr]::
53273::$$$message_0459_0040_0002$$$::Everybody here does.[lr]::
53274::$$$message_0459_0040_0003$$$::Tohsaka and Saber...[lr]::
53275::$$$message_0459_0040_0004$$$::Archer and I...[lr]::
53276::$$$message_0459_0040_0005$$$::Even the dying Zouken trembles in astonishment at its sudden appearance.::
53277::$$$message_0459_0041_0000$$$::    The park becomes inky black.::
53278::$$$message_0459_0042_0000$$$::The damp air freezes over instantly.[lr]::
53279::$$$message_0459_0042_0001$$$::Even my pounding heart begins to slow.[lr]::
53280::$$$message_0459_0042_0002$$$::Something [font italic=true]bad[font italic=false] is nearby.[lr]::
53281::$$$message_0459_0042_0003$$$::I have to run.[lr]::
53282::$$$message_0459_0042_0004$$$::I can't be around it.[lr]::
53283::$$$message_0459_0042_0005$$$::My body understands this even better than my brain, but it rejects my commands to flee.::
53284::$$$message_0459_0043_0000$$$::It knows that running is futile.[lr]::
53285::$$$message_0459_0043_0001$$$::It rules out escape as an option, because there's no getting away once you run into that thing.::
53286::$$$message_0459_0044_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
53287::$$$message_0459_0044_0001$$$::I tremble. My paralyzed neck begins to move.[lr]::
53288::$$$message_0459_0044_0002$$$::My eyes track to the park entrance.[lr]::
53289::$$$message_0459_0044_0003$$$::    There...[lr]::
53290::$$$message_0459_0044_0004$$$::...stands a [font italic=true]Shadow[font italic=false].::
53291::$$$message_0459_0045_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
53292::$$$message_0459_0045_0001$$$::Space twists.[lr]::
53293::$$$message_0459_0045_0002$$$::I'd like to believe that I'm just hallucinating, that I'm losing my grip on reality due to extreme distress.::
53294::$$$message_0459_0046_0000$$$::Whatever that is, I've never seen anything like it.[lr]::
53295::$$$message_0459_0046_0001$$$::The Shadow stands there, upright and ethereal.[lr]::
53296::$$$message_0459_0046_0002$$$::It seems light enough to be blown away by a breeze.[lr]::
53297::$$$message_0459_0046_0003$$$::But its gravity is more commanding than anything else here.::
53298::$$$message_0459_0047_0000$$$::It has no intellect, no reason. It isn't even a living creature.[lr]::
53299::$$$message_0459_0047_0001$$$::The black Shadow stays where it is, piercing the night like a skyscraper.[lr]::
53300::$$$message_0459_0047_0002$$$::And for some reason...::
53301::$$$message_0459_0048_0000$$$::                                         I find the sight...nostalgic.::
53302::$$$message_0459_0049_0000$$$::"Impossible."[lr]::
53303::$$$message_0459_0049_0001$$$::I hear a hoarse, wizened voice.[lr]::
53304::$$$message_0459_0049_0002$$$::The only person who manages to talk is the dying old man.::
53305::$$$message_0459_0050_0000$$$::"Impossible. Inconceivable. This cannot be!"[lr]::
53306::$$$message_0459_0050_0001$$$::He crawls away, wailing.[lr]::
53307::$$$message_0459_0050_0002$$$::Zouken Matou flees from Archer's sword and leaves the park as fast as he can.::
53308::$$$message_0459_0051_0000$$$::...It isn't because he had stamina to spare.[lr]::
53309::$$$message_0459_0051_0001$$$::It's simple...[lr]::
53310::$$$message_0459_0051_0002$$$::His wholehearted fear of the sinister Shadow was enough to whip his wasted carcass into action.::
53311::$$$message_0459_0052_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
53312::$$$message_0459_0052_0001$$$::Nobody can move.[lr]::
53313::$$$message_0459_0052_0002$$$::Tohsaka and I tremble.[lr]::
53314::$$$message_0459_0052_0003$$$::Saber and Archer are frozen still, as if mesmerized by something.[lr]::
53315::$$$message_0459_0052_0004$$$::    It's a monster of the deep sea.[lr]::
53316::$$$message_0459_0052_0005$$$::In the completely stopped, silent world, only the shadow sways.::
53317::$$$message_0459_0053_0000$$$::And for the first time,[lr]::
53318::$$$message_0459_0053_0001$$$::it shows signs of having a will.::
53319::$$$message_0459_0054_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
53320::$$$message_0459_0054_0001$$$::It has no eyes, no limbs, no body.[lr]::
53321::$$$message_0459_0054_0002$$$::And yet, a shadow stretches out from its "feet."[lr]::
53322::$$$message_0459_0054_0003$$$::It casts a long, long shade under the moonlight.[lr]::
53323::$$$message_0459_0054_0004$$$::Slowly, it turns to point at Tohsaka, like a snake that just discovered prey.::
53324::$$$message_0459_0055_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
53325::$$$message_0459_0055_0001$$$::Tohsaka can't move. She hasn't noticed the change in the Shadow.[lr]::
53326::$$$message_0459_0055_0002$$$::Saber is too far. Archer starts running,::
53327::$$$message_0459_0056_0000$$$::"Toh[line2]"[lr]::
53328::$$$message_0459_0056_0001$$$::The Shadow stretches.[lr]::
53329::$$$message_0459_0056_0002$$$::Suddenly and without warning, it covers dozens of meters.::
53330::$$$message_0459_0057_0000$$$::"[line2]saka, look out!!!"[lr]::
53331::$$$message_0459_0057_0001$$$::I frantically shove her aside.::
53332::$$$message_0459_0058_0000$$$::"......ya!?"[lr]::
53333::$$$message_0459_0058_0001$$$::I can't hear her voice.[lr]::
53334::$$$message_0459_0058_0002$$$::The instant I push Tohsaka, something incomprehensible swallows me.[lr]::
53335::$$$message_0459_0058_0003$$$::I hear a splash and feel something crushing my body.::
53336::$$$message_0459_0059_0000$$$::"..., ...Ah..."::
53337::$$$message_0459_0060_0000$$$::So my hunch wasn't wrong.[lr]::
53338::$$$message_0459_0060_0001$$$::A torrent of liquid, like having a dump truck emptied on me, submerges me from head to toe. I'm in the deep ocean now.::
53339::$$$message_0459_0061_0000$$$::But it's hot.[lr]::
53340::$$$message_0459_0061_0001$$$::This is way too hot for seawater.[lr]::
53341::$$$message_0459_0061_0002$$$::It's boiling coal tar.[lr]::
53342::$$$message_0459_0061_0003$$$::It sticks to my skin, shutting me off from my basic life functions. Rather than being underwater, it's like...::
53343::$$$message_0459_0062_0000$$$::"Ah...vrgh..."[lr]::
53344::$$$message_0459_0062_0001$$$::I feel nauseous. Repulsed.[lr]::
53345::$$$message_0459_0062_0002$$$::I feel nauseous. Repulsed. Nauseous. HAHAHA! R-repulsed. N-n-nau[line2][lr]¿.iO
