44702::$$$message_0397_0000_0001$$$::But I'm thinking that...maybe I should..."[lr]::
44703::$$$message_0397_0000_0002$$$::"Take on Gilgamesh, right?[lr]::
44704::$$$message_0397_0000_0003$$$::...I'm surprised, so you did notice. The only thing that could counter Gilgamesh's Noble Phantasm...is Archer's magecraft."::
44705::$$$message_0397_0001_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
44706::$$$message_0397_0001_0001$$$::My jaw dropped.::
44707::$$$message_0397_0002_0000$$$::"What do you mean what? [wait canskip=0 time=500][chgfg textoff=0 time=300 storage=凛私服06a(中)]Don't tell me... You were thinking of something crazy like that without even realizing the most important part?"[lr]::
44708::$$$message_0397_0002_0001$$$::"Well...I wouldn't say that. I didn't have concrete evidence but I had a feeling that maybe I have the best chance against him..."::
44709::$$$message_0397_0003_0000$$$::"...Hmmm, I see. I'm not sure who gave you the idea, but you weren't wrong about that.[lr]::
44710::$$$message_0397_0003_0001$$$::What makes Gilgamesh the most powerful Servant is the number of his Noble Phantasms. But following the same line of thought, whoever possesses the same amount of Noble Phantasms could potentially go up against him."[lr]::
44711::$$$message_0397_0003_0002$$$::"...Same amount of Noble Phantasms."[lr]::
44712::$$$message_0397_0003_0003$$$::Basically, I just need to copy every single one of his weapons as soon as he unleashes them.::
44713::$$$message_0397_0004_0000$$$::"...That's right. I know he mocks you and calls you two fakers, but I'm sure that's just because he sees you two as threats. He has no choice but to admit that Heroic Spirit Emiya gets to fight him on the same ground."[lr]::
44714::$$$message_0397_0004_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
44715::$$$message_0397_0004_0002$$$::That's true, but...::
44716::$$$message_0397_0005_0000$$$::"Maybe that's the case, but there's a limit.[lr]::
44717::$$$message_0397_0005_0001$$$::He can tell that as soon as I Project one of Archer's swords. There's no way I can Project fast enough and I don't have enough magical energy to do so."[lr]::
44718::$$$message_0397_0005_0002$$$::"That's only if your magecraft stays the same as before.[lr]::
44719::$$$message_0397_0005_0003$$$::But you do remember what Archer's Noble Phantasm is, right?[lr]::
44720::$$$message_0397_0005_0004$$$::That magecraft... As long as you can master that Reality Marble, you will have a chance against Gilgamesh."::
44721::$$$message_0397_0006_0000$$$::Tohsaka stares at me with high expectations.[lr]::
44722::$$$message_0397_0006_0001$$$::Unfortunately, I can't answer her expectations.::
44723::$$$message_0397_0007_0000$$$::"No way. Reality Marble is forbidden even amongst the most dangerous spells, right? Besides I don't know how to do it, and I don't even have a fraction of the magical energy needed when Archer created his world."::
44724::$$$message_0397_0008_0000$$$::"I know it'd be difficult.[lr]::
44725::$$$message_0397_0008_0001$$$::However, you should already know how to do it. That's because your magecraft all originates from it. Whether it's Strengthening or Projection, it's just a byproduct of your Reality Marble.[lr]::
44726::$$$message_0397_0008_0002$$$::As long as you have enough magical energy, I'm sure even you'll be surprised at how gears just fall into places by themselves."::
44727::$$$message_0397_0009_0000$$$::"Even if that's the case, it still doesn't change the impossible. I don't have the magical energy to put up or sustain the Reality Marble. [lr]::
44728::$$$message_0397_0009_0001$$$::I'm sure Archer spent his lifetime strengthening his Magic Circuits, but I don't have what he has..."::
44729::$$$message_0397_0010_0000$$$::"I understand.[lr]::
44730::$$$message_0397_0010_0001$$$::But Gilgamesh said so too, remember? A true mage would compensate for what's lacking in themselves from elsewhere."::
44731::$$$message_0397_0011_0000$$$::"Listen to me, I'm not skilled enough to try to siphon magical energy from other places, and I don't know how to store my magical energy into gems like you.[lr]::
44732::$$$message_0397_0011_0001$$$::...Wait, are you asking me to use those gems?"[lr]::
44733::$$$message_0397_0011_0002$$$::Of course, I don't think she'll agree to that seeing that I don't have any training in magecraft to be able to utilize those gems.::
44734::$$$message_0397_0012_0000$$$::"If that worked, I would've given you the gems already. Besides, only I'm capable of transferring those gems into energy so no, that wouldn't work.[lr]::
44735::$$$message_0397_0012_0001$$$::...But, maybe that's our only approach.[lr]::
44736::$$$message_0397_0012_0002$$$::There are a lot of steps we have to take in order to make someone else's magical energy your own, but I think that's the only option we're left with considering our situation..."::
44737::$$$message_0397_0013_0000$$$::"...Hey, Tohsaka. You mind sharing what's on your mind? I can't help if you don't tell me what's going on."[lr]::
44738::$$$message_0397_0013_0001$$$::"What? [wait canskip=0 time=600][chgfg textoff=0 time=300 storage=凛私服14a(中)]Th-there's no way I can tell you about something like that!::
44739::$$$message_0397_0014_0000$$$::...Hmmm.[lr]::
44740::$$$message_0397_0014_0001$$$::It seems she's thinking about something that's hard to tell me.::
44741::$$$message_0397_0015_0000$$$::"I-it's nothing.[lr]::
44742::$$$message_0397_0015_0001$$$::There are a couple of options, but I simply went through the process of elimination and got rid of the ones with a low chance of success..."[lr]::
44743::$$$message_0397_0015_0002$$$::"Is that so? Then does that mean you have a good plan now?"::
44744::$$$message_0397_0016_0000$$$::"Well...to be honest, this is a problem between me and you.[lr]::
44745::$$$message_0397_0016_0001$$$::There's a way to connect two mages' pools of magical energy together to make this work."::
44746::$$$message_0397_0017_0000$$$::"...So it would be like creating a path for the magical energy to pass through between us?"[lr]::
44747::$$$message_0397_0017_0001$$$::"Right. Even if you don't have enough magical energy for your Reality Marble, I do.[lr]::
44748::$$$message_0397_0017_0002$$$::You will use my magical energy to fight Gilgamesh, and Saber and I will destroy the Holy Grail during that time. I have Saber with me so we should be okay on our end even if I'm short on some magical energy."::
44749::$$$message_0397_0018_0000$$$::If I can use my Reality Marble to hold Gilgamesh back, without any other Servants and Masters, the Holy Grail is left wide open.[lr]::
44750::$$$message_0397_0018_0001$$$::Tohsaka being a mage and having Saber by her side, our chance of success is high enough.::
44751::$$$message_0397_0019_0000$$$::"...But that brings another issue, the hard part is the step before that. I don't know how to create a path for magical energy to pass through."[lr]::
44752::$$$message_0397_0019_0001$$$::"That much I'm aware. It'll be up to me to think of a way."::
44753::$$$message_0397_0020_0000$$$::Tohsaka is thinking of something.[lr]::
44754::$$$message_0397_0020_0001$$$::But she doesn't look optimistic about it.::
44755::$$$message_0397_0021_0000$$$::"About creating a path, there's only a handful of methods that are immediate and can allow magical energy to pass through.[lr]::
44756::$$$message_0397_0021_0001$$$::The most effective one would be to transplant our Magic Circuits into each other."::
44757::$$$message_0397_0022_0000$$$::...Transplant our Magic Circuits into each other?[lr]::
44758::$$$message_0397_0022_0001$$$::Magic Circuits are secondary pseudo-nerves that can be said to define a mage.[lr]::
44759::$$$message_0397_0022_0002$$$::Using od to exert influence on mana, the core mechanism of a mage.[lr]::
44760::$$$message_0397_0022_0003$$$::It's a "living inheritance" to make sure one's bloodline can have the foundation necessary to realize their family's great work when they've reached the pinnacle.[lr]::
44761::$$$message_0397_0022_0004$$$::You can say it's like one's blood and bone that strengthen as time goes on.::
44762::$$$message_0397_0023_0000$$$::"...Magic Circuits, like the ones in you and me?"[lr]::
44763::$$$message_0397_0023_0001$$$::"Yes. If we transplant our essences as mages to each other, it would guarantee a path.[lr]::
44764::$$$message_0397_0023_0002$$$::There's no easier way to transfer your magical energy to someone else when you have part of their circuit as your own."::
44765::$$$message_0397_0024_0000$$$::Her explanation is short and simple, yet contains a sense of guilt.[lr]::
44766::$$$message_0397_0024_0001$$$::...Of course it would. I can't even begin to imagine the consequences of doing something as crazy as transplanting your Magic Circuits into someone else.[lr]::
44767::$$$message_0397_0024_0002$$$::For a person to offer their own Magic Circuits to be transplanted, it also means they're giving up their integrity as a mage.[lr]::
44768::$$$message_0397_0024_0003$$$::But that makes this easier.::
44769::$$$message_0397_0025_0000$$$::"Okay, I will give you my Magic Circuits."[lr]::
44770::$$$message_0397_0025_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
44771::$$$message_0397_0025_0002$$$::"Wh-what, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
44772::$$$message_0397_0025_0003$$$::"I'm happy that you'd think that, but that's meaningless."::
44773::$$$message_0397_0026_0000$$$::Right in my face.[lr]::
44774::$$$message_0397_0026_0001$$$::She just ends up throwing my resolve right back in my face.::
44775::$$$message_0397_0027_0000$$$::"Wh-why?"[lr]::
44776::$$$message_0397_0027_0001$$$::"Look. The reason why we're even talking about all this is so we can use your Reality Marble, right? Then why would we want to weaken your circuit?[lr]::
44777::$$$message_0397_0027_0002$$$::Using the Reality Marble is only possible when we fully exert all of our Magic Circuits."[lr]::
44778::$$$message_0397_0027_0003$$$::"..."::
44779::$$$message_0397_0028_0000$$$::...I see.[lr]::
44780::$$$message_0397_0028_0001$$$::I'm the one who will use the Reality Marble. I will only barely be able to create a fantasy big enough to corrode the world itself when I fully exert my Magic Circuits.[lr]::
44781::$$$message_0397_0028_0002$$$::If I were to transplant some of my Magic Circuits into Tohsaka to create a path, then I wouldn't have enough circuits to perform my magecraft, which would defeat the purpose.::
44782::$$$message_0397_0029_0000$$$::"Got it?[lr]::
44783::$$$message_0397_0029_0001$$$::That would be like spending all of this effort to just make us weaker, Shirou."[lr]::
44784::$$$message_0397_0029_0002$$$::"I'm sorry, I didn't think that far ahead."[lr]::
44785::$$$message_0397_0029_0003$$$::"It's ok, no need to apologize. I thought you would come up with something like that. I didn't expect you would say it so quickly though."::
44786::$$$message_0397_0030_0000$$$::"…So, we transplant your Magic Circuits into me?"[lr]::
44787::$$$message_0397_0030_0001$$$::But that also means...[lr]::
44788::$$$message_0397_0030_0002$$$::"...It's true that instead of transplanting your circuit into me, the reverse would better secure our chances.[lr]::
44789::$$$message_0397_0030_0003$$$::However, I'm the one performing the ritual for the transplant. Taking part of the circuit away while using it can't guarantee the stability of the ritual itself. [lr]::
44790::$$$message_0397_0030_0004$$$::My mind would be more at ease if this was standardized like the ritual we perform to form contracts with our familiars. But creating a path of magical energy between two mages is not something that happens everyday."::
44791::$$$message_0397_0031_0000$$$::"...So this could end up bad for the both of us?"[lr]::
44792::$$$message_0397_0031_0001$$$::"Right. I can't take your magical circuit and unfortunately me giving you my magical cirucit is also incorrect.[lr]::
44793::$$$message_0397_0031_0002$$$::And that's why..."[lr]::
44794::$$$message_0397_0031_0003$$$::"That's why...?"[lr]::
44795::$$$message_0397_0031_0004$$$::"I'm going to transplant my Magic Crest into you."::
44796::$$$message_0397_0032_0000$$$::Magic Crest.[lr]::
44797::$$$message_0397_0032_0001$$$::It records the secrets and hidden arts of a mage's family; it's their history.[lr]::
44798::$$$message_0397_0032_0002$$$::If Magic Circuits are the blood and bones of a mage, then one could say that the crest is their muscle.::
44799::$$$message_0397_0033_0000$$$::A Magic Crest is magecraft taking form.[lr]::
44800::$$$message_0397_0033_0001$$$::Through the life work of the mage leading the family in that generation, what was supposed to be formless is then given form. It is the proof of a mage's existence.[lr]::
44801::$$$message_0397_0033_0002$$$::Tohsaka having inherited her family's crest, she gets to enact the magecraft that this generation's family head created.::
44802::$$$message_0397_0034_0000$$$::"...Wait, but that means[line2]"[lr]::
44803::$$$message_0397_0034_0001$$$::"It's much easier to give a Magic Crest to someone. Unlike Magic Circuits, crests are meant to be given to others.[lr]::
44804::$$$message_0397_0034_0002$$$::...Well, while it doesn't define me as much as my Magic Circuits do, the crest is still created by the Tohsaka family, so it should suffice for our purpose."::
44805::$$$message_0397_0035_0000$$$::"...Are you sure?"[lr]::
44806::$$$message_0397_0035_0001$$$::"I'm sure. Well, the magecraft that was crystalized into the crest would probably be rendered useless, but at least I can turn that into a receiver for magical energy.[lr]::
44807::$$$message_0397_0035_0002$$$::Or are you talking about the success rate? Like is it possible to transplant the Magic Crest to someone outside my family's bloodline?"::
44808::$$$message_0397_0036_0000$$$::"...Yeah, that part worries me too, but..."[lr]::
44809::$$$message_0397_0036_0001$$$::"Don't worry, leave it to me. I will back you up, and we'll get that Holy Grail with you, me and Saber, the three of us.[lr]::
44810::$$$message_0397_0036_0002$$$::That's right, we already made up our minds. I will overcome my biggest failure with everything I've got."::
44811::$$$message_0397_0037_0000$$$::She asserts confidently with a bright smile.[lr]::
44812::$$$message_0397_0037_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
44813::$$$message_0397_0037_0002$$$::There is nothing else that needs to be said.::
44814::$$$message_0397_0038_0000$$$::Removing her Magic Crest.[lr]::
44815::$$$message_0397_0038_0001$$$::That's the same as delaying her family's ultimate wish with her own hands.[lr]::
44816::$$$message_0397_0038_0002$$$::...I've seen that so many times.[lr]::
44817::$$$message_0397_0038_0003$$$::The fact that she could overcome that truth with a simple smile and with such determination is her strength, and I've seen it so many times.::
44818::$$$message_0397_0039_0000$$$::"Wh-what? Why are you smiling like that?[lr]::
44819::$$$message_0397_0039_0001$$$::I-is something weird on my face?"[lr]::
44820::$$$message_0397_0039_0002$$$::"What? ...Ummm. Right, it's the same when we went to the church. I don't know how to put this, but it's hard to know what to like about you."[lr]::
44821::$$$message_0397_0039_0003$$$::"...That's rude.[lr]::
44822::$$$message_0397_0039_0004$$$::That reminds me, was my face weird at that time?"::
44823::$$$message_0397_0040_0000$$$::The fated night when I summoned Saber.[lr]::
44824::$$$message_0397_0040_0001$$$::Tohsaka looked seriously worried about me, someone who is just her enemy, when I got sick at the church. I'll never forget how much that expression saved me. [lr]::
44825::$$$message_0397_0040_0002$$$::I can't say too much about others, but Tohsaka was a really nice person, probably nicer than anyone I've ever met.::
44826::$$$message_0397_0041_0000$$$::"Well yeah, it was weird.[lr]::
44827::$$$message_0397_0041_0001$$$::At the time I only thought of you as a goodie two-shoes at school, so I didn't think you would make a face like that."[lr]::
44828::$$$message_0397_0041_0002$$$::"...Whatever. That's right, I'm just a woman who's cold as the iceberg. Sorry I couldn't make it more obvious before."::
44829::$$$message_0397_0042_0000$$$::Yes, but I have been saved by her.[lr]::
44830::$$$message_0397_0042_0001$$$::She's kind yet realistic, and has the heart of steel who's willing to discard her weakness at a moment's notice.[lr]::
44831::$$$message_0397_0042_0002$$$::...She hides her hesitation and troubles in her heart, and always shows the elegant side of her to everyone, treading forward on her own path with grace.::
44832::$$$message_0397_0043_0000$$$::"And? It's fine what you think about me, but why are you still staring at me?"[lr]::
44833::$$$message_0397_0043_0001$$$::"What? Oh, I suppose I was captivated by you. I know it might be too late, but maybe I fell for you because of your charm."[lr]::
44834::$$$message_0397_0043_0002$$$::"...!"::
44835::$$$message_0397_0044_0000$$$::Then I can't lose.[lr]::
44836::$$$message_0397_0044_0001$$$::She's willing to transplant her Magical Crest to me without hesitation and regret. Then I must repay her kindness with my own trust.::

44838::$$$message_0397_0045_0001$$$::Tohsaka is readying herself.[lr]::
44839::$$$message_0397_0045_0002$$$::I'm glad. It seems she's prepared and has noticed my resolve.::
44840::$$$message_0397_0046_0000$$$::"Yeah, I understand. We're short on time so we probably shouldn't waste time on small talk, right?[lr]::
44841::$$$message_0397_0046_0001$$$::C'mon, let's start the transplant. Specifically, what am I supposed to do, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
44842::$$$message_0397_0046_0002$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
44843::$$$message_0397_0046_0003$$$::Her mouth is wide open.[lr]::

44862::$$$message_0397_0050_0003$$$::But Tohsaka is having this strange troubled look on her face.::
44863::$$$message_0397_0051_0000$$$::"What's going on? Is it something you can't tell me? I'm prepared for anything so it won't faze me unless it's something really surprising."[lr]::
44864::$$$message_0397_0051_0001$$$::This is what I meant by trust.[lr]::
44865::$$$message_0397_0051_0002$$$::Tohsaka nods her head.[lr]::
44866::$$$message_0397_0051_0003$$$::"...Fine, it is hard for me to say this but...[lr]::
44867::$$$message_0397_0051_0004$$$::Just take off your clothes."[lr]::
44868::$$$message_0397_0051_0005$$$::With nervousness in her tone, she issued me a command I'm not used to.::
44869::$$$message_0397_0051_0006$$$::"..."[lr]::
44870::$$$message_0397_0051_0007$$$::Let's assess the situation.[lr]::
44871::$$$message_0397_0051_0008$$$::The lights are off.[lr]::
44872::$$$message_0397_0051_0009$$$::Tohsaka is sitting on the bed with her head down, clearly nervous.[lr]::
44873::$$$message_0397_0051_0010$$$::...Why am I only realizing this now? Tohsaka's soft-looking body, and her supple legs dangling above the floor are all making her look very seductive.[lr]::
44874::$$$message_0397_0051_0011$$$::And...[lr]::
44875::$$$message_0397_0051_0012$$$::She's asking me to take off my clothes.::
44876::$$$message_0397_0052_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
44877::$$$message_0397_0052_0001$$$::"Hey you there! Don't get the wrong idea! I'm just telling you to take off your clothes![lr]::
44878::$$$message_0397_0052_0002$$$::I-I'm also going to take my clothes off so it's fair!"[lr]::
44879::$$$message_0397_0052_0003$$$::I took my weird fantasy back after she yelled at me.::
44880::$$$message_0397_0053_0000$$$::"...Wait? Are you...taking...your clothes off, too?"[lr]::
44881::$$$message_0397_0053_0001$$$::I don't know how else to interpret what she said other than taking it as exactly what it is.::
44882::$$$message_0397_0054_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
44883::$$$message_0397_0054_0001$$$::"I-I told you not to twist my words! I asked you to take off your clothes so we can sense each other's body warmth directly! Nothing else![lr]::
44884::$$$message_0397_0054_0002$$$::Listen! We must highly synchronize our senses in order to perform the Magic Crest transplant. In order for that to happen, we have to get rid of as much interference as possible."[lr]::
44885::$$$message_0397_0054_0003$$$::"O-Oh, ok. That makes sense."::
44886::$$$message_0397_0055_0000$$$::Of course.[lr]::
44887::$$$message_0397_0055_0001$$$::I'm not sure what transplanting a Magic Crest actually looks like, but from the sound of it, it could be similar to a medical transplant. I guess you wouldn't operate on a patient when they're fully clothed.[lr]::
44888::$$$message_0397_0055_0002$$$::"You could've told me that from the beginning... Ummm, I just need to take the top off, right?"[lr]::
44889::$$$message_0397_0055_0003$$$::"O-of course! I will throw the heater at you if you dare take your pants off!"::
44890::$$$message_0397_0056_0000$$$::It's scary thinking of what she might actually do.[lr]::
44891::$$$message_0397_0056_0001$$$::Taking off my top... I have had her take care of my injuries a few times already, but it still feels a little embarrassing.[lr]::
44892::$$$message_0397_0056_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
44893::$$$message_0397_0056_0003$$$::I can hear Tohsaka taking a deep breath in the dark.::
44894::$$$message_0397_0057_0000$$$::"...Ok, now for the next step. Shirou, turn around."[lr]::
44895::$$$message_0397_0057_0001$$$::"Right, I forgot you have to take your clothes off, too."[lr]::
44896::$$$message_0397_0057_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
44897::$$$message_0397_0057_0003$$$::No answer.[lr]::
44898::$$$message_0397_0057_0004$$$::Taking her silence as affirmation, I quietly turn around.::
44899::$$$message_0397_0058_0000$$$::"..."::
44900::$$$message_0397_0059_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
44901::$$$message_0397_0059_0001$$$::As I turn my back towards her, I take a deep breath to calm myself.[lr]::
44902::$$$message_0397_0059_0002$$$::I'm going to receive her Magic Crest, and create a path between us.[lr]::
44903::$$$message_0397_0059_0003$$$::Her magical energy will pass through it, and allow me to activate the Reality Marble in order to defeat that Servant.[lr]::
44904::$$$message_0397_0059_0004$$$::This is simply a process in this long and dangerous fight.[lr]::
44905::$$$message_0397_0059_0005$$$::I should be able to suppress unnecessary thoughts by just reaffirming that fact to myself.::
44906::$$$message_0397_0060_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
44907::$$$message_0397_0060_0001$$$::"...You can turn around now, Shirou."[lr]::
44908::$$$message_0397_0060_0002$$$::My heart skips a beat.[lr]::
44909::$$$message_0397_0060_0003$$$::I turn around slowly to face Tohsaka.::
44910::$$$message_0397_0061_0000$$$::"...Ummm?"[lr]::
44911::$$$message_0397_0061_0001$$$::I let out a sound.[lr]::
44912::$$$message_0397_0061_0002$$$::It might seem rude, but I'm troubled by what I'm seeing.::
44913::$$$message_0397_0062_0000$$$::"Say Tohsaka... Why are you taking off your clothes so reluctantly?"[lr]::
44914::$$$message_0397_0062_0001$$$::Tohsaka has taken off some clothes.[lr]::
44915::$$$message_0397_0062_0002$$$::But, from the way she removed them I don't feel any resolve in her.::
44916::$$$message_0397_0063_0000$$$::"Wh-what!? Do you have a problem with me!?"[lr]::
44917::$$$message_0397_0063_0001$$$::"...Not really a problem per se, but it's not symmetrical. Basically, I took off everything I was wearing on top but you've only taken off that much clothing. The ratio just doesn't match. It's gotta be relatively the same between us."[lr]::
44918::$$$message_0397_0063_0002$$$::"...F-Fine, I'll take my leggings off as well... Geez, he's more of a maniac than I thought."::
44919::$$$message_0397_0064_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
44920::$$$message_0397_0064_0001$$$::...Well.[lr]::
44921::$$$message_0397_0064_0002$$$::I shouldn't press further on what we are talking about.::
44922::$$$message_0397_0065_0000$$$::"It's fine. You're the one performing the ritual, so as long as the ritual can be successful I won't complain."[lr]::
44923::$$$message_0397_0065_0001$$$::"...I mean, the ritual will be more difficult when we have more clothes on... But, it's such a waste if I just show you everything now..."[lr]::
44924::$$$message_0397_0065_0002$$$::Tohsaka is murmuring to herself.[lr]::
44925::$$$message_0397_0065_0003$$$::Fortunately, it's taking everything in me to keep calm, so I don't have any energy left to argue with Tohsaka.::
44926::$$$message_0397_0066_0000$$$::"...Fine then, Shirou, turn around again."[lr]::
44927::$$$message_0397_0066_0001$$$::She whispers to me, and I turn around immediately.[lr]::
44928::$$$message_0397_0066_0002$$$::This time, the sound of Tohsaka's clothes rustling lasts a little longer than before.[lr]::
44929::$$$message_0397_0066_0003$$$::Once again, I remind myself that this is a serious ritual.[lr]::
44930::$$$message_0397_0066_0004$$$::Even if Tohsaka is in her most exposed and defenseless form, my becoming franctic will ruin this whole thing.::
44931::$$$message_0397_0067_0000$$$::"...H-how about now, Shirou?"[lr]::
44932::$$$message_0397_0067_0001$$$::Tohsaka's voice trembles.[lr]::
44933::$$$message_0397_0067_0002$$$::I slowly look over Tohsaka's body.::
44934::$$$message_0397_0068_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
44935::$$$message_0397_0068_0001$$$::I can faintly see the soft outline of her body under the dim lamp light.[lr]::
44936::$$$message_0397_0068_0002$$$::Her shoulder, neck, and collarbone form the most beautiful silhouette.::
44937::$$$message_0397_0069_0000$$$::"...Well? Are you happy now?"[lr]::
44938::$$$message_0397_0069_0001$$$::I'm relieved that even when she looks so beautiful, she's still the same snappy Tohsaka. [lr]::
44939::$$$message_0397_0069_0002$$$::I try to relax my expression, as I feel that I may have unknowingly broken into a smile. ::
44940::$$$message_0397_0070_0000$$$::"Very. This is actually making it a bit difficult for me."[lr]::
44941::$$$message_0397_0070_0001$$$::I cover my face with my hands, and take a very deep breath.[lr]::
44942::$$$message_0397_0070_0002$$$::If I don't at least hide my face, which is probably red as an apple right now, I'll lose my composure.::
44943::$$$message_0397_0071_0000$$$::"Hmmm. Since I get to you see like that, let's call it even.[lr]::
44944::$$$message_0397_0071_0001$$$::...Shirou, come here."::
44945::$$$message_0397_0072_0000$$$::Tohsaka makes a gesture, beckoning me to join her at the bed.[lr]::
44946::$$$message_0397_0072_0001$$$::...We sit facing each other on the bed. The bed bounces, reacting to our weight.::
44947::$$$message_0397_0073_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
44948::$$$message_0397_0073_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
44949::$$$message_0397_0073_0002$$$::Without saying a word, we both take in a deep breath.[lr]::
44950::$$$message_0397_0073_0003$$$::...Tohsaka is going to start the Magic Crest transplant ritual.[lr]::
44951::$$$message_0397_0073_0004$$$::I force myself to calm down before this intimate encounter.[lr]::
44952::$$$message_0397_0073_0005$$$::My consciousness is getting clearer as I focus my mind.::
44953::$$$message_0397_0074_0000$$$::"I'm going to start now. Shirou, hold this against your chest."[lr]::
44954::$$$message_0397_0074_0001$$$::She reaches out her left hand with the Magic Crest.[lr]::
44955::$$$message_0397_0074_0002$$$::...As I began receiving magical energy, the pattern on the upper area of my exposed arm faintly started to shine.::
44956::$$$message_0397_0075_0000$$$::"After we sync up, I will transplant my Magic Crest into your Magic Circuit.[lr]::
44957::$$$message_0397_0075_0001$$$::Ultimately, the Magic Crest is part of someone else's body... having it transplanted into you is the same as getting a foreign object put inside you, so it's possible that your body may show signs of rejection."[lr]::
44958::$$$message_0397_0075_0002$$$::"I understand. I'm used to rough stuff like that."::
44959::$$$message_0397_0076_0000$$$::This is no different from how I was training to use my Magic Circuit.[lr]::
44960::$$$message_0397_0076_0001$$$::Activating a foreign nerve system while learning to control it... Not sure if it will be the same experience as with a Magic Crest.::
44961::$$$message_0397_0077_0000$$$::"It seems you are. I heard you have the tendency of exhausting your body."[lr]::
44962::$$$message_0397_0077_0001$$$::Maybe because this reminded her of my unusual training, but Tohsaka lets out a small giggle.[lr]::
44963::$$$message_0397_0077_0002$$$::However...::
44964::$$$message_0397_0078_0000$$$::"That's that. If you do anything weird right now I'll kill you."[lr]::
44965::$$$message_0397_0078_0001$$$::She glares at me with narrowed eyes.[lr]::
44966::$$$message_0397_0078_0002$$$::"...What do you mean by weird?"[lr]::
44967::$$$message_0397_0078_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
44968::$$$message_0397_0078_0004$$$::She ignored me.::
44969::$$$message_0397_0079_0000$$$::I shorten the distance between us to the point that our shoulders are practically bumping together.[lr]::
44970::$$$message_0397_0079_0001$$$::It looks like I'm embracing Tohsaka's left hand.[lr]::
44971::$$$message_0397_0079_0002$$$::I can feel Tohsaka's breath on my neck.[lr]::
44972::$$$message_0397_0079_0003$$$::But then I realize she isn't just breathing...::
44973::$$$message_0397_0080_0000$$$::"Gib dem wandernden Vogel das Trinkwasser,[r]::

44977::$$$message_0397_0081_0000$$$::Her breath trembles as she utters the incantation.[lr]::
44978::$$$message_0397_0081_0001$$$::I can sense that magical energy is filling her body through her left hand.[lr]::
44979::$$$message_0397_0081_0002$$$::Her delicate fingers are placed on my chest. Through them I can feel her pulse together with my own heartbeat.::

44985::$$$message_0397_0083_0001$$$::...My heartbeat is syncing with the pulse of her magical energy. She's adjusting her pulse to match mine, while I maintain a steady rhythm.[lr]::
44986::$$$message_0397_0083_0002$$$::...I focus my mind and keep it in a serene state like I do during my own training. This is the only thing I can do, since I've never experienced synchronization and don't have a feel for it.::
44987::$$$message_0397_0084_0000$$$::"Nimm an, ohne anderer Meinung zu sein, ohne zu fallen.[lr]::
44988::$$$message_0397_0084_0001$$$::Es nimmt an, ohne zu fürchten, ohne zu zweifeln.[lr]::

44992::$$$message_0397_0085_0001$$$::My sense of smell is weakening, and my sense of taste is fading.[lr]::
44993::$$$message_0397_0085_0002$$$::My body's senses [flicker time=300 count=1]are getting distorted. I can't tell clearly if I'm sitting down or if I'm standing up.[lr]::
44994::$$$message_0397_0085_0003$$$::In contrast, I can feel the warmth of Tohsaka's skin intimately. [flicker time=300 count=2]My own heartbeat and Tohsaka's pulse, I can't tell which is which anymore.::
44995::$$$message_0397_0086_0000$$$::A phantom pain as if someone was having a hold over my heart.[lr]::
44996::$$$message_0397_0086_0001$$$::A phantom experience, as if I am gripping someone's heart.[lr]::
44997::$$$message_0397_0086_0002$$$::I move around my fingers trying to identify this feeling I have in my palm.[lr]::

44999::$$$message_0397_0087_0000$$$::My hearing still works, I heard a sound just now.[lr]::
45000::$$$message_0397_0087_0001$$$::Wait, my senses are mixed up. I can't tell if that was my body I touched or if that was Tohsaka's voice I heard.::

45002::$$$message_0397_0088_0001$$$::...the breaths that escape from her mouth are pained.[lr]::
45003::$$$message_0397_0088_0002$$$::Even while knowing that it isn't my own breath that I'm hearing, I can't help but listen to it.::
45004::$$$message_0397_0089_0000$$$::"Hey, try to pull yourself together, Shirou."::
45005::$$$message_0397_0090_0000$$$::A voice from inside of me just yelled at me.[lr]::
45006::$$$message_0397_0090_0001$$$::I try to ask what's happening and what's going to happen.::
45007::$$$message_0397_0091_0000$$$::"We're only at the first phase of synchronization. That's why our senses have swapped and are all mixed up.[lr]::
45008::$$$message_0397_0091_0001$$$::The real challenge is coming. If you don't focus you will be pulled about by our shared senses[line2]"::
45009::$$$message_0397_0092_0000$$$::That was as much as I could hear before I suddenly lost myself.[lr]::
45010::$$$message_0397_0092_0001$$$::It feels like my body has turned to paper and is rapidly being folded up.[lr]::
45011::$$$message_0397_0092_0002$$$::Slowly, the paper that is my body is being carefully tucked away. But since time has stopped for the surrounding world, from the outside it probably seems like all of this is happening at the speed of light.[lr]::
45012::$$$message_0397_0092_0003$$$::There's no limit to this repeated process of accumulation and contraction.[lr]::
45013::$$$message_0397_0092_0004$$$::Even though there is a limit to how many times you can fold up a two-dimensional surface no matter how much area it has, my body keeps folding inward.[lr]::
45014::$$$message_0397_0092_0005$$$::My vision turns blue, while it was red before I was folded up.::
45015::$$$message_0397_0093_0000$$$::...I'm floating.[lr]::
45016::$$$message_0397_0093_0001$$$::I'm falling yet floating at the same time, and the world is passing me by at a rapid speed.[lr]::
45017::$$$message_0397_0093_0002$$$::I try to reach out my hand to familiarize myself in this world where acceleration and termination exist at the same time.::
45018::$$$message_0397_0094_0000$$$::...Ah.[lr]::
45019::$$$message_0397_0094_0001$$$::I just realized that my arms were already folded away so there's nothing for me to reach out with.[lr]::
45020::$$$message_0397_0094_0002$$$::Now that's an issue. I already severed things that I've deemed unnecessary to this place, but I didn't think I would lose my arms and legs. If this keeps on then I will lose my sense of self.[lr]::
45021::$$$message_0397_0094_0003$$$::That's why the first thing I need to do is not to confirm the world, but to assume my own form.::
45022::$$$message_0397_0095_0000$$$::I squeeze my hands.[lr]::
45023::$$$message_0397_0095_0001$$$::Although temporary, I have certainly achieved a sense of self.[lr]::
45024::$$$message_0397_0095_0002$$$::I am floating in a blue celestial sphere. There's no up or down, no sky or earth.[lr]::
45025::$$$message_0397_0095_0003$$$::It's quiet. I'm not talking about sound, but my current finite state of serenity.::
45026::$$$message_0397_0096_0000$$$::Time is flowing on the outside.[lr]::
45027::$$$message_0397_0096_0001$$$::Blue sea fills the outside.[lr]::
45028::$$$message_0397_0096_0002$$$::There's nothing within the celestial sphere.[lr]::
45029::$$$message_0397_0096_0003$$$::That means, this celestial sphere is the sky to the blue sea.::
45030::$$$message_0397_0097_0000$$$::The Egg of the World.[lr]::
45031::$$$message_0397_0097_0001$$$::Is the celestial sphere being covered in shells?[lr]::
45032::$$$message_0397_0097_0002$$$::Or is the celestial sphere flipped inside out?[lr]::
45033::$$$message_0397_0097_0003$$$::Does the void give birth to all? Or does the void seep out from all?[lr]::
45034::$$$message_0397_0097_0004$$$::The celestial sphere continues to rotate while inverted.::
45035::$$$message_0397_0098_0000$$$::Here, time is eternal.[lr]::
45036::$$$message_0397_0098_0001$$$::The formless gains form over the course of an eternity.[lr]::

45141::$$$message_0397_0125_0001$$$::"...Of course it was successful. It was a resounding success. It was so successful there's not even a slight trace of side effects. It was so perfectly done even Kirei would praise me with that devious face of his."[lr]::

45159::$$$message_0397_0130_0001$$$::"Yes, this is the Magic Crest I transplanted. It already became part of your circuit and any traces of its original magecraft is nowhere to be seen."[lr]::
45160::$$$message_0397_0130_0002$$$::"I see... Well, this sure is something. I thought it would hurt but it doesn't really hurt at all. If anything my arm only feels a bit more heavy than before."::
45161::$$$message_0397_0131_0000$$$::"You'll get used to it soon. Since its sole purpose is to connect our magical energies together, it shouldn't have any effect on the human body.[lr]::

45183::$$$message_0397_0138_0001$$$::...Maybe that's what Tohsaka was talking about?[lr]::
45184::$$$message_0397_0138_0002$$$::An illusion I saw for a brief moment.[lr]::
45185::$$$message_0397_0138_0003$$$::In the state where we were sharing our senses due to the synchronization, it's possible that we could see imagery from each other's mind.[lr]::
45186::$$$message_0397_0138_0004$$$::It wouldn't be much different than when I saw Saber's dream or Heroic Spirit Emiya's dream.::
45187::$$$message_0397_0139_0000$$$::It all makes sense now.[lr]::
45188::$$$message_0397_0139_0001$$$::If this is the case, then the only thing I saw that she would care about is that scene taking place at a school yard during sunset, something that I haven't seen in my other dreams.::

45215::$$$message_0397_0149_0001$$$::She grabs the back of my neck and throws me out of her room.::
45216::$$$message_0397_0150_0000$$$::"Mr. Emiya? Just so you know, a girl has a lot to do to get ready, so would you return to your room now?"[lr]::
45217::$$$message_0397_0150_0001$$$::With that evil grin of hers... Tohsaka slams the door.[lr]::
45218::$$$message_0397_0150_0002$$$::...Thrown out into the hallway looking like this, I blankly look up at the door.::
45219::$$$message_0397_0151_0000$$$::"...Don't be ridiculous. Guys have lots of stuff to do too."[lr]::
45220::$$$message_0397_0151_0001$$$::I hold my dizzy head and get up.[lr]::
45221::$$$message_0397_0151_0002$$$::I thought of saying something back to Tohsaka on the other side of the door, but I decide not to.[lr]::
45222::$$$message_0397_0151_0003$$$::I wasn't able to ask Tohsaka what that scene I saw meant to her.::
45223::$$$message_0397_0152_0000$$$::"...Well. If she's that mad about it, it must have some special meaning to her."[lr]::
45224::$$$message_0397_0152_0001$$$::Muttering silly stuff like that to myself, I go back to my room.::
45225::$$$message_0397_0153_0000$$$::It was probably just an excuse for Tohsaka to kick me out, but it's true that there's no time.[lr]::
45226::$$$message_0397_0153_0001$$$::The date has already changed.[lr]::
45227::$$$message_0397_0153_0002$$$::There's probably less than an hour left before we head to the temple.::
45228::$$$message_0397_0154_0000$$$::"Hm... Yeah, this is..."[lr]::
45229::$$$message_0397_0154_0001$$$::I close my eyes and feel the magical energy from Tohsaka pouring into me.[lr]::
45230::$$$message_0397_0154_0002$$$::Tohsaka isn't consciously supplying me, yet it's filling my body up.::
45231::$$$message_0397_0155_0000$$$::If my maximum magical energy capacity is twenty or thirty units, then she always has 500 units of magical energy.[lr]::
45232::$$$message_0397_0155_0001$$$::...I'm sure it would take years to stock up, but her maximum capacity might reach 1000 units if someone supplied her.::
45233::$$$message_0397_0156_0000$$$::"...I'm surprised. She really is amazing."[lr]::
45234::$$$message_0397_0156_0001$$$::That reconfirms it. Or rather, I finally realize it now.[lr]::
45235::$$$message_0397_0156_0002$$$::Well, she's depleted now, and mages usually only keep about eighty percent of their magical energy, so Tohsaka's magical energy is about 400 units right now.::
45236::$$$message_0397_0157_0000$$$::But, that's still a massive amount of magical energy.[lr]::
45237::$$$message_0397_0157_0001$$$::I use about two units of magical energy to use Strengthening magecraft once.[lr]::
45238::$$$message_0397_0157_0002$$$::To use Projection once, I use about five units of magical energy on average.[lr]::
45239::$$$message_0397_0157_0003$$$::Using that example, the Projection that I can use only six times at most could be used thirty or even sixty times with the help of Tohsaka.::
45240::$$$message_0397_0158_0000$$$::"...Well, a cheap vehicle will overheat no matter how much fuel there is..."[lr]::
45241::$$$message_0397_0158_0001$$$::But it has still tremendously increased my power.[lr]::
45242::$$$message_0397_0158_0002$$$::I might even have a chance of winning against that King of Heroes like this.::
45243::$$$message_0397_0159_0000$$$::All that's left is...[lr]::
45244::$$$message_0397_0159_0001$$$::"...There's one more hour. I should rest my body until then."[lr]::
45245::$$$message_0397_0159_0002$$$::I'll rest my body and regain my mental and physical strength for the final battle at Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
45246::$$$message_0397_0159_0003$$$::...Everything is set.[lr]::
45247::$$$message_0397_0159_0004$$$::I'll face the last night with a fully prepared body for Tohsaka's sake too since she gave me her Magic Crest and opened up to me...Jyk"
