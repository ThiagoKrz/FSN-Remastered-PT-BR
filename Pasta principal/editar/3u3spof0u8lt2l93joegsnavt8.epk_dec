46117::$$$message_0409_0000_0000$$$::"Ungh!"[lr]::
46118::$$$message_0409_0000_0001$$$::I desperately parry the constant flurry of fists.[lr]::
46119::$$$message_0409_0000_0002$$$::Kuzuki's fists are live "snakes." Even if I barely dodge them, they change their course of direction to come bite me the moment I avoid them.[lr]::
46120::$$$message_0409_0000_0003$$$::That's how Saber got seriously injured.[lr]::
46121::$$$message_0409_0000_0004$$$::Saber was grazed by Kuzuki's "snake" because she had the reflexes to dodge it.::
46122::$$$message_0409_0001_0000$$$::But, I don't have such reflexes.[lr]::
46123::$$$message_0409_0001_0001$$$::I can't dodge them, and first of all, I can't even see his fists.[lr]::
46124::$$$message_0409_0001_0002$$$::I can't see them, so it's impossible to even dodge them.::
46125::$$$message_0409_0002_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
46126::$$$message_0409_0002_0001$$$::My shoulder. Kuzuki's fist grazes my left collarbone.[lr]::
46127::$$$message_0409_0002_0002$$$::"Haah, guh...!"[lr]::
46128::$$$message_0409_0002_0003$$$::It's like a sledgehammer. It feels as if my left shoulder is shattered and I almost drop my dagger.::
46129::$$$message_0409_0003_0000$$$::"...Ungh."[lr]::
46130::$$$message_0409_0003_0001$$$::I stop and bear it, repelling the repeated fists aiming towards my face with the dagger in my right hand.::
46131::$$$message_0409_0004_0000$$$::"Agh, guh...!"[lr]::
46132::$$$message_0409_0004_0001$$$::I desperately retreat. [lr]::
46133::$$$message_0409_0004_0002$$$::I retreat without regard for my appearance, while Kuzuki closes in, without revealing how he advanced.::
46134::$$$message_0409_0005_0000$$$::"Haah..."[lr]::
46135::$$$message_0409_0005_0001$$$::    I shiver at his stance.[lr]::
46136::$$$message_0409_0005_0002$$$::I won't be able to withstand the next attack.[lr]::
46137::$$$message_0409_0005_0003$$$::It's absurd that I was able to parry all the attacks until now.[lr]::
46138::$$$message_0409_0005_0004$$$::It doesn't feel real. My misunderstanding of being able to manage with just defense and being a decoy until Tohsaka defeats Caster shattered from the first blow.::
46139::$$$message_0409_0006_0000$$$::Souichirou Kuzuki took our previous battle in account.[lr]::
46140::$$$message_0409_0006_0001$$$::Before, I was able to fend off Kuzuki, who attacked Tohsaka.[lr]::
46141::$$$message_0409_0006_0002$$$::So I thought I'd be able to block his attacks if I Projected Archer's twin swords.[lr]::
46142::$$$message_0409_0006_0003$$$::   But.[lr]::
46143::$$$message_0409_0006_0004$$$::On the other hand, that means I can't do anything without Archer's swords.::
46144::$$$message_0409_0007_0000$$$::Kuzuki took that into consideration.[lr]::
46145::$$$message_0409_0007_0001$$$::This time, the first thing that Kuzuki did was try to take away my twin swords.::
46146::$$$message_0409_0008_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
46147::$$$message_0409_0008_0001$$$::My right dagger shatters.[lr]::
46148::$$$message_0409_0008_0002$$$::   His fist, Strengthened by Caster's magecraft, destroys my sword with just a few blows.::
46149::$$$message_0409_0009_0000$$$::"Trace, on...!"[lr]::
46150::$$$message_0409_0009_0001$$$::I immediately replace the dagger.[lr]::
46151::$$$message_0409_0009_0002$$$::I can't expect high quality from a forced Projection and quickly made swords.[lr]::
46152::$$$message_0409_0009_0003$$$::As a result, the twin swords that had received several attacks lose their accuracy.::
46153::$$$message_0409_0010_0000$$$::"Guh... Haah, haah, haah...!"[lr]::
46154::$$$message_0409_0010_0001$$$::I can't control my breathing.[lr]::
46155::$$$message_0409_0010_0002$$$::I frantically block Kuzuki's snake with my twin swords.[lr]::
46156::$$$message_0409_0010_0003$$$::My body just follows the twin swords. My limbs that copy Archer's movements have far exceeded the limits of my body.::
46157::$$$message_0409_0011_0000$$$::And then there's this headache.[lr]::
46158::$$$message_0409_0011_0001$$$::My body erodes every time my twin swords are destroyed and I Project new ones.[lr]::
46159::$$$message_0409_0011_0002$$$::It's different from using up magical energy.[lr]::
46160::$$$message_0409_0011_0003$$$::It feels like I lose one of the few Magic Circuits I have every time I make a new sword.::
46161::$$$message_0409_0012_0000$$$::I'm almost out.[lr]::
46162::$$$message_0409_0012_0001$$$::I might be able to make two more.[lr]::
46163::$$$message_0409_0012_0002$$$::It's over when my magical energy runs out.[lr]::
46164::$$$message_0409_0012_0003$$$::But, first of all...[lr]::
46165::$$$message_0409_0012_0004$$$::Would I even be able to make two more...?::
46166::$$$message_0409_0013_0000$$$::"Huh... uh?"[lr]::
46167::$$$message_0409_0013_0001$$$::I'm in the air.[lr]::
46168::$$$message_0409_0013_0002$$$::Kuzuki's right fist. The fist that he hadn't been using was thrust like a spear.::
46169::$$$message_0409_0014_0000$$$::I parried the blow that tried to pierce through my chest and rib cage with my twin swords.[lr]::
46170::$$$message_0409_0014_0001$$$::In an instant, my twin swords are destroyed, and it seems like I was flung away from the impact.[lr]::
46171::$$$message_0409_0014_0002$$$::I feel something hard against my back.[lr]::
46172::$$$message_0409_0014_0003$$$::...I must've been flung about five meters.::
46173::$$$message_0409_0015_0000$$$::"Haah... Guh."[lr]::
46174::$$$message_0409_0015_0001$$$::I try to resume my breathing and realize I can't breathe.[lr]::
46175::$$$message_0409_0015_0002$$$::The penetrating impact is numbing my heart.[lr]::
46176::$$$message_0409_0015_0003$$$::I can't breathe, and I can't even move my limbs.[lr]::
46177::$$$message_0409_0015_0004$$$::Just for a few seconds.[lr]::
46178::$$$message_0409_0015_0005$$$::During that gap of my heart resuming to work,::
46179::$$$message_0409_0016_0000$$$::"Hnng..."[lr]::
46180::$$$message_0409_0016_0001$$$::the devil approaches.[lr]::
46181::$$$message_0409_0016_0002$$$::This is it.[lr]::
46182::$$$message_0409_0016_0003$$$::This man would finish me off if I dropped my guard for only a second.[lr]::
46183::$$$message_0409_0016_0004$$$::With me like this, it would be more than enough time to kill me six times.::
46184::$$$message_0409_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46185::$$$message_0409_0017_0001$$$::I glare at my enemy.[lr]::
46186::$$$message_0409_0017_0002$$$::Even if my limbs don't move, there are still things I can do.[lr]::
46187::$$$message_0409_0017_0003$$$::I'm not one who wields swords to start with.[lr]::
46188::$$$message_0409_0017_0004$$$::My weapon that I fight with has always been magecraft.[lr]::
46189::$$$message_0409_0017_0005$$$::Then... It's not over yet.[lr]::
46190::$$$message_0409_0017_0006$$$::My role is to hold Kuzuki down. I can't give up without fulfilling my role...!::
46191::$$$message_0409_0018_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
46192::$$$message_0409_0018_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46193::$$$message_0409_0018_0002$$$::That hitting sound didn't come from in front of me.[lr]::
46194::$$$message_0409_0018_0003$$$::The structure of the sword that I was imagining disappears.[lr]::
46195::$$$message_0409_0018_0004$$$::Kuzuki, who was approaching to twist off my neck, stops.[lr]::
46196::$$$message_0409_0018_0005$$$::That abnormality was behind Kuzuki.[lr]::
46197::$$$message_0409_0018_0006$$$::It happened to Caster, with the altar behind her.::
46198::$$$message_0409_0019_0000$$$::Tohsaka is also at an advantage.[lr]::
46199::$$$message_0409_0019_0001$$$::No, the burden is greater than mine since she clearly understands the difference in their powers.::
46200::$$$message_0409_0020_0000$$$::"[line3][aero][line3]"[lr]::
46201::$$$message_0409_0020_0001$$$::Caster points her fingers towards her, full of composure.[lr]::
46202::$$$message_0409_0020_0002$$$::The magecraft is "Aero."[lr]::
46203::$$$message_0409_0020_0003$$$::Caster has no need for incantations.[lr]::
46204::$$$message_0409_0020_0004$$$::To the witch that lived in the age of gods, she does not need a process to connect herself with the world.[lr]::
46205::$$$message_0409_0020_0005$$$::Caster is always surrounded by the divine mysteries that make the world go round.[lr]::
46206::$$$message_0409_0020_0006$$$::For her, magecraft is just something she commands.[lr]::
46207::$$$message_0409_0020_0007$$$::It is just like ordering a guard dog to attack.::
46208::$$$message_0409_0021_0000$$$::"...Acht (Eighth)...!"[lr]::
46209::$$$message_0409_0021_0001$$$::She counters that with her treasured jewels.[lr]::
46210::$$$message_0409_0021_0002$$$::She does not have the time to cast a spell, and she cannot match Caster's magecraft with simple spells.::
46211::$$$message_0409_0022_0000$$$::Their skills as a mage are as far apart as heaven and earth.[lr]::
46212::$$$message_0409_0022_0001$$$::To bridge that gap, she can only bring out the thing that she has been accumulating for a long time.[lr]::
46213::$$$message_0409_0022_0002$$$::The crystallization of magical energy that she has stored since she was born as the daughter of a mage.[lr]::
46214::$$$message_0409_0022_0003$$$::She faces the challenge, preparing to use the remaining nine out of ten irreplaceable jewels.::
46215::$$$message_0409_0023_0000$$$::"Heheh, how brave of you. I didn't think you had such a trump card, young lady."[lr]::
46216::$$$message_0409_0023_0001$$$::Caster keeps her smile, even though her magecraft is being nullified by pure magical energy.::
46217::$$$message_0409_0024_0000$$$::Caster, who can exercise magecraft almost infinitely,[lr]::
46218::$$$message_0409_0024_0001$$$::and the girl who opposes her using jewels as amplifiers.[lr]::
46219::$$$message_0409_0024_0002$$$::That difference is obvious.[lr]::
46220::$$$message_0409_0024_0003$$$::I do not know how many jewels she has, but it should be around ten or twenty.[lr]::
46221::$$$message_0409_0024_0004$$$::There is no way she can defeat Caster with that amount.::
46222::$$$message_0409_0025_0000$$$::"...Sieben (Seventh)...!"[lr]::
46223::$$$message_0409_0025_0001$$$::She neutralizes the electric charge with the seventh jewel.[lr]::
46224::$$$message_0409_0025_0002$$$::There are six jewels left.[lr]::
46225::$$$message_0409_0025_0003$$$::With six more spells from Caster, her trump card will run out.::
46226::$$$message_0409_0026_0000$$$::"Oh, you dodge them well. So brave. You wouldn't run out of jewels if you were just protecting yourself."[lr]::
46227::$$$message_0409_0026_0001$$$::Without reacting to the giggling voice, she readies the jewel between her fingers in preparation for the next bullet.[lr]::
46228::$$$message_0409_0026_0002$$$::...Just as Caster says, her jewels would not shatter if she were just protecting herself.[lr]::
46229::$$$message_0409_0026_0003$$$::Each jewel should be able to block Caster's spell about three times.::
46230::$$$message_0409_0027_0000$$$::...But, she couldn't do that.[lr]::
46231::$$$message_0409_0027_0001$$$::Caster's magecraft covers the sanctuary once it is activated.[lr]::
46232::$$$message_0409_0027_0002$$$::Kuzuki should be protected by Caster, but he is an exception.[lr]::
46233::$$$message_0409_0027_0003$$$::If she doesn't counter Caster's magecraft before it is activated, then Shirou Emiya, who is keeping Souichirou Kuzuki busy, will burn and die.::
46234::$$$message_0409_0028_0000$$$::"...Ungh."[lr]::
46235::$$$message_0409_0028_0001$$$::Therefore, it is meaningless if she protects only herself.[lr]::
46236::$$$message_0409_0028_0002$$$::She can't let him die like that, and the premise of this strategy is that he stops Kuzuki.::
46237::$$$message_0409_0029_0000$$$::"Oh, you still plan to keep on protecting him? That is quite some conviction, but I wonder how long that will last. The result is clear if all you do is defend, young lady."[lr]::
46238::$$$message_0409_0029_0001$$$::Caster's fingers move.::
46239::$$$message_0409_0030_0000$$$:: "...Sechs (Sixth) Ein Flu√ü, ein Halt (Winter River)...!"[lr]::
46240::$$$message_0409_0030_0001$$$::In response to that, she makes the first move.[lr]::
46241::$$$message_0409_0030_0002$$$::Her jewels will run out and she will be killed if she keeps on defending.[lr]::
46242::$$$message_0409_0030_0003$$$::Caster's magecraft and her jewels.[lr]::
46243::$$$message_0409_0030_0004$$$::If the magical energy contained is the same, then it means she can beat Caster if she makes the first move...!::
46244::$$$message_0409_0031_0000$$$::"[line3][keraino][line3]"[lr]::
46245::$$$message_0409_0031_0001$$$::But, she cannot surpass Caster's spells.[lr]::
46246::$$$message_0409_0031_0002$$$::If Rin Tohsaka is the fastest without using spells and can establish magecraft just by releasing jewels,[lr]::
46247::$$$message_0409_0031_0003$$$::Caster is also the fastest as she can create divine mysteries with just one phrase.[lr]::
46248::$$$message_0409_0031_0004$$$::There is no first move in their battle.[lr]::
46249::$$$message_0409_0031_0005$$$::This is just a clash of power against power.[lr]::
46250::$$$message_0409_0031_0006$$$::The first one to lose from the clash and run out of magical energy loses.[lr]::
46251::$$$message_0409_0031_0007$$$::Then...::
46252::$$$message_0409_0032_0000$$$::"F√ºnf (Fifth), Drei (Third), Vier (Fourth)...![lr]::
46253::$$$message_0409_0032_0001$$$::Der Rieseund (Finale) brennt (Sword of Flames) das (Synergy) ein Ende...!"[lr]::
46254::$$$message_0409_0032_0002$$$::She just needs to force her way through.[lr]::
46255::$$$message_0409_0032_0003$$$::She uses her jewels one after another and breaks through Caster's magical energy...![r]::
46256::$$$message_0409_0032_0004$$$::There are three jewels released.[lr]::
46257::$$$message_0409_0032_0005$$$::Additionally, she uses her treasured fourth jewel to add a synergistic effect.[lr]::
46258::$$$message_0409_0032_0006$$$::That magecraft is beyond her limits.[lr]::
46259::$$$message_0409_0032_0007$$$::"You cannot use magecraft surpassing your own tolerance."[r]::
46260::$$$message_0409_0032_0008$$$::She herself who told him that is breaking the rule to unleash this attack.[lr]::
46261::$$$message_0409_0032_0009$$$::The attack would destroy not only the sanctuary but the entire church had Caster not defended against it...::
46262::$$$message_0409_0033_0000$$$::But the witch in purple blocks it like it is nothing.[lr]::
46263::$$$message_0409_0033_0001$$$::   No, it wasn't just that...[lr]::
46264::$$$message_0409_0033_0002$$$::Caster had swallowed all of her magical energy into her robe.::
46265::$$$message_0409_0034_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46266::$$$message_0409_0034_0001$$$::Tohsaka stands there in astonishment.[lr]::
46267::$$$message_0409_0034_0002$$$::...Behind her, she can hear the sound of his defeat.[lr]::
46268::$$$message_0409_0034_0003$$$::The sound of breaking swords and his body slamming against the wall.::
46269::$$$message_0409_0035_0000$$$::The match is about to be settled.[lr]::
46270::$$$message_0409_0035_0001$$$::There is nothing she can do, and her body sways.[lr]::
46271::$$$message_0409_0035_0002$$$::She staggers forward as if defeated by inescapable despair.::
46272::$$$message_0409_0036_0000$$$::"Oh, this is it? You still have more jewels, right? Why don't you try until you run out without giving up?"[lr]::
46273::$$$message_0409_0036_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46274::$$$message_0409_0036_0002$$$::She has no energy to answer.[lr]::
46275::$$$message_0409_0036_0003$$$::...Regardless of how many jewels she has left, this was the best she could do.[lr]::
46276::$$$message_0409_0036_0004$$$::If that didn't work, not even a hundred jewels would be enough to hurt Caster with her magecraft...::
46277::$$$message_0409_0037_0000$$$::"I see. It seems you finally realized that you're no match for me no matter what you do. But it was fun, young lady. It has been a while since I competed with magecraft.[lr]::
46278::$$$message_0409_0037_0001$$$::Yes, I shall give you value just because of that."[lr]::
46279::$$$message_0409_0037_0002$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
46280::$$$message_0409_0037_0003$$$::She stops herself from falling forward, suppresses her nausea with her hand, and keeps glaring at Caster.::
46281::$$$message_0409_0038_0000$$$::"Is it vexing? But this is reality. Actually, you should be proud.[lr]::
46282::$$$message_0409_0038_0001$$$::Even though I did play with you, you forced me to compete in magecraft."[lr]::
46283::$$$message_0409_0038_0002$$$::Then Caster points at her.[lr]::
46284::$$$message_0409_0038_0003$$$::As if to pronounce her death sentence.[lr]::
46285::$$$message_0409_0038_0004$$$::"Disappear. It is a matter of time until that boy is defeated by my Master.[lr]::
46286::$$$message_0409_0038_0005$$$::Before that...let us finish as well."::
46287::$$$message_0409_0038_0006$$$::Caster slowly murmurs her death.[lr]::
46288::$$$message_0409_0038_0007$$$::   That opening.[lr]::
46289::$$$message_0409_0038_0008$$$::She had been waiting for that judgment.[lr]::
46290::$$$message_0409_0038_0009$$$::"Stark (Second)[line3]Gro√ü (Strengthen) zwei"[lr]::
46291::$$$message_0409_0038_0010$$$::She only needs one phrase to release the spell.[lr]::
46292::$$$message_0409_0038_0011$$$::She hangs her head and smiles as she murmurs.::
46293::$$$message_0409_0039_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
46294::$$$message_0409_0039_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
46295::$$$message_0409_0040_0000$$$::I doubt my own eyes for a moment.[lr]::
46296::$$$message_0409_0040_0001$$$::Tohsaka and Caster.[lr]::
46297::$$$message_0409_0040_0002$$$::Their battle of magecraft ended with Tohsaka's defeat.[lr]::
46298::$$$message_0409_0040_0003$$$::Tohsaka slowly staggered forward as if asking for Caster's forgiveness, and Caster released magecraft to finish her off.::
46299::$$$message_0409_0041_0000$$$::    That... moment...[lr]::
46300::$$$message_0409_0041_0001$$$::Tohsaka counters the released magecraft.::
46301::$$$message_0409_0042_0000$$$::That's fine.[lr]::
46302::$$$message_0409_0042_0001$$$::That's not surprising.[lr]::
46303::$$$message_0409_0042_0002$$$::The problem is after that... Tohsaka punches Caster with a fired up stance...!::
46304::$$$message_0409_0043_0000$$$::Tohsaka throws herself into the hellfire.[lr]::
46305::$$$message_0409_0043_0001$$$::She counters the released magecraft and, using it as a distraction, she jumps onto Caster.::
46306::$$$message_0409_0044_0000$$$::"...Guh!?"[lr]::
46307::$$$message_0409_0044_0001$$$::Caster's surprise is that of a mage.[lr]::
46308::$$$message_0409_0044_0002$$$::She could not have predicted that the mage that lost in magecraft would come punching at her.[lr]::
46309::$$$message_0409_0044_0003$$$::I didn't expect it either, so it must be like blasphemy for Caster, who is an excellent mage.::
46310::$$$message_0409_0045_0000$$$::But, that isn't just a useless struggle.[lr]::
46311::$$$message_0409_0045_0001$$$::Tohsaka closes in and lands a one-inch punch, a Chinese martial arts move, on Caster's chest.::
46312::$$$message_0409_0046_0000$$$::"Guh... Ugh...!?"[lr]::
46313::$$$message_0409_0046_0001$$$::A shattering sound.[lr]::
46314::$$$message_0409_0046_0002$$$::Tohsaka must've Strengthened her fist like Kuzuki, as her blow easily breaks through Caster's defense.::
46315::$$$message_0409_0047_0000$$$::"...You're a mage and you're fighting bare-handed...!?"[lr]::
46316::$$$message_0409_0047_0001$$$::"Tough luck...! Self-defense is a required subject for mages nowadays...!"::
46317::$$$message_0409_0048_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
46318::$$$message_0409_0048_0001$$$::I'm honestly fascinated by her coordination.[lr]::
46319::$$$message_0409_0048_0002$$$::Tohsaka drops to the ground right after the one-inch punch.[lr]::
46320::$$$message_0409_0048_0003$$$::Putting both hands on the ground, she crouches down to Caster's knees.[lr]::
46321::$$$message_0409_0048_0004$$$::To Caster, who has no hand-to-hand combat knowledge, it must look like Tohsaka disappeared.[lr]::
46322::$$$message_0409_0048_0005$$$::Then, she executes a foot sweep.[lr]::
46323::$$$message_0409_0048_0006$$$::Her kick using her entire body is explosive, as if trying to kick off Caster's legs.::
46324::$$$message_0409_0049_0000$$$::"Ah...!?"[lr]::
46325::$$$message_0409_0049_0001$$$::Caster's feet are swept beneath her and lands on her back.::
46326::$$$message_0409_0050_0000$$$::But it doesn't stop.[lr]::
46327::$$$message_0409_0050_0001$$$::After the sweep, Tohsaka stands up with her back turned to Caster, uses the turning momentum to jab Caster with an elbow...[lr]::
46328::$$$message_0409_0050_0002$$$::"Fly...!"[lr]::
46329::$$$message_0409_0050_0003$$$::Tohsaka stops her turning and throws a straight punch at Caster, putting her weight into it...!::
46330::$$$message_0409_0051_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
46331::$$$message_0409_0051_0001$$$::Caster's body is blown away.[lr]::
46332::$$$message_0409_0051_0002$$$::Taking Tohsaka's straight punch directly, Caster is slammed into the wall like me.::
46333::$$$message_0409_0052_0000$$$::"Ah... Agh!"[lr]::
46334::$$$message_0409_0052_0001$$$::Leaning against the wall, Caster pants dizzily.::
46335::$$$message_0409_0053_0000$$$::"Got you...!"[lr]::
46336::$$$message_0409_0053_0001$$$::There is distance between them.[lr]::
46337::$$$message_0409_0053_0002$$$::Tohsaka kicks the ground to cover the few meters between them.[lr]::
46338::$$$message_0409_0053_0003$$$::The match is settled.[lr]::
46339::$$$message_0409_0053_0004$$$::Caster cannot move, and her wound seems fatal.::
46340::$$$message_0409_0054_0000$$$::The battle only lasted for a few seconds.[lr]::
46341::$$$message_0409_0054_0001$$$::The match is settled within a five second interval after I was smashed into the wall when confronting Kuzuki.::
46342::$$$message_0409_0055_0000$$$::Caster has no energy left to fight back.[lr]::
46343::$$$message_0409_0055_0001$$$::Tohsaka closes in on Caster with Saber-like speed and delivers the finishing blow.::
46344::$$$message_0409_0056_0000$$$::Strengthening for just a few seconds using magecraft.[lr]::
46345::$$$message_0409_0056_0001$$$::Tohsaka intended to fight Caster close combat from the start.[lr]::
46346::$$$message_0409_0056_0002$$$::Caster only saw Tohsaka as a mage.[lr]::
46347::$$$message_0409_0056_0003$$$::She acted like she was at a disadvantage so that she could use that opening to achieve her one-time surprise attack.::
46348::$$$message_0409_0057_0000$$$::And the plan worked.[lr]::
46349::$$$message_0409_0057_0001$$$::Caster was deceived by Tohsaka and completely lost.[lr]::
46350::$$$message_0409_0057_0002$$$::Tohsaka has won this battle.[lr]::
46351::$$$message_0409_0057_0003$$$::   Yes.[lr]::
46352::$$$message_0409_0057_0004$$$::"...No. That's far enough, Tohsaka."[lr]::
46353::$$$message_0409_0057_0005$$$::If not for this man's monstrous athleticism.::
46354::$$$message_0409_0058_0000$$$::If Tohsaka running to Caster was like a hurricane, then his speed is like a storm caused by the devil.::
46355::$$$message_0409_0059_0000$$$::"No... way..."[lr]::
46356::$$$message_0409_0059_0001$$$::Tohsaka stops.[lr]::
46357::$$$message_0409_0059_0002$$$::In front of Caster leaning against the wall is Souichirou Kuzuki, who was just in front of me until now.::
46358::$$$message_0409_0060_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
46359::$$$message_0409_0060_0001$$$::Tohsaka moves.[lr]::
46360::$$$message_0409_0060_0002$$$::The instant Tohsaka feels death and immediately shields her face while jumping back,::
46361::$$$message_0409_0060_0003$$$::Kuzuki's right fist that blew me away strikes Tohsaka's face.::
46362::$$$message_0409_0061_0000$$$::"Ungh...!"[lr]::
46363::$$$message_0409_0061_0001$$$::Tohsaka guards her face with both hands and jumped back, but she's sent flying.[lr]::
46364::$$$message_0409_0061_0002$$$::Tohsaka is smashed into the wall opposite from me with her arms dangling down, as if they are broken.::
46365::$$$message_0409_0062_0000$$$::"You missed your chance of victory. It's because of your inexperience that you weren't able to kill her after four strikes."[lr]::
46366::$$$message_0409_0062_0001$$$::He says calmly.[lr]::
46367::$$$message_0409_0062_0002$$$::...But, that's not Tohsaka's fault.[lr]::
46368::$$$message_0409_0062_0003$$$::The reason she lost her chance is because of me.[lr]::
46369::$$$message_0409_0062_0004$$$::If I had stopped Kuzuki, Tohsaka would have defeated Caster.::
46370::$$$message_0409_0063_0000$$$::   This is my responsibility.[lr]::
46371::$$$message_0409_0063_0001$$$::Our once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was lost because of my inexperience and Souichirou Kuzuki's superior hand-to-hand combat skills.::
