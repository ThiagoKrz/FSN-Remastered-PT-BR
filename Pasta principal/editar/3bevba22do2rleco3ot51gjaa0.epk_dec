51383::$$$message_0443_0000_0000$$$::It's bedtime.[lr]::
51384::$$$message_0443_0000_0001$$$::I don't know what happened to Saber, but the lights have gone out in that room. The sound of activity from it has gone silent.[lr]::
51385::$$$message_0443_0000_0002$$$::I've heard it gets noisy when there's three girls together, and it seems that is true even when they're quiet like Saber and Sakura are.::
51386::$$$message_0443_0001_0000$$$::"...Wait, never mind. It was mainly Fuji-nee's laughter."[lr]::
51387::$$$message_0443_0001_0001$$$::Though it was still pretty noisy.[lr]::
51388::$$$message_0443_0001_0002$$$::It isn't good for my mental health to have girls the same age as me being rowdy under the same roof.::
51389::$$$message_0443_0002_0000$$$::"...Damn it. My sleepiness went away thinking about them."[lr]::
51390::$$$message_0443_0002_0001$$$::Like Saber's troubled expression,[lr]::
51391::$$$message_0443_0002_0002$$$::if Sakura and Saber are getting along,[lr]::
51392::$$$message_0443_0002_0003$$$::or what Fuji-nee is even thinking.::
51393::$$$message_0443_0003_0000$$$::The more that I think, the more my head starts hurting. If it's like this, it might've been better if Saber slept in the room next to mine. ::

51395::$$$message_0443_0004_0001$$$::It's 11 PM.[lr]::
51396::$$$message_0443_0004_0002$$$::The lights are out in the house, and there's not a single sound outside.[lr]::
51397::$$$message_0443_0004_0003$$$::My hand goes to the door to slide it open and tiptoe by so Fuji-nee doesn't hear anything.::
51398::$$$message_0443_0005_0000$$$::I go out to the garden.[lr]::
51399::$$$message_0443_0005_0001$$$::The moon is shining bright, while the cutting breeze is cold.[lr]::
51400::$$$message_0443_0005_0002$$$::In the winter night, the world was silent, as if frozen.::
51401::$$$message_0443_0006_0000$$$::The shed has gone still.[lr]::
51402::$$$message_0443_0006_0001$$$::The place where I got cornered by Lancer yesterday,[lr]::
51403::$$$message_0443_0006_0002$$$::and the place where Saber appeared.[lr]::
51404::$$$message_0443_0006_0003$$$::The entrance is still open, and the darkness inside feels uninviting.::
51405::$$$message_0443_0007_0000$$$::I go inside.[lr]::
51406::$$$message_0443_0007_0001$$$::Closing the door behind me to shut out the cold air, I turn on an old stove heater.::
51407::$$$message_0443_0008_0000$$$::"...Shoot over 200 arrows, huh?"[lr]::
51408::$$$message_0443_0008_0001$$$::The teaching of archery focuses on accuracy, piercing strength, and persistence.[lr]::
51409::$$$message_0443_0008_0002$$$::Accuracy is how well one can hit the target.[lr]::
51410::$$$message_0443_0008_0003$$$::Piercing strength is the power to pierce the target.[lr]::
51411::$$$message_0443_0008_0004$$$::And lastly, persistence is how long one can maintain the accuracy and piercing strength.::
51412::$$$message_0443_0009_0000$$$::...I think I read it somewhere in an archery manual.[lr]::
51413::$$$message_0443_0009_0001$$$::Once one aims to be a shooter, after they learn the true meaning of kyudo, they continue that forever.[lr]::
51414::$$$message_0443_0009_0002$$$::So they say to shoot over 200 arrows... Or something.::
51415::$$$message_0443_0010_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I don't know what I should do as a Master, so I should at least train my magecraft."[lr]::
51416::$$$message_0443_0010_0001$$$::I sit down inside the shed and take a deep breath.::
51417::$$$message_0443_0011_0000$$$::"Haah... Haah..."[lr]::
51418::$$$message_0443_0011_0001$$$::...I control my breathing and begin my regular training.[lr]::
51419::$$$message_0443_0011_0002$$$::My mind imagines the same thing that it always does.[lr]::
51420::$$$message_0443_0011_0003$$$::An image of a sword that comes to mind.::
51421::$$$message_0443_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
51422::$$$message_0443_0012_0001$$$::I ignore that and clear my mind even more.[lr]::
51423::$$$message_0443_0012_0002$$$::Once I've let magical energy flow throughout my entire body, I practice Strengthening like usual.[lr]::
51424::$$$message_0443_0012_0003$$$::When I was attacked by Lancer last night, I succeeded in Strengthening for the first time in a few years.[lr]::
51425::$$$message_0443_0012_0004$$$::I need to repeat it so that I don't forget the sensation, or else it would be a waste.::
51426::$$$message_0443_0013_0000$$$::"...Trace, on."[lr]::
51427::$$$message_0443_0013_0001$$$::I narrow my eyes and breathe out deeply.::
51428::$$$message_0443_0014_0000$$$::    That's all for now.[lr]::
51429::$$$message_0443_0014_0001$$$::I forget all about the Holy Grail War, Saber, and Tohsaka once I immerse myself into the process.[lr]::
51430::$$$message_0443_0014_0002$$$::Clear all thoughts and hesitation from my mind.::
51431::$$$message_0443_0015_0000$$$::But, during the process...[lr]::
51432::$$$message_0443_0015_0001$$$::the thought that Tohsaka, who's a mage like me, might be doing the same kind of training never leaves my head.::&
