33612::$$$message_0268_0000_0000$$$::It's 7 PM.[lr]::
33613::$$$message_0268_0000_0001$$$::Tohsaka came right on time.::
33614::$$$message_0268_0001_0000$$$::"Sorry to keep you waiting. It took a while since I was getting the necessary things.[lr]::
33615::$$$message_0268_0001_0001$$$::How's your preparation?"[lr]::
33616::$$$message_0268_0001_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33617::$$$message_0268_0001_0003$$$::I hand her the practice sword bag.[lr]::
33618::$$$message_0268_0001_0004$$$::There's a bokutou, a wooden sword, inside.[lr]::
33619::$$$message_0268_0001_0005$$$::This is all the preparation I can do.::
33620::$$$message_0268_0002_0000$$$::"...Well, I guess that makes sense. Anyway, we have Saber for hand-to-hand combat. You might just end up watching."::
33621::$$$message_0268_0003_0000$$$::"That's true. As long as Saber is here, all I have to do is back her up."[lr]::
33622::$$$message_0268_0003_0001$$$::...Well, I find it hard to think of a situation where I actually need to watch her back.::
33623::$$$message_0268_0004_0000$$$::"Rin. Why is Archer not here?"[lr]::
33624::$$$message_0268_0004_0001$$$::Then...[lr]::
33625::$$$message_0268_0004_0002$$$::With a sharp look, Saber asks a question.::
33626::$$$message_0268_0005_0000$$$::"Huh...? Tohsaka, you didn't bring Archer?"[lr]::
33627::$$$message_0268_0005_0001$$$::"...Yes, I left him home. We're doing a surprise attack tonight, so we don't need him if we have Saber, right? To be honest, I don't want him anywhere near Caster."::
33628::$$$message_0268_0006_0000$$$::Tohsaka starts walking.[lr]::
33629::$$$message_0268_0006_0001$$$::...I don't know what she's thinking, but that means that we won't have the help of Archer this time.::
33630::$$$message_0268_0007_0000$$$::...Time passes.[lr]::
33631::$$$message_0268_0007_0001$$$::We have to cross this intersection to get to Ryudou Temple from school.::
33632::$$$message_0268_0008_0000$$$::It's already taken an hour to set up our territory.[lr]::
33633::$$$message_0268_0008_0001$$$::The simple Bounded Field set up by Tohsaka...[lr]::
33634::$$$message_0268_0008_0002$$$::"We're screwed if we're seen, but the soundproofing is perfect.[lr]::
33635::$$$message_0268_0008_0003$$$::Nobody would even notice if a missile exploded here."[lr]::
33636::$$$message_0268_0008_0004$$$::   According to Tohsaka.::
33637::$$$message_0268_0009_0000$$$::The surrounding area is too quiet.[lr]::
33638::$$$message_0268_0009_0001$$$::It might also be because Tohsaka's field is working, but everything feels too lifeless.[lr]::
33639::$$$message_0268_0009_0002$$$::   It's already been seven days since the Holy Grail War started.[lr]::
33640::$$$message_0268_0009_0003$$$::It seems like the town's spirit is being slowly stripped away without anyone noticing.::
33641::$$$message_0268_0010_0000$$$::"...He's here. Hide, Emiya."[lr]::
33642::$$$message_0268_0010_0001$$$::"Hnn..."[lr]::
33643::$$$message_0268_0010_0002$$$::I move to the wall.[lr]::
33644::$$$message_0268_0010_0003$$$::...I can't even hear the footsteps.[lr]::
33645::$$$message_0268_0010_0004$$$::There's a figure beneath the streetlight.::
33646::$$$message_0268_0011_0000$$$::A tall and lean physique...[lr]::
33647::$$$message_0268_0011_0001$$$::That familiar figure is definitely Souichirou Kuzuki.[lr]::
33648::$$$message_0268_0011_0002$$$::Mr. Kuzuki passes by in front of us with his usual orderly footsteps.::
33649::$$$message_0268_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33650::$$$message_0268_0012_0001$$$::He's too defenseless.[lr]::
33651::$$$message_0268_0012_0002$$$::I'm assaulted with the feeling that Mr. Kuzuki might be innocent.::
33652::$$$message_0268_0013_0000$$$::"...Hey, Tohsaka. Don't you think Mr. Kuzuki might be innocent after all?"[lr]::
33653::$$$message_0268_0013_0001$$$::"...Well, we'll find out soon."[lr]::
33654::$$$message_0268_0013_0002$$$::Tohsaka seems to be half in doubt as well.[lr]::
33655::$$$message_0268_0013_0003$$$::It seems like she's still carrying on with her plan, as she points her index finger towards Mr. Kuzuki.::
33656::$$$message_0268_0014_0000$$$::    Gandr.[lr]::
33657::$$$message_0268_0014_0001$$$::It is a curse that lowers the target's physical ability, considered to be a simple magecraft.[lr]::
33658::$$$message_0268_0014_0002$$$::Tohsaka's is more like a gunshot instead of a Gandr, but I'm sure she'll lower the intensity this time.::
33659::$$$message_0268_0015_0000$$$::"Are you ready, Emiya?"[lr]::
33660::$$$message_0268_0015_0001$$$::She whispers.::
33661::$$$message_0268_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
33662::$$$message_0268_0016_0001$$$::There's still time.[lr]::
33663::$$$message_0268_0016_0002$$$::The possibility that Souichirou Kuzuki is innocent.[lr]::
33664::$$$message_0268_0016_0003$$$::Isn't there another way other than Gandr to check if he's a Master or not...?[lr]::
