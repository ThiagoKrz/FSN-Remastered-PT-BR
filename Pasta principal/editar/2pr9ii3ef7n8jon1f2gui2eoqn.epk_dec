21360::$$$message_0193_0000_0000$$$::Being unarmed at the most crucial moment...[lr]::
21361::$$$message_0193_0000_0001$$$::This is Tiger Dojo, a place to help people like you.::
21362::$$$message_0193_0000_0002$$$::Well, the common wisdom is that victory or defeat are decided before the battle even begins.[lr]::
21363::$$$message_0193_0000_0003$$$::And what does that mean, Disciple Number One!?::
21364::$$$message_0193_0000_0004$$$::Ummm...you shouldn't start a battle until you have a weapon or plan?::
21365::$$$message_0193_0000_0005$$$::Very good! The enemy is a Servant who cheats by bringing in the strongest stuff with his power of ridiculous wealth. So you should prepare at least one weapon that might help you turn things around.::
21366::$$$message_0193_0000_0006$$$::Hmmm, then are you saying you should restart from the night before to prepare a new weapon?[lr]::
21367::$$$message_0193_0000_0007$$$::What can he possibly do in such a short time?::
21368::$$$message_0193_0000_0008$$$::Well, it IS possible.[lr]::
21369::$$$message_0193_0000_0009$$$::Saber originally had three Noble Phantasms. You should be able to do something if you prepare that last one.::
21370::$$$message_0193_0000_0010$$$::Oh. So you just have to give it back.::
21371::$$$message_0193_0000_0011$$$::Exactly. Like they say, render unto Caesar...[lr]::
21372::$$$message_0193_0000_0012$$$::It might be a shame to lose it, but I guess you have to return things to their owners.::
21373::$$$message_0193_0000_0013$$$::Oh. I guess you give good advice sometimes, Taiga.[lr]::
21374::$$$message_0193_0000_0014$$$::I guess you're a teacher, even if you're not a very good one.::
21375::$$$message_0193_0000_0015$$$::Ah hahaha! Praise me! Praise me more!::
21376::$$$message_0193_0000_0016$$$::Yeah, yeah. Then while Taiga's in a good mood, I have an exciting announcement to make.::
21377::$$$message_0193_0000_0017$$$::Um, so this segment has been running as a little side thing to the main story, but this is the final episode!::
21378::$$$message_0193_0000_0018$$$::Next time, a new series, "Tiger Dojo Part Two: Taiga, One Hundred Million Yen in Debt" will begin!::
21379::$$$message_0193_0000_0019$$$::We're going to move this place to my castle and update the background, still pics, music, and game console!::
21380::$$$message_0193_0000_0020$$$::The production budget will double and it'll be so elaborate you won't even think it's just a bonus side segment!::
21381::$$$message_0193_0000_0021$$$::Gahahaha! Lots of good news here![lr]::
21382::$$$message_0193_0000_0022$$$::I don't really get it, but I guess it's like computer graphics updating from [font italic=true]Wars[font italic=false] to [font italic=true]Machines[font italic=false] or something!::
21383::$$$message_0193_0000_0023$$$::Exactly! We'll finally be freed from this cheap art that looks like it was done as a hurried afterthought!::
21384::$$$message_0193_0000_0024$$$::Wonderful! Now that that's settled, let's get the heck out of this dojo!::
21385::$$$message_0193_0000_0025$$$::See you, everyone! We'll be waiting for you in the renewed Tiger Dojo!::
