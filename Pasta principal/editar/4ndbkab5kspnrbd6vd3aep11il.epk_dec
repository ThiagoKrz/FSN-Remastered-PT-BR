37090::$$$message_0314_0000_0000$$$::"...Mm."[lr]::
37091::$$$message_0314_0000_0001$$$::I rub my heavy eyelids and get up.[lr]::
37092::$$$message_0314_0000_0002$$$::It's 5:30 AM.[lr]::
37093::$$$message_0314_0000_0003$$$::I don't feel sleepy, so I guess I was able to sleep well despite everything.::
37094::$$$message_0314_0001_0000$$$::"Man... I guess I'm pretty simple."[lr]::
37095::$$$message_0314_0001_0001$$$::I grumble while getting out of bed and change into my uniform.::
37096::$$$message_0314_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
37097::$$$message_0314_0002_0001$$$::I can hear faint breathing if I listen carefully.[lr]::
37098::$$$message_0314_0002_0002$$$::Saber's presence is apparent even from the other side of the door.::
37099::$$$message_0314_0003_0000$$$::"Oh... Breakfast. I'll go make breakfast."[lr]::
37100::$$$message_0314_0003_0001$$$::That's good, good.[lr]::
37101::$$$message_0314_0003_0002$$$::I shake the intrusive thought out of my head and tiptoe out of my room.::
37102::$$$message_0314_0004_0000$$$::The breakfast table.[lr]::
37103::$$$message_0314_0004_0001$$$::My expectation that it would be a quiet breakfast considering what happened yesterday...::
37104::$$$message_0314_0005_0000$$$::"And what do you think that doctor said? He said, 'You have an exceptionally healthy body, so why don't you donate some blood while you're here? Hahaha'!?[lr]::
37105::$$$message_0314_0005_0001$$$::Hey, I'm a patient too! Ugh, I'm not going to that place ever again!"::
37106::$$$message_0314_0006_0000$$$::...is overturned by Fuji-nee, who is even more hyper today.[lr]::
37107::$$$message_0314_0006_0001$$$::If this were a horse race, this situation is both the dark horse...and also somehow the most likely winner.::
37108::$$$message_0314_0007_0000$$$::"Oh, I want more miso soup. Can you leave the onions out?"[lr]::
37109::$$$message_0314_0007_0001$$$::"All right. ...So, what happened after that? I heard that the students who fainted were taken to different hospitals, but did they all come to afterward?"::
37110::$$$message_0314_0008_0000$$$::"Yeah, it varies but they should have all recovered by yesterday.[lr]::
37111::$$$message_0314_0008_0001$$$::The ones on the fourth floor... The first years only seemed like they were sleeping, and the second years seem to have lost memory of the incident.[lr]::
37112::$$$message_0314_0008_0002$$$::The third years are, um... The ones on the second floor are better off than those on the first floor, but the ones on the first are..."::
37113::$$$message_0314_0009_0000$$$::Fuji-nee looks down as though it's difficult for her to talk about.[lr]::
37114::$$$message_0314_0009_0001$$$::...I feel bad.[lr]::
37115::$$$message_0314_0009_0002$$$::All last night Fuji-nee went to one hospital after another.[lr]::
37116::$$$message_0314_0009_0003$$$::The classrooms on the first floor... She just saw what kind of condition the 3-A and 3-B students were in.::
37117::$$$message_0314_0010_0000$$$::"Sorry, we can talk about something else. Anyway, school is happening like usual right?"[lr]::
37118::$$$message_0314_0010_0001$$$::"Yeah. But the third years will start coming voluntarily, and those that are not feeling well don't need to come to school. I think most of the third years won't come today."::
37119::$$$message_0314_0011_0000$$$::...I see.[lr]::
37120::$$$message_0314_0011_0001$$$::Then it'll be mainly first years and second years coming to school today...::
37121::$$$message_0314_0012_0000$$$::"Hey, Fuji-nee. Who's connected to Ryudou Temple at our school?"[lr]::
37122::$$$message_0314_0012_0001$$$::"Wouldn't it be Issei? He's the successor of the temple, right?"[lr]::
37123::$$$message_0314_0012_0002$$$::"Yeah. Never mind, forget what I just asked."[lr]::
37124::$$$message_0314_0012_0003$$$::"Hm?"::
37125::$$$message_0314_0013_0000$$$::I set down my bowl as I look up at the ceiling to think.[lr]::
37126::$$$message_0314_0013_0001$$$::The only person at our school that has to do with the temple is Issei.[lr]::
37127::$$$message_0314_0013_0002$$$::But it's too rash to assume so easily that he's a Master, and most importantly, I don't think he could be‚Ä¶::
37128::$$$message_0314_0014_0000$$$::"I'm heading out now. Take care while I'm gone, Saber."[lr]::
37129::$$$message_0314_0014_0001$$$::"You take care of yourself too, Shirou. Even if there is no longer a Bounded Field at school, you cannot let your guard down so long as Caster's Master is there... You only have one more Command Spell, so please be very careful."::
37130::$$$message_0314_0015_0000$$$::"I know. If I find Caster's Master, I'll come home and report to you first."[lr]::
37131::$$$message_0314_0015_0001$$$::"...Yes. I shall replenish my magical energy so that I can be at the ready."::
37132::$$$message_0314_0016_0000$$$::Saber sees me off as I leave the gate.[lr]::
37133::$$$message_0314_0016_0001$$$::Fuji-nee seems to have some things to take care of regarding the incident yesterday, so she finished her breakfast quickly and went to the hospital immediately.::
37134::$$$message_0314_0017_0000$$$::Everything at school doesn't look any different even after what happened.[lr]::
37135::$$$message_0314_0017_0001$$$::It's 7:30 AM, and the school gate is crowded with students.[lr]::
37136::$$$message_0314_0017_0002$$$::The students are talking about what happened yesterday and seem to be creating a fuss over it.::
37137::$$$message_0314_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
37138::$$$message_0314_0018_0001$$$::And...[lr]::
37139::$$$message_0314_0018_0002$$$::In the middle of it all, in front of the school gate...::
37140::$$$message_0314_0019_0000$$$::There stands Tohsaka waiting with her arms crossed.::
37141::$$$message_0314_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
37142::$$$message_0314_0020_0001$$$::...I have a bad feeling about this.[lr]::
37143::$$$message_0314_0020_0002$$$::I have a bad feeling, but I can't sneak past her when she's standing in the middle of the school gate.::
37144::$$$message_0314_0021_0000$$$::"Yo. Morning, Tohsaka. You're late today."[lr]::
37145::$$$message_0314_0021_0001$$$::I stop and greet her on the way to the school building.::
37146::$$$message_0314_0022_0000$$$::"I think Issei's suspicious."::
37147::$$$message_0314_0023_0000$$$::...Whoa.[lr]::
37148::$$$message_0314_0023_0001$$$::The first thing that came out of her mouth is straight to the point.::
37149::$$$message_0314_0024_0000$$$::"...What do you mean by suspicious?"[lr]::
37150::$$$message_0314_0024_0001$$$::"Caster's Master. Caster is at the temple, and Issei is coming to school from the temple. There's something going on."::
37151::$$$message_0314_0025_0000$$$::"No way? That could just be a coincidence."[lr]::
37152::$$$message_0314_0025_0001$$$::I try to defend Issei.::
37153::$$$message_0314_0026_0000$$$::"Of course not! Look, the mountain gate at the temple has been closed for these past few weeks![lr]::
37154::$$$message_0314_0026_0001$$$::No outsiders can come in, and Issei's practically the only person who leaves![lr]::
37155::$$$message_0314_0026_0002$$$::If he's not suspicious, then I don't know who is!"::
37156::$$$message_0314_0027_0000$$$::"...Hey now. You said nobody comes out, but don't monks usually stay at the temple?"[lr]::
37157::$$$message_0314_0027_0001$$$::"You idiot. How outdated is your information? Monks make a living by going around house to house collecting offerings. If they could stay at the temple and live off the coin offerings from visitors, I'd become a monk myself!"::
37158::$$$message_0314_0028_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
37159::$$$message_0314_0028_0001$$$::...Tohsaka is surprisingly serious.[lr]::
37160::$$$message_0314_0028_0002$$$::If Issei were here, I'm sure he'd be yelling at her for being an offering thief.::
37161::$$$message_0314_0029_0000$$$::I'm interested in what's going on at the temple, but that's not the problem.[lr]::
37162::$$$message_0314_0029_0001$$$::Right now, let's be mindful of our surroundings.[lr]::
37163::$$$message_0314_0029_0002$$$::We're at the school gate.[lr]::
37164::$$$message_0314_0029_0003$$$::We're surrounded by students on their way to school, and they're frozen hearing the school idol ranting like a madwoman.::
37165::$$$message_0314_0030_0000$$$::"What's with those eyes? What, are you defending Issei?[lr]::
37166::$$$message_0314_0030_0001$$$::Heh, fine. If you're going to ignore the obvious, I'll go and solve the situation myself!"[lr]::
37167::$$$message_0314_0030_0002$$$::Yet, the school's idol is the only that does not realize [font italic=true]this[font italic=false] situation.::
37168::$$$message_0314_0031_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka, come over here."[lr]::
37169::$$$message_0314_0031_0001$$$::"What, are you going to run away!?"[lr]::
37170::$$$message_0314_0031_0002$$$::"I'm not running. Just come this way."[lr]::
37171::$$$message_0314_0031_0003$$$::I pull Tohsaka's hand and start walking.::
37172::$$$message_0314_0032_0000$$$::"Hey... Hey, Emiya...!?"[lr]::
37173::$$$message_0314_0032_0001$$$::She can complain later.[lr]::
37174::$$$message_0314_0032_0002$$$::Let me just get out of here as soon as possible...::
37175::$$$message_0314_0033_0000$$$::The morning practice must be canceled due to yesterday's incident, because the archery range is empty.[lr]::
37176::$$$message_0314_0033_0001$$$::"...Phew."[lr]::
37177::$$$message_0314_0033_0002$$$::...I'm glad.[lr]::
37178::$$$message_0314_0033_0003$$$::We won't attract any attention here.[lr]::
37179::$$$message_0314_0033_0004$$$::So the remaining problem is...::
37180::$$$message_0314_0034_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
37181::$$$message_0314_0034_0001$$$::...Tohsaka, who's staring me down.::
37182::$$$message_0314_0035_0000$$$::"I know. I can tell what you want to say. I know, so don't make a face like that. I don't know what to do when you sulk like that."[lr]::
37183::$$$message_0314_0035_0001$$$::"I'm not sulking!"::
37184::$$$message_0314_0036_0000$$$::"Oof."[lr]::
37185::$$$message_0314_0036_0001$$$::I'm stunned by the immediate comeback.[lr]::
37186::$$$message_0314_0036_0002$$$::But, I have to deal with her calmly.[lr]::
37187::$$$message_0314_0036_0003$$$::Issei's life is on the line.[lr]::
37188::$$$message_0314_0036_0004$$$::Knowing Tohsaka, I bet she would do something crazy to test Issei.::
37189::$$$message_0314_0037_0000$$$::"Don't try to deceive me. Caster's base is the temple, and Issei meets the criteria for the Master here. Why are you ignoring that fact?"::
37190::$$$message_0314_0038_0000$$$::Tohsaka yells at me.[lr]::
37191::$$$message_0314_0038_0001$$$::...It may be true, but I don't think Issei is the Master for a different reason...::
37192::$$$message_0314_0039_0000$$$::"...What? Do you have any objection?"[lr]::
37193::$$$message_0314_0039_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
37194::$$$message_0314_0039_0002$$$::But if I gave some half-assed reason, I would most likely die before Issei.[lr]::
37195::$$$message_0314_0039_0003$$$::At the same time, I can't leave Tohsaka like this, so I have to convince her somehow...::
37196::$$$message_0314_0040_0000$$$::"...All right. You're saying Issei is suspicious no matter what, right?"::
37197::$$$message_0314_0041_0000$$$::"Right. You might not be able to tell, but Ryudou Temple is really strange right now.[lr]::
37198::$$$message_0314_0041_0001$$$::Caster's using it as her base, though even with that in mind, the deformity there is too massive. She's collecting way too much..."::
37199::$$$message_0314_0042_0000$$$::"Collecting way too much...? Are you talking about the magical energy being sucked up from the town?"[lr]::
37200::$$$message_0314_0042_0001$$$::"N-no, I'm not, that's not...that's a different thing altogether."[lr]::
37201::$$$message_0314_0042_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
37202::$$$message_0314_0042_0003$$$::...Nah. You're way more suspicious than Issei right now, Tohsaka.::
37203::$$$message_0314_0043_0000$$$::"...Anyway! That guy has way too many flags, all while so flippantly going to and from the temple there everyday.[lr]::
37204::$$$message_0314_0043_0001$$$::Yes, I always knew that I would have to give him a kick, so this is the perfect opportunity."::
37205::$$$message_0314_0044_0000$$$::Tohsaka is serious.[lr]::
37206::$$$message_0314_0044_0001$$$::I had always heard that they didn't get along, but I didn't know it was this bad.[lr]::
37207::$$$message_0314_0044_0002$$$::...Actually...[lr]::
37208::$$$message_0314_0044_0003$$$::What the heck did Issei do to earn this from her, anyway?[lr]::
37209::$$$message_0314_0044_0004$$$::I'm a bit curious about what can make Tohsaka dramatically violent... No, now's not the time for that.::
37210::$$$message_0314_0045_0000$$$::"....Yeah. I agree that Issei's position is suspicious."[lr]::
37211::$$$message_0314_0045_0001$$$::"Of course. You would be guilty too if you kept on defending him."::
37212::$$$message_0314_0046_0000$$$::"Yeah. So leave Issei's case to me. I'll make it clear whether he's a Master or not."[lr]::
37213::$$$message_0314_0046_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
37214::$$$message_0314_0046_0002$$$::Whoa.[lr]::
37215::$$$message_0314_0046_0003$$$::The look she gives me says she doesn't trust me [font italic=true]at all[font italic=false].::
37216::$$$message_0314_0047_0000$$$::"Trust me. I won't take it easy just because he's my friend, and I'm not gonna lie. First of all, you don't have anything to worry about. There's no way Issei would do something so evil."[lr]::
37217::$$$message_0314_0047_0001$$$::"..."::
37218::$$$message_0314_0048_0000$$$::The silent onslaught continues.[lr]::
37219::$$$message_0314_0048_0001$$$::I imagine Tohsaka is worried that I might do just that and go easy on him.[lr]::
37220::$$$message_0314_0048_0002$$$::Which is fair enough, so I'll just have to take this scrutiny.[lr]::
37221::$$$message_0314_0048_0003$$$::I can only get her to trust me.::
37222::$$$message_0314_0049_0000$$$::"...Fine. I'll leave Issei up to you."[lr]::
37223::$$$message_0314_0049_0001$$$::"...Tohsaka."[lr]::
37224::$$$message_0314_0049_0002$$$::I sigh with relief.::
37225::$$$message_0314_0050_0000$$$::"But how are you going to tell? Do you know how to tell Masters apart?"[lr]::
37226::$$$message_0314_0050_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
37227::$$$message_0314_0050_0002$$$::Tohsaka asks me the fundamental defect in this proposal.::
37228::$$$message_0314_0051_0000$$$::"Oh... Um."[lr]::
37229::$$$message_0314_0051_0001$$$::"...Oh. Don't tell me you were going to go up to him and ask, 'hey Issei, are you a Master?'[lr]::
37230::$$$message_0314_0051_0002$$$::Even if we're working together, I will put an end to it straightaway if you're going to do such a stupid thing."::
37231::$$$message_0314_0052_0000$$$::"...Ugh."[lr]::
37232::$$$message_0314_0052_0001$$$::She's mad.[lr]::
37233::$$$message_0314_0052_0002$$$::Seriously mad.::
37234::$$$message_0314_0053_0000$$$::"Hold on. It's okay, I have a way of finding out whether he's a Master or not without having to ask him. I'll make sure to find out today, so please don't do anything. I'll contact you once I figure it out."::
37235::$$$message_0314_0054_0000$$$::"...You'd better. In the name of our working relationship."[lr]::
37236::$$$message_0314_0054_0001$$$::She starts walking, making a gesture that obviously tells me she's not convinced.::
37237::$$$message_0314_0055_0000$$$::"Look, I trust you. But, don't do anything too stupid. If Issei is a Master, one wrong move could lead to death."[lr]::
37238::$$$message_0314_0055_0001$$$::Tohsaka says and heads back to the school building.::
37239::$$$message_0314_0056_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
37240::$$$message_0314_0056_0001$$$::Once I see her off...[lr]::
37241::$$$message_0314_0056_0002$$$::"...Huh? Could it be..."[lr]::
37242::$$$message_0314_0056_0003$$$::I belatedly realize that she was really just worried about me.:Ó≈Á
