60361::$$$message_0549_0000_0000$$$::I arrive at my house.[lr]::
60362::$$$message_0549_0000_0001$$$::It's well past 1:00 AM.::
60363::$$$message_0549_0001_0000$$$::"Guoh."[lr]::
60364::$$$message_0549_0001_0001$$$::A brief coughing fit makes me cover my mouth, and I notice a little blood on my hand.[lr]::
60365::$$$message_0549_0001_0002$$$::It still hurts where Assassin punched me, and my back stings where it hit the wall.[lr]::
60366::$$$message_0549_0001_0003$$$::I don't know what the internal damage is like, but my back is probably bruised.[lr]::
60367::$$$message_0549_0001_0004$$$::Before, I would heal from light injuries right away, but now they don't heal at all.::
60368::$$$message_0549_0002_0000$$$::"Oh, right. I'm back to normal."[lr]::
60369::$$$message_0549_0002_0001$$$::My pact with Saber let me heal from all injuries on my own.::
60370::$$$message_0549_0003_0000$$$::That's gone now.[lr]::
60371::$$$message_0549_0003_0001$$$::Even a small wound could prove fatal.::
60372::$$$message_0549_0004_0000$$$::"Senpai."[lr]::
60373::$$$message_0549_0004_0001$$$::Someone calls me.[lr]::
60374::$$$message_0549_0004_0002$$$::Sakura's standing in the hallway just past the front door.::
60375::$$$message_0549_0005_0000$$$::"...Sakura? What's wrong? It's the middle of the night. Did I wake you up?"::
60376::$$$message_0549_0006_0000$$$::"I'm up late because I couldn't fall sleep. I saw your shoes were gone, so I wondered if you went out."[lr]::
60377::$$$message_0549_0006_0001$$$::"Yeah, I just went out for a walk."::
60378::$$$message_0549_0007_0000$$$::...Oh, right. The lights were on when I got back.[lr]::
60379::$$$message_0549_0007_0001$$$::Has she been here the whole time?::
60380::$$$message_0549_0008_0000$$$::"Sakura, were you waiting here the whole time?"[lr]::
60381::$$$message_0549_0008_0001$$$::"Huh? N-no, I wasn't.[lr]::
60382::$$$message_0549_0008_0002$$$::I...just needed to use the bathroom and happened to pass by the entrance.::
60383::$$$message_0549_0009_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
60384::$$$message_0549_0009_0001$$$::She was definitely waiting for me.[lr]::
60385::$$$message_0549_0009_0002$$$::It's been just under 3 hours since Saber and I set out.[lr]::
60386::$$$message_0549_0009_0003$$$::Maybe Sakura noticed me leaving right away and waited here the entire time.::
60387::$$$message_0549_0010_0000$$$::"A-anyway, Senpai, would you like some tea!?[lr]::
60388::$$$message_0549_0010_0001$$$::I know it's late, but I think you'll feel better if you can relax with some warm tea!"::
60389::$$$message_0549_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60390::$$$message_0549_0011_0001$$$::My eyes widen.[lr]::
60391::$$$message_0549_0011_0002$$$::Suddenly, Sakura is uncharacteristically forceful.[lr]::
60392::$$$message_0549_0011_0003$$$::...I must be in pretty bad shape if she's this worried about me.::
60393::$$$message_0549_0012_0000$$$::"Yeah, thanks. It's good to be back. Sorry for going out without telling you."[lr]::
60394::$$$message_0549_0012_0001$$$::I take off my shoes and go inside.[lr]::
60395::$$$message_0549_0012_0002$$$::I keep a hand on my hurting stomach and head for the living room.::
60396::$$$message_0549_0013_0000$$$::Sakura steps in front of me.[lr]::
60397::$$$message_0549_0013_0001$$$::"Welcome home, Senpai."[lr]::
60398::$$$message_0549_0013_0002$$$::She replies, sounding somehow relieved.::
60399::$$$message_0549_0014_0000$$$::"Ouch."[lr]::
60400::$$$message_0549_0014_0001$$$::I jump up from the seat cushion my butt is on.[lr]::
60401::$$$message_0549_0014_0002$$$::The antiseptic drenching my back burns something fierce.[lr]::
60402::$$$message_0549_0014_0003$$$::It even makes a sizzling sound, making me feel like I'm being roasted over coals.::
60403::$$$message_0549_0015_0000$$$::"That hurts, Sakura. I don't need the antiseptic, so just dress the wounds with gauze."::
60404::$$$message_0549_0016_0000$$$::"I can't do that! Your back is all red, so I have to disinfect it! Of course it hurts, with injuries that bad. Just hold on a little longer."::
60405::$$$message_0549_0017_0000$$$::"Ow!"[lr]::
60406::$$$message_0549_0017_0001$$$::...Oof. I wonder if she's this tough on injured people thanks to the kyudo club, or Fuji-nee.::
60407::$$$message_0549_0018_0000$$$::"Does it hurt anywhere else, Senpai?"[lr]::
60408::$$$message_0549_0018_0001$$$::"Mmm... No, I only got hurt on my back and stomach. That's all."::
60409::$$$message_0549_0019_0000$$$::"Okay. Then I'll just tape some gauze over it."[lr]::
60410::$$$message_0549_0019_0001$$$::Sakura wields the first-aid kit with practiced efficiency.[lr]::
60411::$$$message_0549_0019_0002$$$::Her face is stern as she works, and I don't feel like I can interrupt her.::
60412::$$$message_0549_0020_0000$$$::"Whew."[lr]::
60413::$$$message_0549_0020_0001$$$::Now, then...[lr]::
60414::$$$message_0549_0020_0002$$$::If you're wondering how this happened, it's because I accidentally threw up the tea as soon as it hit my stomach.[lr]::
60415::$$$message_0549_0020_0003$$$::I'd planned on hiding it, but Sakura found out.::
60416::$$$message_0549_0021_0000$$$::Then, she pouted until I confessed that I got injured, and now she's treating my wounds.[lr]::
60417::$$$message_0549_0021_0001$$$::Of course, she wasn't this aggressive as soon as I got home.::
60418::$$$message_0549_0022_0000$$$::"Eh? Y-your stomach got injured!?"[lr]::
60419::$$$message_0549_0022_0001$$$::When I showed Sakura my abdomen,[lr]::
60420::$$$message_0549_0022_0002$$$::she blushed so furiously she couldn't even begin to render first aid.::
60421::$$$message_0549_0023_0000$$$::"Are you sure, Sakura? I can do it myself, so you don't have to make yourself do that. Plus, my back is worse."[lr]::
60422::$$$message_0549_0023_0001$$$::"I-it's okay! I'll do it! Please, let me!"[lr]::
60423::$$$message_0549_0023_0002$$$::She became so flustered that I was worried she would swoon before she could even treat my back.::
60424::$$$message_0549_0024_0000$$$::"S-S-S-Senpai, um, please take off your shirt."[lr]::
60425::$$$message_0549_0024_0001$$$::I didn't want to stop Sakura when she's trying so hard, and I couldn't have treated my back on my own.[lr]::
60426::$$$message_0549_0024_0002$$$::So, with all that in mind, I took off my shirt and let her work on my back.::
60427::$$$message_0549_0025_0000$$$::My back is scratched all over, and for a while, Sakura didn't do anything.[lr]::
60428::$$$message_0549_0025_0001$$$::After staring at each other for a few minutes, she gulped and announced that she'd start giving me first aid.::
60429::$$$message_0549_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60430::$$$message_0549_0026_0001$$$::That was 20 minutes ago.[lr]::
60431::$$$message_0549_0026_0002$$$::It's now past two in the morning.[lr]::
60432::$$$message_0549_0026_0003$$$::Sakura's diligent care is almost finished.::
60433::$$$message_0549_0027_0000$$$::"There, I'm done. I brought you a new shirt, so go ahead and put it on."[lr]::
60434::$$$message_0549_0027_0001$$$::"Huh? Oh, you're finished already? Thanks, Sakura."::
60435::$$$message_0549_0028_0000$$$::"No, thank you for your patience."[lr]::
60436::$$$message_0549_0028_0001$$$::I put on a fresh shirt and take a deep breath.[lr]::
60437::$$$message_0549_0028_0002$$$::I can't do much about the bruise on my stomach, but my back pain feels a little better.[lr]::
60438::$$$message_0549_0028_0003$$$::I'll sleep on my stomach tonight. Hopefully it won't hurt as much tomorrow.::
60439::$$$message_0549_0029_0000$$$::"I'd better get to bed, then. Sorry for making you stay up so late."[lr]::
60440::$$$message_0549_0029_0001$$$::"Huh? N-no, it wasn't any trouble, but..."[lr]::
60441::$$$message_0549_0029_0002$$$::Sakura looks down.[lr]::
60442::$$$message_0549_0029_0003$$$::She looks like she wants to say something, but can't.::
60443::$$$message_0549_0030_0000$$$::"Sakura? Did something happen while I was gone?"[lr]::
60444::$$$message_0549_0030_0001$$$::"...Um, Senpai, did Saber go home?"::
60445::$$$message_0549_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60446::$$$message_0549_0031_0001$$$::I go dizzy for a second.[lr]::
60447::$$$message_0549_0031_0002$$$::"Did Saber go home?"[r][wsay canskip=1]::
60448::$$$message_0549_0031_0003$$$::Hearing it out loud from someone else finally drives the hammer home.::
60449::$$$message_0549_0032_0000$$$::"Yeah. Something urgent came up, so she had to leave. She won't be coming back."::
60450::$$$message_0549_0033_0000$$$::I push through the dizziness, steady my breathing, and answer calmly.[lr]::
60451::$$$message_0549_0033_0001$$$::Sakura has doubts, I'm sure.[lr]::
60452::$$$message_0549_0033_0002$$$::Saber was just here four hours ago, so she must think something happened.[lr]::
60453::$$$message_0549_0033_0003$$$::So I need to be calmer than anyone and act like everything's fine.::
60454::$$$message_0549_0034_0000$$$::"Saber was talking about you earlier tonight. She said that you're too hard on yourself, and that you should lighten up."::
60455::$$$message_0549_0035_0000$$$::"...She did? We just made up, so I'm sorry that we couldn't say goodbye."[lr]::
60456::$$$message_0549_0035_0001$$$::   I can't even nod.[lr]::
60457::$$$message_0549_0035_0002$$$::Saber disappeared before she could say farewell to anyone.::
60458::$$$message_0549_0036_0000$$$::...It pains my heart so much I want to throw up.[lr]::
60459::$$$message_0549_0036_0001$$$::For only six days, we worked together.[lr]::
60460::$$$message_0549_0036_0002$$$::For only six days, we were partners.[lr]::
60461::$$$message_0549_0036_0003$$$::For only six days...she swore to be my sword, and how did I repay her?::
60462::$$$message_0549_0037_0000$$$::"But I'm glad to hear that. You've just been getting hurt since she arrived. Now everything can go back to normal."[lr]::
60463::$$$message_0549_0037_0001$$$::"Huh?"::
60464::$$$message_0549_0038_0000$$$::"Isn't that right? I won't ask what you've been up to, but you were going out at night for Saber, weren't you?[lr]::
60465::$$$message_0549_0038_0001$$$::Now that she's gone home, you won't have to be in danger anymore."::
60466::$$$message_0549_0039_0000$$$::"No. Saber might be gone, but I'm still going to go on my nighttime walks... Um, I wasn't going with her. I asked her to come with me."::
60467::$$$message_0549_0040_0000$$$::I stand up.[lr]::
60468::$$$message_0549_0040_0001$$$::I feel less tense now that the first aid is finished.[lr]::
60469::$$$message_0549_0040_0002$$$::I suddenly feel sleepy.::
60470::$$$message_0549_0041_0000$$$::"Eh? Sen...pai...?"[lr]::
60471::$$$message_0549_0041_0001$$$::"Good night, Sakura.[lr]::
60472::$$$message_0549_0041_0002$$$::About that[line2]I'm probably going to be out of the house from tomorrow, so make yourself at home like always.[lr]::
60473::$$$message_0549_0041_0003$$$::Make sure you get enough sleep, and don't worry about me coming home late. I don't want you waiting in the entrance all night again."::
60474::$$$message_0549_0042_0000$$$::"......Okay. Good night, Senpai."::
60475::$$$message_0549_0043_0000$$$::I can rest my body now.[lr]::
60476::$$$message_0549_0043_0001$$$::...I didn't notice before, but I'm seriously exhausted.[lr]::
60477::$$$message_0549_0043_0002$$$::Just lying down on my stomach is enough to make my body and mind sleepy.::
60478::$$$message_0549_0044_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60479::$$$message_0549_0044_0001$$$::Before I pass out, I stare into the dark, hardening my resolve.[lr]::
60480::$$$message_0549_0044_0002$$$::What defeated Saber? What am I supposed to fight?[lr]::
60481::$$$message_0549_0044_0003$$$::I need to get that through my head right now.::
60482::$$$message_0549_0045_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60483::$$$message_0549_0045_0001$$$::...The memory makes my chest creak.[lr]::
60484::$$$message_0549_0045_0002$$$::I tremble slightly, feeling a frustration that goes beyond anger or fear. I feel like my heart's going to break.::
60485::$$$message_0549_0046_0000$$$::"Who...I have to fight."[lr]::
60486::$$$message_0549_0046_0001$$$::That Shadow.[lr]::
60487::$$$message_0549_0046_0002$$$::That thing out there indiscriminately attacking people.[lr]::
60488::$$$message_0549_0046_0003$$$::The black shape that even Saber and Archer were afraid of.::
60489::$$$message_0549_0047_0000$$$::...I didn't see it happen, but I'm pretty sure of it.[lr]::
60490::$$$message_0549_0047_0001$$$::Saber lost to that thing.[lr]::
60491::$$$message_0549_0047_0002$$$::Assassin couldn't have beaten her.[lr]::
60492::$$$message_0549_0047_0003$$$::If anything back there could have defeated her, it had to have been that Shadow.::
60493::$$$message_0549_0048_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
60494::$$$message_0549_0048_0001$$$::I'll defeat the thing that beat Saber.[lr]::
60495::$$$message_0549_0048_0002$$$::It isn't my only enemy. I need to deal with Zouken and Assassin, too.[lr]::
60496::$$$message_0549_0048_0003$$$::Zouken said that he had no more use for me since I'm no longer a Master.[lr]::
60497::$$$message_0549_0048_0004$$$::But as long as I fight in the Holy Grail War and pursue the Shadow, Zouken is sure to appear.::
60498::$$$message_0549_0049_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
60499::$$$message_0549_0049_0001$$$::...My body trembles.[lr]::
60500::$$$message_0549_0049_0002$$$::Saber isn't here anymore.[lr]::
60501::$$$message_0549_0049_0003$$$::Without her miraculous healing, I only have my half-baked magecraft to protect me.[lr]::
60502::$$$message_0549_0049_0004$$$::I know how foolish and suicidal that is.::
60503::$$$message_0549_0050_0000$$$::"But I've decided to fight. I'm going to be a man who does what's right."[lr]::
60504::$$$message_0549_0050_0001$$$::I lost Saber to do that.[lr]::
60505::$$$message_0549_0050_0002$$$::It's why I've been following in Kiritsugu's footsteps ever since the fire.::
60506::$$$message_0549_0051_0000$$$::The only choice I have is to stop this war, so that the tragedy can never happen again.[lr]::
60507::$$$message_0549_0051_0001$$$::...And that's why this is the last night I'm allowed to tremble like this.[lr]::
60508::$$$message_0549_0051_0002$$$::In the morning, once my injuries have healed...[lr]::
60509::$$$message_0549_0051_0003$$$::I have to become a stronger version of myself that she would be proud of.::
