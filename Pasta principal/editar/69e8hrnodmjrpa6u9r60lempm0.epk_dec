34520::$$$message_0279_0000_0001$$$::She must have said something aloud on purpose.[lr]::
34521::$$$message_0279_0000_0002$$$::The Gandr's speed is slow and the black haze flies towards Kuzuki like a changeup pitch.::
34522::$$$message_0279_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34523::$$$message_0279_0001_0001$$$::A wind of disease that will cause him to be bedridden for two days.[lr]::
34524::$$$message_0279_0001_0002$$$::But two days of not being able to move would be fatal for a Master.[lr]::
34525::$$$message_0279_0001_0003$$$::There has to be some kind of reaction if Mr. Kuzuki is a Master.::
34526::$$$message_0279_0002_0000$$$::"Crap...!"[lr]::
34527::$$$message_0279_0002_0001$$$::Tohsaka moves.[lr]::
34528::$$$message_0279_0002_0002$$$::...Kuzuki doesn't react. Tohsaka's Gandr mercilessly hits Souichirou Kuzuki's head[line2][lr]::
34529::$$$message_0279_0002_0003$$$::It is interrupted just before that.[lr]::
34530::$$$message_0279_0002_0004$$$::A robe suddenly appears in the space between them.::
34531::$$$message_0279_0003_0000$$$::"...Hmm."[lr]::
34532::$$$message_0279_0003_0001$$$::The man who was supposed to be hit by the Gandr looks at us.[lr]::
34533::$$$message_0279_0003_0002$$$::As if he knew that we were here all along.::
34534::$$$message_0279_0004_0000$$$::"Tohsaka...!"[lr]::
34535::$$$message_0279_0004_0001$$$::I immediately pull the wooden sword out of the bag and put magical energy into it.[lr]::
34536::$$$message_0279_0004_0002$$$::I don't have the time to be fumbling around with Strengthening.::
34537::$$$message_0279_0005_0000$$$::The swirl of cloth in front of Kuzuki now takes shape.[lr]::
34538::$$$message_0279_0005_0001$$$::Slender limbs appear from the indigo robe.[lr]::
34539::$$$message_0279_0005_0002$$$::   Teleportation.[lr]::
34540::$$$message_0279_0005_0003$$$::Actual teleportation is considered True Magic in this modern world.[lr]::
34541::$$$message_0279_0005_0004$$$::This dark witch, Caster, uses such a Mystic with ease and appears before us.::
34542::$$$message_0279_0006_0000$$$::"I have warned you, Souichirou. I told you to stay at the temple since things like this can happen."[lr]::
34543::$$$message_0279_0006_0001$$$::She must not think anything of us, as Caster talks calmly to her Master...Kuzuki.[lr]::
34544::$$$message_0279_0006_0002$$$::"And yet this is not bad. We have managed quite the catch."::
34545::$$$message_0279_0007_0000$$$::"True. The fish aren't that large, but there is no doubt thatit is a worthy bounty... Now then. Come on out, you foolish mage."::
34546::$$$message_0279_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34547::$$$message_0279_0008_0001$$$::...It'd be difficult to run now.[lr]::
34548::$$$message_0279_0008_0002$$$::No, if Caster and her Master are in front of us, then all there is to do is fight them, even if this is the middle of the town.[lr]::
34549::$$$message_0279_0008_0003$$$::But, before that...::
34550::$$$message_0279_0009_0000$$$::"Are you not going to come out? That is too bad. I at least wanted to see what you looked like."[lr]::
34551::$$$message_0279_0009_0001$$$::"Ugh... What's with that fox? She already knows who we are..."::
34552::$$$message_0279_0010_0000$$$::Tohsaka curses in her hiding spot.[lr]::
34553::$$$message_0279_0010_0001$$$::She must've heard that.[lr]::
34554::$$$message_0279_0010_0002$$$::"I'll give you three seconds before I send your own spell back at you, little girl."[lr]::
34555::$$$message_0279_0010_0003$$$::Caster says cheerfully and points her hand towards us.::
34556::$$$message_0279_0011_0000$$$::   The absurdity of what she did before returns to my mind.[lr]::
34557::$$$message_0279_0011_0001$$$::She's not that naïve.[lr]::
34558::$$$message_0279_0011_0002$$$::I'm sure she would destroy this whole area, along with the wall that we're hiding behind.::
34559::$$$message_0279_0012_0000$$$::"Emiya, jump out when I give the signal. Saber, are you ready?"[lr]::
34560::$$$message_0279_0012_0001$$$::I sense her nodding behind me.[lr]::
34561::$$$message_0279_0012_0002$$$::    But...[lr]::
34562::$$$message_0279_0012_0003$$$::There's something that I need to confirm before that.::
34563::$$$message_0279_0013_0000$$$::"...Sorry. Do that later, Tohsaka."[lr]::
34564::$$$message_0279_0013_0001$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
34565::$$$message_0279_0013_0002$$$::I don't wait for her reply.[lr]::
34566::$$$message_0279_0013_0003$$$::I go out into the intersection from the shelter, wooden sword in hand.::
34567::$$$message_0279_0014_0000$$$::"Hey, Shirou...!"[lr]::
34568::$$$message_0279_0014_0001$$$::...Tohsaka must not have it in her to leave me alone in this and follows me out.::
34569::$$$message_0279_0015_0000$$$::"Oh, this is unexpected. Do you understand your position better now, boy?"[lr]::
34570::$$$message_0279_0015_0001$$$::Caster watches us calmly.[lr]::
34571::$$$message_0279_0015_0002$$$::...Kuzuki stands next to her.[lr]::
34572::$$$message_0279_0015_0003$$$::The distance between us is about ten meters.[lr]::
34573::$$$message_0279_0015_0004$$$::No matter how I think about it, Caster's fingertips would be much faster than me running to them...::
34574::$$$message_0279_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34575::$$$message_0279_0016_0001$$$::With full knowledge of the situation, I step forward.[lr]::
34576::$$$message_0279_0016_0002$$$::I have to do something before we fight.[lr]::
34577::$$$message_0279_0016_0003$$$::That is...::
34578::$$$message_0279_0017_0000$$$::"Tohsaka and Emiya, huh? So you two are Masters as well, like Matou? Although you are mages, fate certainly still has its way with you."[lr]::
34579::$$$message_0279_0017_0001$$$::...to confirm the identity of Souichirou Kuzuki as the one Caster is protecting.::
34580::$$$message_0279_0018_0000$$$::"What is it, Emiya? You have something to ask?"[lr]::
34581::$$$message_0279_0018_0001$$$::He asks in his usual manner.[lr]::
34582::$$$message_0279_0018_0002$$$::I don't feel the presence of a mage from Mr. Kuzuki.[lr]::
34583::$$$message_0279_0018_0003$$$::No, I don't even feel a desire for victory in this so-called war.[lr]::
34584::$$$message_0279_0018_0004$$$::Then...::
34585::$$$message_0279_0019_0000$$$::"Kuzuki. Has Caster put you up to this?"[lr]::
34586::$$$message_0279_0019_0001$$$::It's possible that Mr. Kuzuki is being manipulated by Caster like Archer said.[lr]::
34587::$$$message_0279_0019_0002$$$::Until I get this cleared up, I just can't fight him.::
34588::$$$message_0279_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34589::$$$message_0279_0020_0001$$$::I can feel Caster's desire to kill me.[lr]::
34590::$$$message_0279_0020_0002$$$::That alone tells me that question is off-limits for her.::
34591::$$$message_0279_0021_0000$$$::"...Shut up, boy. I should kill you."[lr]::
34592::$$$message_0279_0021_0001$$$::Yet her words are not quite a threat.[lr]::
34593::$$$message_0279_0021_0002$$$::However...[lr]::
34594::$$$message_0279_0021_0003$$$::"Hold on. Why are you asking that, Emiya?"[lr]::
34595::$$$message_0279_0021_0004$$$::Mr. Kuzuki stops her in his usual manner.::
34596::$$$message_0279_0022_0000$$$::"There must be a reason for your question. Tell me."[lr]::
34597::$$$message_0279_0022_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34598::$$$message_0279_0022_0002$$$::...My throat is dry.[lr]::
34599::$$$message_0279_0022_0003$$$::It must be Caster's murderous glare. The woman in the indigo robe tells me without words that she'll kill me if I say something wrong.[lr]::
34600::$$$message_0279_0022_0004$$$::I bear it and...::
34601::$$$message_0279_0023_0000$$$::"...I don't know how you became a Master. But you're a decent person, right? Then there's no way that you're overlooking what Caster is doing.[lr]::
34602::$$$message_0279_0023_0001$$$::But since it seems like you are, I just thought that you might not know about it."[lr]::
34603::$$$message_0279_0023_0002$$$::I glare back at Caster.::
34604::$$$message_0279_0024_0000$$$::"What Caster is doing?"[lr]::
34605::$$$message_0279_0024_0001$$$::"...Yeah. She's holing up in Ryudou Temple and collecting magical energy from the people in this town. The coma incidents that have been happening recently are all her doing." ::
34606::$$$message_0279_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34607::$$$message_0279_0025_0001$$$::"The victim count has been increasing as well. As long as Caster continues stealing magical energy, I'm sure there will be people who will die eventually.[lr]::
34608::$$$message_0279_0025_0002$$$:: ...She said that everyone in this town is a sacrifice. It won't be long before it's too late."::
34609::$$$message_0279_0026_0000$$$::"I see, so that is what you mean. A virtuous person would not let Caster be.[lr]::
34610::$$$message_0279_0026_0001$$$::Yet, as I am letting her run free as her Master, you thought I may be under her sway in some fashion."::
34611::$$$message_0279_0027_0000$$$::"...Yeah. If you're still letting her be while knowing what she's doing, then you're just a murderer. I won't hold back. But it's a different story if you're being manipulated in all of this.[lr]::
34612::$$$message_0279_0027_0001$$$::We'll just defeat Caster."[lr]::
34613::$$$message_0279_0027_0002$$$::"No. This is the first time I've heard of this."::
34614::$$$message_0279_0028_0000$$$::His statement leaves no room for interpretation. [lr]::
34615::$$$message_0279_0028_0001$$$::He doesn't seem to be lying, either. Souichirou Kuzuki is the same as when he lectures at school.::
34616::$$$message_0279_0029_0000$$$::"...Phew."[lr]::
34617::$$$message_0279_0029_0001$$$::Though relieved, I still keep my guard up against Caster.[lr]::
34618::$$$message_0279_0029_0002$$$::Mr. Kuzuki is also a victim if he's being manipulated.[lr]::
34619::$$$message_0279_0029_0003$$$::So, all that's left is to defeat Caster[line2]::
34620::$$$message_0279_0030_0000$$$::"However, Emiya, are Caster's actions really so bad?"[lr]::
34621::$$$message_0279_0030_0001$$$::   And yet still...[lr]::
34622::$$$message_0279_0030_0002$$$::Souichirou Kuzuki says this as well.::
34623::$$$message_0279_0031_0000$$$::"What...are you...?"::
34624::$$$message_0279_0032_0000$$$::"It does not concern me how many strangers die. And besides, Caster has not taken anyone's life.[lr]::
34625::$$$message_0279_0032_0001$$$::Though I daresay, Caster, you have chosen a half-hearted measure. If you are going to do such a thing, you might as well take their life."::
34626::$$$message_0279_0033_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
34627::$$$message_0279_0033_0001$$$::The way he says it is no different than usual.[lr]::
34628::$$$message_0279_0033_0002$$$::He gives his honest opinion. Souichirou Kuzuki is the same as when he lectures at school.::
34629::$$$message_0279_0034_0000$$$::"Are you going to involve innocent people in this...!?"[lr]::
34630::$$$message_0279_0034_0001$$$::"Other people are irrelevant... Well, I suppose you have correctly guessed my true nature.[lr]::
34631::$$$message_0279_0034_0002$$$::I am not a mage. I am just a murderer, spending his days wasting away."::
34632::$$$message_0279_0035_0000$$$::Kuzuki takes a step back.[lr]::
34633::$$$message_0279_0035_0001$$$::He watches us from behind Caster.::
34634::$$$message_0279_0036_0000$$$::"You are correct to assume I am Caster's puppet.[lr]::
34635::$$$message_0279_0036_0001$$$::I do not care about the Holy Grail War. If Caster and the two of you are going to kill each other, I will simply observe.[lr]::
34636::$$$message_0279_0036_0002$$$::Most of all..."::
34637::$$$message_0279_0037_0000$$$::I value my own life. I do not care what Caster is scheming. I just kill whoever gets in my way.[lr]::
34638::$$$message_0279_0037_0001$$$::Do as you wish, Caster. It is up to you whether you let them live or die."::
34639::$$$message_0279_0038_0000$$$::Caster stands in front of us, smiling in victory.::
34640::$$$message_0279_0039_0000$$$::"Ugh... So they're both underhanded foxes...!"[lr]::
34641::$$$message_0279_0039_0001$$$::Tohsaka clicks her tongue and doesn't move.[lr]::
34642::$$$message_0279_0039_0002$$$::Or rather, she can't move.[lr]::
34643::$$$message_0279_0039_0003$$$::In terms of skill as a mage, we aren't a match for Caster even put together.[lr]::
34644::$$$message_0279_0039_0004$$$::For Masters who claim to be mages, an opponent like Caster far exceeds what we're capable of.::
34645::$$$message_0279_0040_0000$$$::"...I see.[lr]::
34646::$$$message_0279_0040_0001$$$::Then, you do not mind dying here, Caster's Master?"::
34647::$$$message_0279_0041_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
34648::$$$message_0279_0041_0001$$$::A voice behind me.[lr]::
34649::$$$message_0279_0041_0002$$$::Before I can turn around...[lr]::
34650::$$$message_0279_0041_0003$$$::The knight of the sword, the Servant Saber, dashes forward.::
34651::$$$message_0279_0042_0000$$$::"...Saber!?"[lr]::
34652::$$$message_0279_0042_0001$$$::My voice can't even keep up.[lr]::
34653::$$$message_0279_0042_0002$$$::Saber, already clad in silver, charges towards Kuzuki like a gust of wind.::
34654::$$$message_0279_0043_0000$$$::"...Stop right there, Saber!"::
34655::$$$message_0279_0044_0000$$$::Caster confronts her with a spell.[lr]::
34656::$$$message_0279_0044_0001$$$::She recites five verses.[lr]::
34657::$$$message_0279_0044_0002$$$::If Saber is a gust of wind for completing ten meters in a breath, then Caster must be lightning for casting a spell even faster.::
34658::$$$message_0279_0044_0003$$$::A bolt of lightning from a raging storm.[lr]::
34659::$$$message_0279_0044_0004$$$::Five bullets of light are shot in less than a second and stab at Saber like fatal thorns...!::
34660::$$$message_0279_0044_0005$$$::"Magic Resistance...! No, I do not know of any knight who can defend against my magecraft...!"::
34661::$$$message_0279_0045_0000$$$::Caster screams.[lr]::
34662::$$$message_0279_0045_0001$$$::Even Archer had to dodge Caster's spell, but Saber is nullifying it just by glaring at it.::
34663::$$$message_0279_0046_0000$$$::Yet her focus is not Caster.[lr]::
34664::$$$message_0279_0046_0001$$$::Her target...[lr]::
34665::$$$message_0279_0046_0002$$$::The opponent that she must slash is none other than the Master, Souichirou Kuzuki...!::
34666::$$$message_0279_0047_0000$$$::Saber slashes Kuzuki without hesitation.[lr]::
34667::$$$message_0279_0047_0001$$$::"Lord Souichirou..."[lr]::
34668::$$$message_0279_0047_0002$$$::...Silence returns to the intersection.[lr]::
34669::$$$message_0279_0047_0003$$$::Saber is frozen after slashing her sword.[lr]::
34670::$$$message_0279_0047_0004$$$::Everyone here assumes the match is decided because of how quick the attack was.::
34671::$$$message_0279_0048_0000$$$::...Yes.[lr]::
34672::$$$message_0279_0048_0001$$$::Everyone except Souichirou Kuzuki, who stands there calmly.::
