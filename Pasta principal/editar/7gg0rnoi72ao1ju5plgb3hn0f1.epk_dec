7624::$$$message_0072_0000_0000$$$::Good evening! This is Tiger Dojo, your friendly segment chock full of hints for those who love dying all the time!::
7625::$$$message_0072_0000_0001$$$::And I'm Illya, the disciple!::
7626::$$$message_0072_0000_0002$$$::We're almost halfway through the main storyline. Big Sis here sure is glad to see Shirou finally starting to get serious about fighting.::
7627::$$$message_0072_0000_0003$$$::But I have to say, this was a pretty boneheaded choice. Were you even listening to Saber's advice?::
7628::$$$message_0072_0000_0004$$$::Of course not! Saber and Rin do too much explaining. It's such a drag, I always skip the training scenes!::
7629::$$$message_0072_0000_0005$$$::You idiot!::
7630::$$$message_0072_0000_0006$$$::Ouch...I-I'm sorry...! I was just fibbing a little.::
7631::$$$message_0072_0000_0007$$$::Sheesh. Listen. Unless things get really bad, you need to avoid fighting Servants head-on.::
7632::$$$message_0072_0000_0008$$$::Hang in there and opportunities will present themselves. Be patient for now, and let your opponent do as they wish.::
7633::$$$message_0072_0000_0009$$$::Ma'am, yes, ma'am![lr]::
7634::$$$message_0072_0000_0010$$$::By the way, Mentor, I see that you give these stamps out whenever we visit this dojo. What is that about?::
7635::$$$message_0072_0000_0011$$$::This is a Tiger Stamp. Collecting them gives you a sense of satisfaction, and it's also a good way to see how much progress you've made.::
7636::$$$message_0072_0000_0012$$$::And if you collect them all...::
7637::$$$message_0072_0000_0013$$$::If you collect them all...?::
7638::$$$message_0072_0000_0014$$$::The game screen will be completely filled with paws![lr]::
7639::$$$message_0072_0000_0015$$$::Scary!::
7640::$$$message_0072_0000_0016$$$::Kyaaah! What a perfect world!::
7641::$$$message_0072_0000_0017$$$::So I can't be blamed if you go out of your way to collect them![lr]::
7642::$$$message_0072_0000_0018$$$::So there you have it. I'll see you at the next Tiger Dojo!::
7643::$$$message_0072_0000_0019$$$::We'll be waiting! ::
