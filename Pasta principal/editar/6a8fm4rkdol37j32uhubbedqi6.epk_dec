23278::$$$message_0206_0000_0000$$$::                                           I'm having a bad dream.::
23279::$$$message_0206_0001_0000$$$::My body, injured as it is, demands long, deep sleep.[lr]::
23280::$$$message_0206_0001_0001$$$::But my mind is still stuck replaying all that happened today, and won't let me rest peacefully.[lr]::
23281::$$$message_0206_0001_0002$$$::My body, still not fully healed, is burning. My mind is plagued with guilt.::
23282::$$$message_0206_0002_0000$$$::I think I'm crying out in my sleep.[lr]::
23283::$$$message_0206_0002_0001$$$::As I sleep, my dream drags on.::
23284::$$$message_0206_0003_0000$$$::...How many victims were there?[lr]::
23285::$$$message_0206_0003_0001$$$::Tohsaka said there were no deaths, but that might just be the official story.[lr]::
23286::$$$message_0206_0003_0002$$$::No way does someone come out unscathed after having their life force ripped from them.[lr]::
23287::$$$message_0206_0003_0003$$$::They could suffer any number of long-term physical problems in years to come, or even brain damage from lack of oxygen.[lr]::
23288::$$$message_0206_0003_0004$$$::Some students even had severe skin damage.[lr]::
23289::$$$message_0206_0003_0005$$$::Even if they heal, they'll likely have scars for the rest of their lives.::
23290::$$$message_0206_0004_0000$$$::...My body hurts.[lr]::
23291::$$$message_0206_0004_0001$$$::I nearly died today... No, I [font italic=true]did[font italic=false] die today. A convulsion rocks my whole body.[lr]::
23292::$$$message_0206_0004_0002$$$::Bad luck for everyone who got sucked into this today, but you did well, Shirou.[lr]::
23293::$$$message_0206_0004_0003$$$::You stopped a catastrophe, and you did it by taking a wound that would normally kill you.[lr]::
23294::$$$message_0206_0004_0004$$$::There's nothing to feel guilty about.[lr]::
23295::$$$message_0206_0004_0005$$$::The pain tries to tell me to just go to sleep.::
23296::$$$message_0206_0005_0000$$$::No.[lr]::
23297::$$$message_0206_0005_0001$$$::I can't make excuses for myself.::
23298::$$$message_0206_0006_0000$$$::It doesn't matter. There was a disaster, and I just happened to be there. But I couldn't do anything.[lr]::
23299::$$$message_0206_0006_0001$$$::They're saying I saved lives.[lr]::
23300::$$$message_0206_0006_0002$$$::But...I didn't save anyone. Not one person.[lr]::
23301::$$$message_0206_0006_0003$$$::If only this had just been a mistake, if only it hadn't happened...then my mind would be at peace and I could sleep.::
23302::$$$message_0206_0007_0000$$$::...I'm pissed off.[lr]::
23303::$$$message_0206_0007_0001$$$::It's absurd, my heart complaining like this when my body's already so weak.::
23304::$$$message_0206_0008_0000$$$::There won't be a miracle like that.::
23305::$$$message_0206_0009_0000$$$::Just wishing for a do-over because things didn't go well, or were so terrible they should never have happened...is pathetic.[lr]::
23306::$$$message_0206_0009_0001$$$::You can't take back what's already done.[lr]::
23307::$$$message_0206_0009_0002$$$::It's not possible, and shouldn't be attempted anyway.::
23308::$$$message_0206_0010_0000$$$::So I can't just pretend all that didn't happen.[lr]::
23309::$$$message_0206_0010_0001$$$::There's only one thing I [font italic=true]can[font italic=false] do: make sure I do everything I possibly can to prevent anything like that from ever happening again.::
23310::$$$message_0206_0011_0000$$$::That's enough sleep.[lr]::
23311::$$$message_0206_0011_0001$$$::I can worry about my body later.[lr]::
23312::$$$message_0206_0011_0002$$$::If I can move, I should wake up and hit the ground running.[lr]::
23313::$$$message_0206_0011_0003$$$::If my goal is to make sure no one is hurt, I'll need to push myself to the verge of death[line2]::
23314::$$$message_0206_0012_0000$$$::I open my eyes.[lr]::
23315::$$$message_0206_0012_0001$$$::I take one deep breath, filling my lungs with air.::
23316::$$$message_0206_0013_0000$$$::"...Haaa."[lr]::
23317::$$$message_0206_0013_0001$$$::The frigid winter air dispels my drowsiness almost instantly.[lr]::
23318::$$$message_0206_0013_0002$$$::I realize it's just past six in the morning. Habits really are extraordinary things.[lr]::
23319::$$$message_0206_0013_0003$$$::My body must have at least partly recovered, since I'm waking up at my usual time.::
23320::$$$message_0206_0014_0000$$$::"...Okay."[lr]::
23321::$$$message_0206_0014_0001$$$::I stand up and fold up my futon blanket.[lr]::
23322::$$$message_0206_0014_0002$$$::The instant I undertake even such a mundane task...[lr]::
23323::$$$message_0206_0014_0003$$$::...intense pain spikes through my left shoulder.::
23324::$$$message_0206_0015_0000$$$::"...Ngh. Yeah, I guess I'm not completely healed."[lr]::
23325::$$$message_0206_0015_0001$$$::It's only pain, though.[lr]::
23326::$$$message_0206_0015_0002$$$::This is far better than what I felt when Berserker tore out my stomach the other day.[lr]::
23327::$$$message_0206_0015_0003$$$::When that happened, my insides felt like they were slush, and the nausea was far more intense than the pain.::
23328::$$$message_0206_0016_0000$$$::I head out to the hallway.[lr]::
23329::$$$message_0206_0016_0001$$$::The sunlight is muted by the gloom outside.[lr]::
23330::$$$message_0206_0016_0002$$$::It's cloudy; looks like it's going to rain.::
23331::$$$message_0206_0017_0000$$$::"Shirou. Have you awoken?"[lr]::
23332::$$$message_0206_0017_0001$$$::"Yeah. I just woke up. You're up early. You're usually asleep around now."[lr]::
23333::$$$message_0206_0017_0002$$$::Yeah, Saber's not typically up so long before breakfast.::
23334::$$$message_0206_0018_0000$$$::"Shirou. I do not sleep because I want to. I have mentioned this before, but I only sleep until breakfast to conserve my magical energy.[lr]::
23335::$$$message_0206_0018_0001$$$::I would appreciate you not suggesting that I have been merely sleeping in."::
23336::$$$message_0206_0019_0000$$$::"Why? I didn't mean for it to sound like that.[lr]::
23337::$$$message_0206_0019_0001$$$::I was more asking if it was okay for you to be awake so early."[lr]::
23338::$$$message_0206_0019_0002$$$::"Oh, were you? So you are saying that you find me being an early riser odd..."::
23339::$$$message_0206_0020_0000$$$::Saber sounds crabby.[lr]::
23340::$$$message_0206_0020_0001$$$::Maybe it's my imagination.[lr]::
23341::$$$message_0206_0020_0002$$$::Saber doesn't seem quite as...reserved as usual.::
23342::$$$message_0206_0021_0000$$$::"No, I didn't say it was strange... I was just wondering if it was okay.[lr]::
23343::$$$message_0206_0021_0001$$$::It's my fault that you need to sleep so much. So don't you need to sleep as much as possible today too?"::
23344::$$$message_0206_0022_0000$$$::"Of course. But I am simply remaining on standby. I am sleeping in anticipation of emergencies, so I do not think it is logical for me to sleep right now."::
23345::$$$message_0206_0023_0000$$$::"What do you mean, it's not logical? We're not fighting anybody right now, and nobody's attacking us."[lr]::
23346::$$$message_0206_0023_0001$$$::"Ah...um, well, that is..."[lr]::
23347::$$$message_0206_0023_0002$$$::Saber's stumbling over her words... It seems like there's something she doesn't want to say.::
23348::$$$message_0206_0024_0000$$$::"Well, whatever. There's no emergency, so you should sleep until the next time we go out.[lr]::
23349::$$$message_0206_0024_0001$$$::I'll call you up when breakfast's ready, so just save your strength until then. I'm going to need your help all day today."[lr]::
23350::$$$message_0206_0024_0002$$$::I head to the kitchen.::
23351::$$$message_0206_0025_0000$$$::"Please wait, Shirou."[lr]::
23352::$$$message_0206_0025_0001$$$::"Huh? What, do you have something els[line2]"::
23353::$$$message_0206_0026_0000$$$::"What did you just say you were going to do?"::
23354::$$$message_0206_0027_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
23355::$$$message_0206_0027_0001$$$::I hold my breath, barely realizing I'm doing it.[lr]::
23356::$$$message_0206_0027_0002$$$::She's asked me something, but her eyes are preventing me from giving an answer.::
23357::$$$message_0206_0028_0000$$$::"You should be resting.[lr]::
23358::$$$message_0206_0028_0001$$$::Rin will prepare breakfast. Your priority is recuperating in your room and letting your body heal. If you do not understand this, then I will not hear your answer to my question."::
23359::$$$message_0206_0029_0000$$$::"Saber..."[lr]::
23360::$$$message_0206_0029_0001$$$::Saber's being so stern because she's genuinely concerned about me.::
23361::$$$message_0206_0030_0000$$$::"Please return to your room, Shirou. You are the one who should be sleeping, not me."[lr]::
23362::$$$message_0206_0030_0001$$$::Saber sees right through me, and glares at me all the more intensely.[lr]::
23363::$$$message_0206_0030_0002$$$::But still...I can't let Shinji let loose.::
23364::$$$message_0206_0031_0000$$$::"No. I'm not going to go back to my room. I've rested enough, and there are things I need to do. Once we're ready, let's head out to town, Saber. We're going to catch Shinji. Today."::
23365::$$$message_0206_0032_0000$$$::"Why? There is no particular reason we need to capture Rider's Master today. If we are to fight, we should do it after your wounds have healed. It will not be too late."[lr]::
23366::$$$message_0206_0032_0001$$$::"You've got it wrong, Saber. If we're setting priorities, my body is at the bottom of the list."::
23367::$$$message_0206_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
23368::$$$message_0206_0033_0001$$$::"We don't have the luxury of waiting. You know exactly what Shinji is willing to do. We need to separate him from Rider before they make another Bounded Field. He won't be a threat if he doesn't have a Servant."::
23369::$$$message_0206_0034_0000$$$::"So you are saying you do not want more victims, like yesterday. Is that why you are doing this? Not to defeat Rider's Master?"::
23370::$$$message_0206_0035_0000$$$::"That's not true. I'm going to hold Shinji accountable. To do that, we need to defeat Rider.[lr]::
23371::$$$message_0206_0035_0001$$$::And it's the right thing to do, to prevent more victims. That's the most important reason we have to fight."::
23372::$$$message_0206_0036_0000$$$::"...I see.[lr]::
23373::$$$message_0206_0036_0001$$$::If that is Master's command, I will obey."::
23374::$$$message_0206_0037_0000$$$::"Find Shinji? Well, I don't really have a problem with that, but you're saying this because you think you have a chance at winning, right?"::
23375::$$$message_0206_0038_0000$$$::It's after breakfast.[lr]::
23376::$$$message_0206_0038_0001$$$::That's Tohsaka's immediate response when I say we can't just let Shinji remain on the run.::
23377::$$$message_0206_0039_0000$$$::"Eh? You're asking about my chances of beating Shinji?"[lr]::
23378::$$$message_0206_0039_0001$$$::"That's right. I'll be honest here, if you're planning on going up against a Master without a hope of winning, I'm going to die laughing."::
23379::$$$message_0206_0040_0000$$$::"Ah...um..."[lr]::
23380::$$$message_0206_0040_0001$$$::...Crap.[lr]::
23381::$$$message_0206_0040_0002$$$::Now that she mentions it, I've really only thought about stopping Shinji. I haven't given much thought to the details. Or...any.::
23382::$$$message_0206_0041_0000$$$::"Uh...Emiya, are you serious!?"[lr]::
23383::$$$message_0206_0041_0001$$$::"Ugh...sorry. Laugh all you want."[lr]::
23384::$$$message_0206_0041_0002$$$::"Oh. Wow. Sorry, that's [font italic=true]really[font italic=false] not funny."::
23385::$$$message_0206_0042_0000$$$::Ugh... That reaction makes it clear just how stupid I'm being. I want to curl up into a little ball and hide.::
23386::$$$message_0206_0043_0000$$$::"Saber. Your Master's talking nonsense, so what do you think? Do you have a problem with fighting Rider?"::
23387::$$$message_0206_0044_0000$$$::"I have no qualms about fighting Rider. I have already assessed her strength.[lr]::
23388::$$$message_0206_0044_0001$$$::And I believe Shirou has also gauged her abilities. He confronted her directly as well."::
23389::$$$message_0206_0045_0000$$$::"Oh really? So Shirou knows how strong she is too?"[lr]::
23390::$$$message_0206_0045_0001$$$::Tohsaka looks my way, her eyes curious.[lr]::
23391::$$$message_0206_0045_0002$$$::She obviously wants to know about how strong Rider is.::
23392::$$$message_0206_0046_0000$$$::True, I do have...something of an assessment.[lr]::
23393::$$$message_0206_0046_0001$$$::Maybe it's because I've formed a contract with a Servant, or maybe it's the power of the Command Spells.[lr]::
23394::$$$message_0206_0046_0002$$$::She may not be my Servant, but I have some understanding of her abilities since I've seen her fight.[lr]::
23395::$$$message_0206_0046_0003$$$::Rider wasn't an especially strong Servant.::
23396::$$$message_0206_0047_0000$$$::"Rider isn't as strong as Saber. If they fight one-on-one, I don't see Saber losing."::
23397::$$$message_0206_0048_0000$$$::"I see. So you do have a chance at winning.[lr]::
23398::$$$message_0206_0048_0001$$$::Shinji's not a mage, so Rider can't get any support from her Master. So it'll come down to a duel between Saber and Rider."::
23399::$$$message_0206_0049_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
23400::$$$message_0206_0049_0001$$$::Tohsaka's right.[lr]::
23401::$$$message_0206_0049_0002$$$::As long as Shinji's a Master, Rider has to fight on her own.[lr]::
23402::$$$message_0206_0049_0003$$$::Saber shouldn't be at a disadvantage, but...::
23403::$$$message_0206_0050_0000$$$::"Why the long face? There a problem?"::
23404::$$$message_0206_0051_0000$$$::"Yeah. Listen, Tohsaka...even though Saber had Rider cornered, and Saber is waaay superior in combat, Rider managed to escape with Shinji.[lr]::
23405::$$$message_0206_0051_0001$$$::I think it was Rider's Noble Phantasm..."::
23406::$$$message_0206_0052_0000$$$::The arrow of light that tore through the hallway.[lr]::
23407::$$$message_0206_0052_0001$$$::If Saber hadn't shoved me to the ground, that wave of destruction would have completely annihilated me.[lr]::
23408::$$$message_0206_0052_0002$$$::If that was Rider's ace in the hole, we shouldn't take her lightly...even if she [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] weaker.::
23409::$$$message_0206_0053_0000$$$::"Hmmm? So that means Rider is one of those types whose Noble Phantasm is more powerful than the Servant itself."::
23410::$$$message_0206_0054_0000$$$::"So, Saber. Shirou aside, you must have been able to tell what Rider's Noble Phantasm was, right? You should have some idea since it was deployed in front of you."::
23411::$$$message_0206_0055_0000$$$::"I must apologize. I was so intent on protecting Shirou, I was not able to determine what it was.[lr]::
23412::$$$message_0206_0055_0001$$$::Had I taken the time to do so, Shirou and I would have been caught up in it."::
23413::$$$message_0206_0056_0000$$$::"Caught up in it? Is Rider's Noble Phantasm a projectile?"::
23414::$$$message_0206_0057_0000$$$::"It certainly seemed similar to one. It can likely be classified as something close to your magecraft. That was not an anti-personnel Noble Phantasm, like my sword or Lancer's spear."::
23415::$$$message_0206_0058_0000$$$::"It's close to my magecraft? That doesn't sound right.[lr]::
23416::$$$message_0206_0058_0001$$$::Your magic resistance is god-tier. Modern magecraft just can't hurt you. If there was magecraft you actually needed to avoid, it would be..."::
23417::$$$message_0206_0059_0000$$$::"Yes. Mystics would have to be nullified with even stronger Mystics.[lr]::
23418::$$$message_0206_0059_0001$$$::The only type of Mystics that can penetrate my armor would be what you call True Magic, or Phantasmals of the divine realm."[lr]::
23419::$$$message_0206_0059_0002$$$::"True Magician...are you trying to say that Rider is a mage!?"::
23420::$$$message_0206_0060_0000$$$::"No. I did not feel that much magical energy from her.[lr]::
23421::$$$message_0206_0060_0001$$$::She is Rider. If there is a True Magician around, it could only be Caster. Rider's Noble Phantasm is likely something different."::
23422::$$$message_0206_0061_0000$$$::Saber's answer gets a sigh of relief from Tohsaka.[lr]::
23423::$$$message_0206_0061_0001$$$::I don't quite get what's going on though.::
23424::$$$message_0206_0062_0000$$$::"Saber. Is your armor that strong? You say only True Magic can penetrate it, so does that mean Lancer's G치e Bolg is True Magic?"::
23425::$$$message_0206_0063_0000$$$::"Hm? Yes. You're right, Lancer's G치e Bolg is a curse, close in power to True Magic. Rin, would you care to explain this to Shirou?"::
23426::$$$message_0206_0064_0000$$$::"Me? Well, fine. Let's just cut to the chase: you believe Saber can only be injured by True Magic, right?"::
23427::$$$message_0206_0065_0000$$$::"Uh, well...that's not what I'm saying...[lr]::
23428::$$$message_0206_0065_0001$$$::But I just thought it was amazing that her armor's that strong."::
23429::$$$message_0206_0066_0000$$$::"Of course it's amazing. All Servants are Heroic Spirits...not just Saber, you know? They're spirits, so they can't be harmed by ordinary means, since Servants themselves are Mystics."::
23430::$$$message_0206_0067_0000$$$::"Only fellow Servants, since they're also Heroic Spirits, can physically harm other Servants. On the flip side, so long as we're dealing with a Servant, they could wound Saber even if they grabbed something like a paper cutter."::
23431::$$$message_0206_0068_0000$$$::"So what you're saying is that Saber's armor isn't invulnerable when she's dealing with another Servant."::
23432::$$$message_0206_0069_0000$$$::"Yep. But Saber is skilled at close combat, so there's no way she'd be wounded in hand-to-hand combat.[lr]::
23433::$$$message_0206_0069_0001$$$::The only other method would be to attack her form a long distance... Like with a magecraft projectile. But Saber has, despite being a knight, remarkable magic resistance, so she can deflect most magecraft."::
23434::$$$message_0206_0070_0000$$$::"Curses, the epitome of bad luck, can't touch her, while more direct intervention, like firing magical energy at her like arrows, also won't work.[lr]::
23435::$$$message_0206_0070_0001$$$::If someone wants to defeat Saber, they'll have to fight her head-on and beat her that way."::
23436::$$$message_0206_0071_0000$$$::Saber listens silently to Tohsaka's explanation.[lr]::
23437::$$$message_0206_0071_0001$$$::Saber never interrupts her, probably because everything Tohsaka's saying is true.::
23438::$$$message_0206_0072_0000$$$::"What the hell? That's like cheating.[lr]::
23439::$$$message_0206_0072_0001$$$::Someone would try to go up against Saber with magecraft because they can't beat her in single combat? But if magecraft itself is useless against her, what can they do?[lr]::
23440::$$$message_0206_0072_0002$$$::That sounds unfair."::
23441::$$$message_0206_0073_0000$$$::"That may be true. But it doesn't mean Saber is unbeatable in hand-to-hand combat.[lr]::
23442::$$$message_0206_0073_0001$$$::Berserker is much stronger than Saber, and even Lancer has his spear, which can be fatal.[lr]::
23443::$$$message_0206_0073_0002$$$::And we were just talking about Rider having a Noble Phantasm that could beat even Saber. So we're not saying Saber is perfect."::
23444::$$$message_0206_0074_0000$$$::"Even we have ways to defeat Saber.[lr]::
23445::$$$message_0206_0074_0001$$$::We just need to use magecraft that exceeds Saber's magic resistance, or borrow a weapon wielded by a Servant to cut her head off while she's sleeping... Servants' weapons are spiritual too, so they should be able to hurt her."::
23446::$$$message_0206_0075_0000$$$::"...Hm."[lr]::
23447::$$$message_0206_0075_0001$$$::It's an alarming example, but I get it.[lr]::
23448::$$$message_0206_0075_0002$$$::   Wait. But hold on, Tohsaka...[lr]::
23449::$$$message_0206_0075_0003$$$::We probably shouldn't be talking about things like this in front of Saber.::
23450::$$$message_0206_0076_0000$$$::"I-I see...[lr]::
23451::$$$message_0206_0076_0001$$$::So it's not that Rider's Noble Phantasm was exceptional; Saber just went on the defensive because it was a Servant that was attacking."::
23452::$$$message_0206_0077_0000$$$::"You got it wrong. If Saber was focusing on defending, Rider wouldn't be able to finish her off alone. If Rider isn't a particularly exceptional Heroic Spirit, it wouldn't amount to much, even with her Noble Phantasm in the mix.[lr]::
23453::$$$message_0206_0077_0001$$$::Do you agree, Saber? You think Rider's Noble Phantasm is unrelated to her abilities, right?"::
23454::$$$message_0206_0078_0000$$$::"Most likely, yes. I believe it was an autonomous weapon that does not rely on Rider's skill, and that it has an effect on the Noble Phantasm itself.[lr]::
23455::$$$message_0206_0078_0001$$$::It is either magecraft or Phantasmal.[lr]::
23456::$$$message_0206_0078_0002$$$::Whatever it is, the intensity from the magic circle was overwhelming. I do not think many Servants could survive a direct strike."::
23457::$$$message_0206_0079_0000$$$::"Really? By how much, quantifiably?"[lr]::
23458::$$$message_0206_0079_0001$$$::"If I were to describe it in your terms, I would rank it at perhaps A+. This is a matter of opinion though, as I am not certain."::
23459::$$$message_0206_0080_0000$$$::"A+!? That's one step below True Magic![lr]::
23460::$$$message_0206_0080_0001$$$::Whoa, I can't believe it didn't just blow the entire school to bits!"::
23461::$$$message_0206_0081_0000$$$::"It must not be a purely destructive Noble Phantasm. It may have originally served a different purpose."::
23462::$$$message_0206_0082_0000$$$::"...Maybe. But this is a problem. According to Saber, it's beyond an A rank. In terms of raw power, that attack might be one of the strongest out of all the Servants."::
23463::$$$message_0206_0083_0000$$$::"...Hm. Yes it did seem like it was a Noble Phantasm that excels in both offense and defense...however my Noble Phantasm is more..."[lr]::
23464::$$$message_0206_0083_0001$$$::Saber's face is indecipherable.::
23465::$$$message_0206_0084_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
23466::$$$message_0206_0084_0001$$$::I don't know what just happened.[lr]::
23467::$$$message_0206_0084_0002$$$::Saber doesn't look amused.::
23468::$$$message_0206_0085_0000$$$::"Saber? Did Tohsaka's say something that worries you?" [lr]::
23469::$$$message_0206_0085_0001$$$::"Eh? Oh, no. It is nothing...but I do believe it is inappropriate for a knight to ask another for their opinion of who is stronger."::
23470::$$$message_0206_0086_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
23471::$$$message_0206_0086_0001$$$::She's acting strange.[lr]::
23472::$$$message_0206_0086_0002$$$::Saber seems embarrassed by her own actions, and starts to mutter under her breath.::
23473::$$$message_0206_0087_0000$$$::"Well, whatever. By the way, I thought I heard you say something weird. Something about Saber and Lancer being anti-personnel or something."::
23474::$$$message_0206_0088_0000$$$::"Do you mean an anti-personnel Noble Phantasm? Well, it is what the word suggests. My Invisible Air and Lancer's G치e Bolg are armaments that are strictly used to defeat people.[lr]::
23475::$$$message_0206_0088_0001$$$::No matter how powerful the magical energy or curse it may possess, it cannot be used against something else."::
23476::$$$message_0206_0089_0000$$$::...Well, I guess that makes sense.[lr]::
23477::$$$message_0206_0089_0001$$$::Saber's invisible sword is definitely useful in battle.::
23478::$$$message_0206_0090_0000$$$::But that's only effective against people. [lr]::
23479::$$$message_0206_0090_0001$$$::If you chopped firewood with Saber's sword, whether you can see the blade or not isn't going to affect how quickly you can chop wood.[lr]::
23480::$$$message_0206_0090_0002$$$::It's the same with Lancer's G치e Bolg. [lr]::
23481::$$$message_0206_0090_0003$$$::Even a cursed spear that always strikes the heart is just a sharp spear if you use it against a boulder or a house.::
23482::$$$message_0206_0091_0000$$$::"I see. So that's why it's called an anti-personnel Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
23483::$$$message_0206_0091_0001$$$::Which means Rider's Noble Phantasm is..."::
23484::$$$message_0206_0092_0000$$$::"It would be an anti-army Noble Phantasm. Actually, I heard from Father about this once; certain Noble Phantasms are designated anti-personnel, and others as anti-army."::
23485::$$$message_0206_0093_0000$$$::"The simple way to understand it is this: an anti-personnel Noble Phantasm is like a gun with unlimited ammo, but an anti-army Noble Phantasm is like a missile you can only launch once.[lr]::
23486::$$$message_0206_0093_0001$$$::Rider's Noble Phantasm may be powerful, but it probably has limited uses. At the very least, it doesn't generate a continuous effect like Saber's sword being invisible."::
23487::$$$message_0206_0094_0000$$$::"What?"[lr]::
23488::$$$message_0206_0094_0001$$$::Hold on a minute.[lr]::
23489::$$$message_0206_0094_0002$$$::A gun versus a missile... There's no contest.[lr]::
23490::$$$message_0206_0094_0003$$$::Sure, Saber's invisible sword is awesome, but if she goes up against a ridiculous Noble Phantasm like that, she'll be dead before she can even swing her sword...::
23491::$$$message_0206_0095_0000$$$::"So you're saying that if we're going to fight Rider, we need to defeat her before she deploys her Noble Phantasm."::
23492::$$$message_0206_0096_0000$$$::"Most likely. You've got no chance if it becomes a battle of Noble Phantasms.[lr]::
23493::$$$message_0206_0096_0001$$$::If you're going to find Rider and Shinji, you should at least keep that in mind.[lr]::
23494::$$$message_0206_0096_0002$$$::The biggest requirement is for you to defeat Rider before she deploys her Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
23495::$$$message_0206_0096_0003$$$::The longer you draw out the fight, the more of a disadvantage you'll be at."::
23496::$$$message_0206_0097_0000$$$::"Or you can defeat Rider's Master while I battle Rider. He is not able to fight, so that might be the better plan."::
23497::$$$message_0206_0098_0000$$$::So that's what we've come up with.[lr]::
23498::$$$message_0206_0098_0001$$$::Since we have no strategy to deal with Rider's Noble Phantasm, we just need to defeat Rider before she uses it.[lr]::
23499::$$$message_0206_0098_0002$$$::Whatever Noble Phantasms other Servants have, we still don't want to have to deal with Rider's.::
23500::$$$message_0206_0099_0000$$$::"Thanks for the warning, Tohsaka.[lr]::
23501::$$$message_0206_0099_0001$$$::We're going to go find Shinji, but what do you want to do, Tohsaka? Will you stay and watch the house?"::
23502::$$$message_0206_0100_0000$$$::"Well, if you'd insisted, we could've come with you to look for Shinji. But, I'll pass."[lr]::
23503::$$$message_0206_0100_0001$$$::Rider isn't the only enemy. We can't forget that we teamed up initially to beat Berserker.[lr]::
23504::$$$message_0206_0100_0002$$$::So while you're out pursuing Shinji, I have something else to do."::
23505::$$$message_0206_0101_0000$$$::Tohsaka stands up with a frosty smile.[lr]::
23506::$$$message_0206_0101_0001$$$::"See you. I look forward to hearing some good news."::
