7353::$$$message_0070_0000_0000$$$::I'm having that dream.[lr]::
7354::$$$message_0070_0000_0001$$$::Maybe this is what death looks like to me.[lr]::
7355::$$$message_0070_0000_0002$$$::The closer I get to death, the more I keep seeing these images I don't want to see.::
7356::$$$message_0070_0001_0000$$$::I see motionless bodies, crumbling and disappearing.[lr]::
7357::$$$message_0070_0001_0001$$$::That moment when everyone desperately sought help, but none came.[lr]::
7358::$$$message_0070_0001_0002$$$::That was painful.[lr]::
7359::$$$message_0070_0001_0003$$$::It was so terrible, it hurt even to live, and I thought maybe just disappearing would put me out of my misery.::
7360::$$$message_0070_0002_0000$$$::Dazed, I reached my hand out.[lr]::
7361::$$$message_0070_0002_0001$$$::...But not because I wanted help.[lr]::
7362::$$$message_0070_0002_0002$$$::I just thought the sky was so far away.[lr]::
7363::$$$message_0070_0002_0003$$$::That was my final thought, I think.::
7364::$$$message_0070_0003_0000$$$::And then I lost consciousness, and my outstretched hand fell to the ground.[lr]::
7365::$$$message_0070_0003_0001$$$::Or rather...[lr]::
7366::$$$message_0070_0003_0002$$$::It should have.::
7367::$$$message_0070_0004_0000$$$::A large hand grasps the smaller one as it falls.[lr]::
7368::$$$message_0070_0004_0001$$$::He rushed into the fire to save somebody, and found me.::
7369::$$$message_0070_0005_0000$$$::...I remember that face.[lr]::
7370::$$$message_0070_0005_0001$$$::I remember the tears pooling in his eyes, how overjoyed he was to have found a living human being.[lr]::
7371::$$$message_0070_0005_0002$$$::   He looked so happy.[lr]::
7372::$$$message_0070_0005_0003$$$::It seemed almost like he was the one being saved, not me.::
7373::$$$message_0070_0006_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
7374::$$$message_0070_0006_0001$$$::He actually looked envious of me, who was on the brink of death...he even looked grateful for something as he rescued the strange child.::
7375::$$$message_0070_0007_0000$$$::   It was a turning point in my life.[lr]::
7376::$$$message_0070_0007_0001$$$::The weakness I showed in accepting death became a strength, a desire to live.[lr]::
7377::$$$message_0070_0007_0002$$$::My mind, which had practically gone blank, was filled with the joy of being saved in that moment.[lr]::
7378::$$$message_0070_0007_0003$$$::I tried moving my fingers with what strength I had left so as not to let go of the man's hand, and then I finally passed out.::
7379::$$$message_0070_0008_0000$$$::The next thing I knew, I was in the hospital, and the man who saved me had come to visit.::
7380::$$$message_0070_0009_0000$$$::That was ten years ago.[lr]::
7381::$$$message_0070_0009_0001$$$::From then on, all I ever did was follow in Kiritsugu's footsteps.[lr]::
7382::$$$message_0070_0009_0002$$$::The only thing I could think of was being like him.[lr]::
7383::$$$message_0070_0009_0003$$$::It's not because he saved me.[lr]::
7384::$$$message_0070_0009_0004$$$::I couldn't shake off the image of his face back then, and I tried to become the same thing.[lr]::
7385::$$$message_0070_0009_0005$$$::I've been striving for that ever since.[lr]::
7386::$$$message_0070_0009_0006$$$::Somewhere in the back of my mind, I dreamed I wouldn't notice.::
7387::$$$message_0070_0010_0000$$$::That's right...that I would one day...[lr]::
7388::$$$message_0070_0010_0001$$$::I held to the hope...the dream that one day I, too, would be saved if I could smile like Kiritsugu did back then...::
7389::$$$message_0070_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
7390::$$$message_0070_0011_0001$$$::When I open my eyes, I'm in my living room.[lr]::
7391::$$$message_0070_0011_0002$$$::The ticking of the clock is awfully loud.[lr]::
7392::$$$message_0070_0011_0003$$$::It looks like I've been sleeping on the floor, and when I raise my arms, I notice the bandages wrapped tightly around both of them.::
7393::$$$message_0070_0012_0000$$$::"...It's dark out."[lr]::
7394::$$$message_0070_0012_0001$$$::I sit up.[lr]::
7395::$$$message_0070_0012_0002$$$::According to the clock, it's ten at night.::
7396::$$$message_0070_0013_0000$$$::"Don't just say 'it's dark out' like nothing happened, you ingrate. Can't you think of something better to say the moment you wake up?"[lr]::
7397::$$$message_0070_0013_0001$$$::"Tohsaka. You're here."::
7398::$$$message_0070_0014_0000$$$::"No, that's not it either.[lr]::
7399::$$$message_0070_0014_0001$$$::Is that the attitude you should be taking when I've been at your side, nursing you this whole time?"[lr]::
7400::$$$message_0070_0014_0002$$$::...I didn't know that.[lr]::
7401::$$$message_0070_0014_0003$$$::That's ungrateful of me.::
7402::$$$message_0070_0015_0000$$$::"Sorry. My brain's a little wonky. I can't really think straight, but...thanks. Guess I owe you one. Again."::
7403::$$$message_0070_0016_0000$$$::"Well, it was nothing. You were in pretty bad shape, so I don't blame you for still being a little hazy."::
7404::$$$message_0070_0017_0000$$$::"So...does anything hurt? I think all your external injuries have healed up, but I don't know about anything internal. If there's anything wrong still, we need to treat it."::
7405::$$$message_0070_0018_0000$$$::"No, I just feel dull. Nothing's hurting.[lr]::
7406::$$$message_0070_0018_0001$$$::It's just that..."::
7407::$$$message_0070_0019_0000$$$::I feel like I'm floating.[lr]::
7408::$$$message_0070_0019_0001$$$::I don't know how I ended up here.[lr]::
7409::$$$message_0070_0019_0002$$$::I don't remember what I did toda[line2]::
7410::$$$message_0070_0020_0000$$$::"Oh right! Tohsaka! How's the school!? What happened to me after that...!?"::
7411::$$$message_0070_0021_0000$$$::"It's okay, don't worry about the others. Kirei went to follow up at the school.[lr]::
7412::$$$message_0070_0021_0001$$$::He'll handle all the repairs for the hallway and everything else, so you don't have to worry about any of that. He's a priest, so he should do that much or risk the wrath of God."::
7413::$$$message_0070_0022_0000$$$::"He's doing that? So that means the school's..."[lr]::
7414::$$$message_0070_0022_0001$$$::"It didn't become a major crisis. A lot of students were taken to the hospital, but none of their conditions seemed to be life-threatening. They're being treated for malnutrition, and most will only have to spend two or three days at the hospital."::
7415::$$$message_0070_0023_0000$$$::"Okay, that's..."[lr]::
7416::$$$message_0070_0023_0001$$$::That's a relief.[lr]::
7417::$$$message_0070_0023_0002$$$::Dissolving the Bounded Field took longer than expected, but I wasn't too late.::
7418::$$$message_0070_0024_0000$$$::The instant I relax, every last bit of strength floods out of me.[lr]::
7419::$$$message_0070_0024_0001$$$::I breathe out deeply, and I lean back against the wall.::
7420::$$$message_0070_0025_0000$$$::"Does that mean Kotomine healed me too?[lr]::
7421::$$$message_0070_0025_0001$$$::I don't think even you would be able to heal so many wounds."::
7422::$$$message_0070_0026_0000$$$::"What are you talking about? You healed them yourself.[lr]::
7423::$$$message_0070_0026_0001$$$::It was the same as the thing with Berserker. The way you heal your wounds is nearly miraculous... You really don't remember?"::
7424::$$$message_0070_0027_0000$$$::"No. I don't know why myself. I was normal until I formed a contract with Saber."::
7425::$$$message_0070_0028_0000$$$::"Is that so? Maybe you're just descended from lizards or something?"[lr]::
7426::$$$message_0070_0028_0001$$$::"How can you say something like that with a straight face? This is weird for me too, you know. It's like my body isn't my own."::
7427::$$$message_0070_0029_0000$$$::"I think it's fine. Whatever the cause, your condition is why you survived.[lr]::
7428::$$$message_0070_0029_0001$$$::That's twice now. Turning into a lizard would be a fair compromise at this point."[lr]::
7429::$$$message_0070_0029_0002$$$::"Are you enjoying teasing the critically injured guy, Tohsaka?"::
7430::$$$message_0070_0030_0000$$$::"You WERE critically injured.[lr]::
7431::$$$message_0070_0030_0001$$$::Well, anyway. You should thank Saber too. I'm not sure how or why, but it's all thanks to Saber that you're like this."::
7432::$$$message_0070_0031_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
7433::$$$message_0070_0031_0001$$$::My brain finally starts working.[lr]::
7434::$$$message_0070_0031_0002$$$::There's something I need to do.[lr]::
7435::$$$message_0070_0031_0003$$$::I needed her, I called her...so she came, and she saved me. I need to tell her something right away.::
7436::$$$message_0070_0032_0000$$$::"Kngh...!"[lr]::
7437::$$$message_0070_0032_0001$$$::I stand up too quickly.[lr]::
7438::$$$message_0070_0032_0002$$$::Pain shoots through my body as I move, but I can't let that stop me.::
7439::$$$message_0070_0033_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, where's Saber?"[lr]::
7440::$$$message_0070_0033_0001$$$::"She's in the dojo. I'm going to go get something from my room."[lr]::
7441::$$$message_0070_0033_0002$$$::Tohsaka heads over to the outbuilding.::
7442::$$$message_0070_0034_0000$$$::"Ouch..."[lr]::
7443::$$$message_0070_0034_0001$$$::My joints creak with pain.[lr]::
7444::$$$message_0070_0034_0002$$$::I grit my teeth and try to endure it as I head toward the dojo.::
7445::$$$message_0070_0035_0000$$$::I reach the dojo.[lr]::
7446::$$$message_0070_0035_0001$$$::Saber is sitting in seiza style, as if she's meditating.::
7447::$$$message_0070_0036_0000$$$::"Shirou? You've woken!?"[lr]::
7448::$$$message_0070_0036_0001$$$::Saber notices me coming in and hurries to her feet then rushes over to me.::
7449::$$$message_0070_0037_0000$$$::"Sorry for worrying you. I only just came to. And Saber..."::
7450::$$$message_0070_0038_0000$$$::"Do not dare 'sorry' me now! There are many things I must say to you...! You accepted an invitation from the enemy and left me, you tried to fight on your own, and you did not spare an ounce of consideration for your body!"::
7451::$$$message_0070_0039_0000$$$::"Do you understand that any [font italic=true]one[font italic=false] of those foolish decisions could have been fatal!? You very nearly [font italic=true]did[font italic=false] die! Do you enjoy tormenting me like this!?"::
7452::$$$message_0070_0040_0000$$$::"Ah...no, I..."[lr]::
7453::$$$message_0070_0040_0001$$$::"What is it!? I will not be moved by any facile excuses you might attempt to make for yourself![lr]::
7454::$$$message_0070_0040_0002$$$::Today is the day I will hear precisely what is on that mind of yours!"::
7455::$$$message_0070_0041_0000$$$::Saber comes at me with all the rage and force of a hurricane.[lr]::
7456::$$$message_0070_0041_0001$$$::She's so intense. I'm not sure how to explain it, but I'm kind of enjoying Saber being so emotional.::
7457::$$$message_0070_0042_0000$$$::"I know. Let me explain myself.[lr]::
7458::$$$message_0070_0042_0001$$$::Let's talk, Saber. As you can see, I've healed."::
7459::$$$message_0070_0043_0000$$$::"Eh...Shirou, are you all right?"[lr]::
7460::$$$message_0070_0043_0001$$$::"Yeah, looks like it. I'm alive for now."[lr]::
7461::$$$message_0070_0043_0002$$$::"I see... That is a relief."::
7462::$$$message_0070_0044_0000$$$::Where'd that angry look from a few seconds ago go?[lr]::
7463::$$$message_0070_0044_0001$$$::Saber heaves a relieved sigh and smiles softly as if celebrating my recovery.::
7464::$$$message_0070_0045_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
7465::$$$message_0070_0045_0001$$$::It helps me understand that even Saber, stoic as she always is, is acting like this because of how much I worried her.[lr]::
7466::$$$message_0070_0045_0002$$$::I wasn't relying on Saber.[lr]::
7467::$$$message_0070_0045_0003$$$::But she still accepted me as someone to fight alongside.::
7468::$$$message_0070_0046_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
7469::$$$message_0070_0046_0001$$$::How stupid of me.[lr]::
7470::$$$message_0070_0046_0002$$$::I hadn't realized the extent to which she trusted me.[lr]::
7471::$$$message_0070_0046_0003$$$::And I couldn't extend the most basic trust of just [font italic=true]letting her fight[font italic=false].::
7472::$$$message_0070_0047_0000$$$::"Saber."[lr]::
7473::$$$message_0070_0047_0001$$$::I speak up more comfortably now.[lr]::
7474::$$$message_0070_0047_0002$$$::I'm finally able to look her in the eye, and it feels natural.::
7475::$$$message_0070_0048_0000$$$::"Yes? What is it, Shirou?"[lr]::
7476::$$$message_0070_0048_0001$$$::"Sorry. I was an idiot."[lr]::
7477::$$$message_0070_0048_0002$$$::I bow my head.::
7478::$$$message_0070_0049_0000$$$::"What? Please lift your head, Shirou. I was only employing a figure of speech earlier. Yes, I was angry, but there is no call for you to apologize[line2]"[lr]::
7479::$$$message_0070_0049_0001$$$::"Of course I do. I'm your partner, and I owe you an apology.[lr]::
7480::$$$message_0070_0049_0002$$$::I'm sorry I worried you. As long as I'm with you, I'll never fight alone."::
7481::$$$message_0070_0050_0000$$$::"Shirou, are you..."[lr]::
7482::$$$message_0070_0050_0001$$$::"Yeah. Saber...please lend me your strength.[lr]::
7483::$$$message_0070_0050_0002$$$::I can't beat the other Masters on my own. I need your help."::
7484::$$$message_0070_0051_0000$$$::"Are you admitting that you were mistaken earlier? Are you accepting that, as a Master, you will devote yourself to a support role, and will leave the fighting to me from now on?"[lr]::
7485::$$$message_0070_0051_0001$$$::"..."::
7486::$$$message_0070_0052_0000$$$::Well, I still don't want to see Saber hurt.[lr]::
7487::$$$message_0070_0052_0001$$$::That's why I forbid her from fighting.[lr]::
7488::$$$message_0070_0052_0002$$$::And that's where I was wrong.[lr]::
7489::$$$message_0070_0052_0003$$$::Ever since I decided to fight with her, I should've just put everything I had into helping her.::
7490::$$$message_0070_0053_0000$$$::"No, I don't think I was mistaken.[lr]::
7491::$$$message_0070_0053_0001$$$::If you're going to protect me, I'm going to protect you. I can't let you fight alone."[lr]::
7492::$$$message_0070_0053_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
7493::$$$message_0070_0053_0003$$$::Saber doesn't answer.[lr]::
7494::$$$message_0070_0053_0004$$$::The mood in the dojo turns frosty.::
7495::$$$message_0070_0054_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
7496::$$$message_0070_0054_0001$$$::I just can't let this go.[lr]::
7497::$$$message_0070_0054_0002$$$::I lift my head, thinking I'll just have to beg until she accepts my determination.::
7498::$$$message_0070_0055_0000$$$::But then...[lr]::
7499::$$$message_0070_0055_0001$$$::"...You are too stubborn to change, aren't you?"[lr]::
7500::$$$message_0070_0055_0002$$$::"Eh? Um...Saber?"::
7501::$$$message_0070_0056_0000$$$::"There is no need to respond, is there?[lr]::
7502::$$$message_0070_0056_0001$$$::I am your blade. Who but I can be the one to help you, Shirou?"[lr]::
7503::$$$message_0070_0056_0002$$$::Saber extends her left hand.::
7504::$$$message_0070_0057_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
7505::$$$message_0070_0057_0001$$$::I can't think of anything sensible to say, so I shake her hand.[lr]::
7506::$$$message_0070_0057_0002$$$::Our handshake forms something almost tangible.[lr]::
7507::$$$message_0070_0057_0003$$$::It's been a few days since we first met, but it feels like we finally formed a real contract.::
7508::$$$message_0070_0058_0000$$$::"What's going on? Why are you two shaking hands?"[lr]::
7509::$$$message_0070_0058_0001$$$::Hey.[lr]::
7510::$$$message_0070_0058_0002$$$::Why would she show up now, of all times!?::
7511::$$$message_0070_0059_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
7512::$$$message_0070_0059_0001$$$::Saber and I quickly let go of each other's hands.[lr]::
7513::$$$message_0070_0059_0002$$$::"Huh? Something's fishy. You two weren't hatching some kind of scheme without me, were you?"::
7514::$$$message_0070_0060_0000$$$::"No, absolutely not. I was...ah...making sure Master is in good health before checking his pulse."[lr]::
7515::$$$message_0070_0060_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
7516::$$$message_0070_0060_0002$$$::I'm dumbfounded.[lr]::
7517::$$$message_0070_0060_0003$$$::Saber just told a bald-faced lie.[lr]::
7518::$$$message_0070_0060_0004$$$::But...why would Saber panic about this too?::
7519::$$$message_0070_0061_0000$$$::"Yeah? You've got a weird way of checking someone's pulse."[lr]::
7520::$$$message_0070_0061_0001$$$::Tohsaka regards Saber curiously.[lr]::
7521::$$$message_0070_0061_0002$$$::In response, Saber starts acting even more suspiciously, probably because she's not used to lying.[lr]::
7522::$$$message_0070_0061_0003$$$::I need to help her, or this will get even more awkward.::
7523::$$$message_0070_0062_0000$$$::"Hey. What do you want, Tohsaka? Didn't you say you were getting something from your room?"[lr]::
7524::$$$message_0070_0062_0001$$$::"Oh yeah. Here, Saber."[lr]::
7525::$$$message_0070_0062_0002$$$::"Thank you. I thank you for your trouble, Rin."::
7526::$$$message_0070_0063_0000$$$::Tohsaka hands Saber a bag.[lr]::
7527::$$$message_0070_0063_0001$$$::Saber looks surprisingly happy as she takes the bag.::
7528::$$$message_0070_0064_0000$$$::"That's the last of it, so be careful. Forced summoning or not, changing into your armor will shred your clothes to bits."[lr]::
7529::$$$message_0070_0064_0001$$$::"I am sorry. It was so sudden, that I did not think ahead. I appreciate you bringing me more of the same clothing."::
7530::$$$message_0070_0065_0000$$$::"Yeah. It's a simple design, so it's like a uniform.[lr]::
7531::$$$message_0070_0065_0001$$$::Kirei keeps forcing such plain clothes on me. Not that I mind, since that outfit doesn't look very good on me. But...why are you so fixated on this outfit, Saber?"::
7532::$$$message_0070_0066_0000$$$::"Well, Shirou mentioned that it looked good on me."::
7533::$$$message_0070_0067_0000$$$::I'm not following all of this, but it seems that's Saber's third set of clothes.[lr]::
7534::$$$message_0070_0067_0001$$$::I don't have any women's clothing around the house, so Saber's been borrowing clothes from Tohsaka.::
7535::$$$message_0070_0068_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
7536::$$$message_0070_0068_0001$$$::But, yeah...[lr]::
7537::$$$message_0070_0068_0002$$$::I'd really appreciate it if they had their girl talk when I'm not around.[lr]::
7538::$$$message_0070_0068_0003$$$::I [font italic=true]am[font italic=false] a guy...[lr]::
7539::$$$message_0070_0068_0004$$$::It had been such a nice conversation until now too, but I don't really know what to do with myself when they get to talking about stuff like this.::
7540::$$$message_0070_0069_0000$$$::So not much happened afterward, and both Tohsaka and Saber forced me to go sleep in my room.::
7541::$$$message_0070_0070_0000$$$::I may have regained consciousness, but I'm still severely injured.[lr]::
7542::$$$message_0070_0070_0001$$$::Rider sliced my arms up so bad that under normal circumstances, I'd have had to worry about whether I'd ever be able to use them again. Plus, I fell three stories, so I'm all broken and bruised.[lr]::
7543::$$$message_0070_0070_0002$$$::There's plenty I should be thinking about, but the two have agreed that the best thing for me to do right now is sleep so I can heal.::
7544::$$$message_0070_0071_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
7545::$$$message_0070_0071_0001$$$::But I let Shinji get away, and I'll need to settle things with him as quickly as possible.[lr]::
7546::$$$message_0070_0071_0002$$$::He didn't hesitate to activate the Bounded Field.[lr]::
7547::$$$message_0070_0071_0003$$$::Even I know how dangerous it'd be to let a Master like that roam free.::
7548::$$$message_0070_0072_0000$$$::"Damn...this isn't the time for me to be sleep...ing..."[lr]::
7549::$$$message_0070_0072_0001$$$::Things go blank, like a dizzy spell sweeping over me.[lr]::
7550::$$$message_0070_0072_0002$$$::The only thing that feels normal is my head.[lr]::
7551::$$$message_0070_0072_0003$$$::As soon as I lay down, my half-healed body just forces me off to sleep.::
7552::$$$message_0070_0073_0000$$$::"...Tomorrow...when tomorrow comes..."[lr]::
7553::$$$message_0070_0073_0001$$$::I don't have time to rest like this.[lr]::
7554::$$$message_0070_0073_0002$$$::Even if my body isn't fully healed, I need to find Shinji...›‘Ÿ`
