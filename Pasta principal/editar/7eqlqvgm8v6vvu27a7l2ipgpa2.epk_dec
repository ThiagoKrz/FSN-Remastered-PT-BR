17856::$$$message_0167_0000_0000$$$::And so the day ends.[lr]::
17857::$$$message_0167_0000_0001$$$::Dinner was chaotic.[lr]::
17858::$$$message_0167_0000_0002$$$::Illya got chattier with each meal, and she and Tohsaka have gotten to this weird point where I'm not sure whether they're fighting or being friendly.::
17859::$$$message_0167_0001_0000$$$::Saber has accepted Illya's presence here, but she hasn't warmed up to her. More than that, Saber gets pretty frowny whenever Illya gets near me.::
17860::$$$message_0167_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
17861::$$$message_0167_0002_0001$$$::These past few days have been just plain rough.[lr]::
17862::$$$message_0167_0002_0002$$$::The normal routine of just a few days ago has devolved into complete chaos.::
17863::$$$message_0167_0003_0000$$$::I step silently out into the yard.[lr]::
17864::$$$message_0167_0003_0001$$$::It's just about time for the calendar to roll over to the next day.[lr]::
17865::$$$message_0167_0003_0002$$$::I walk beneath the pale light of the moon, leaving faint puffs of white breath in my wake.::
17866::$$$message_0167_0004_0000$$$::Next thing I know, I'm at work on my daily routine.[lr]::
17867::$$$message_0167_0004_0001$$$::I don't really need to train out here since Tohsaka is teaching me.[lr]::
17868::$$$message_0167_0004_0002$$$::But I still sit on the cold ground and check on the things I've been working on for so long.::
17869::$$$message_0167_0005_0000$$$::I'm not doing this because I'm worried about my skills.[lr]::
17870::$$$message_0167_0005_0001$$$::It's more that I find doing it soothing.[lr]::
17871::$$$message_0167_0005_0002$$$::I've been doing this for years, so just not doing it would feel weird.::
17872::$$$message_0167_0006_0000$$$::"Trace, on."[lr]::
17873::$$$message_0167_0006_0001$$$::I put even more effort into tonight's training.[lr]::
17874::$$$message_0167_0006_0002$$$::Tohsaka told me not to do it anymore, but I can't just do as she says.[lr]::
17875::$$$message_0167_0006_0003$$$::If I can master this Projection thing, it'd mean I could be a lot more helpful to Saber.::
17876::$$$message_0167_0007_0000$$$::And the heat from earlier is still lingering within me.[lr]::
17877::$$$message_0167_0007_0001$$$::The night at the ruins.[lr]::
17878::$$$message_0167_0007_0002$$$::The battle in the forest in the morning mist.[lr]::
17879::$$$message_0167_0007_0003$$$::The golden sword I created.[lr]::
17880::$$$message_0167_0007_0004$$$::The residual heat still lingers in my hands, and deep down I find myself hoping I'll be able to reignite those flames.::
17881::$$$message_0167_0008_0000$$$::"Creation philosophy, appraisal."[lr]::
17882::$$$message_0167_0008_0001$$$::It's easy to recreate.[lr]::
17883::$$$message_0167_0008_0002$$$::At the time, I was so desperate that my mind was a jumble, but now I can retrace the necessary steps and form my incantation.::
17884::$$$message_0167_0009_0000$$$::   No.[lr]::
17885::$$$message_0167_0009_0001$$$::From the very beginning, there has only been a single thing that could serve as a trigger for me.[lr]::
17886::$$$message_0167_0009_0002$$$::The pronunciation is the same.[lr]::
17887::$$$message_0167_0009_0003$$$::But just by changing my perception of how it is said, it will become something entirely mine, my own original spell.::
17888::$$$message_0167_0010_0000$$$::"Basic structure, hypothesis."[lr]::
17889::$$$message_0167_0010_0001$$$::I know very well how dangerous this is. Tohsaka doesn't need to remind me.[lr]::
17890::$$$message_0167_0010_0002$$$::I really have no business getting anywhere near Projection magecraft.[lr]::
17891::$$$message_0167_0010_0003$$$::It's completely beyond me.[lr]::
17892::$$$message_0167_0010_0004$$$::Venturing so brazenly into dangerous waters can lead only to death.::
17893::$$$message_0167_0011_0000$$$::"End of hypothesis. Now, instant nothingness." [lr]::
17894::$$$message_0167_0011_0001$$$::I erase the blueprint that was in my head.[lr]::
17895::$$$message_0167_0011_0002$$$::A shadow falls across the door.[lr]::
17896::$$$message_0167_0011_0003$$$::Saber comes in, her frame blotting out the light of the moon.::
17897::$$$message_0167_0012_0000$$$::"Good. You are here, Shirou. I could not find you, and was worried something might have happened."[lr]::
17898::$$$message_0167_0012_0001$$$::"Huh? No, nothing's happened. I couldn't sleep, so I came here to do some mental exercises. Once I finish, I'll head back to my room, so you don't need to worry."::
17899::$$$message_0167_0013_0000$$$::"I see. That is fine, then."[lr]::
17900::$$$message_0167_0013_0001$$$::Saber focuses on my forehead.[lr]::
17901::$$$message_0167_0013_0002$$$::She can probably see that I'm dripping with sweat.::
17902::$$$message_0167_0014_0000$$$::"It's always like this. Don't worry.[lr]::
17903::$$$message_0167_0014_0001$$$::Mages have to practice their magecraft.[lr]::
17904::$$$message_0167_0014_0002$$$::...And, well, failure comes with the territory for an amateur like me."[lr]::
17905::$$$message_0167_0014_0003$$$::I wipe the sweat from my brow with the back of a hand.::
17906::$$$message_0167_0015_0000$$$::"Oh?"[lr]::
17907::$$$message_0167_0015_0001$$$::...I'm surprised.[lr]::
17908::$$$message_0167_0015_0002$$$::My sweat is cold as ice.[lr]::
17909::$$$message_0167_0015_0003$$$::I thought it was cold, but I don't remember the shed being quite [font italic=true]this[font italic=false] cold.::
17910::$$$message_0167_0016_0000$$$::"Shirou, have you been doing this every day?"[lr]::
17911::$$$message_0167_0016_0001$$$::"Well yeah, as much as I possibly could. It's a daily routine my old man taught me, so I should at least keep to it."::
17912::$$$message_0167_0017_0000$$$::As soon as I finish speaking, I regret my bluff.[lr]::
17913::$$$message_0167_0017_0001$$$::I regret telling her this is my daily routine.[lr]::
17914::$$$message_0167_0017_0002$$$::My intent was to boast to Saber.[lr]::
17915::$$$message_0167_0017_0003$$$::At the end of the day, my training isn't just some chore to me.[lr]::
17916::$$$message_0167_0017_0004$$$::But it isn't the easiest of tasks either.::
17917::$$$message_0167_0018_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
17918::$$$message_0167_0018_0001$$$::Saber says nothing.[lr]::
17919::$$$message_0167_0018_0002$$$::The moon hangs behind her, its light spilling around her frame.[lr]::
17920::$$$message_0167_0018_0003$$$::The shed, plunged into bluish darkness, is illuminated by the few shafts of silvery light that make it past Saber.[lr]::
17921::$$$message_0167_0018_0004$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
17922::$$$message_0167_0018_0005$$$::I recall the first night I met her.::
17923::$$$message_0167_0019_0000$$$::"Saber. Tohsaka said something to me today."[lr]::
17924::$$$message_0167_0019_0001$$$::That moment felt just like a dream...[lr]::
17925::$$$message_0167_0019_0002$$$::"Is it true that Servants don't dream?"[lr]::
17926::$$$message_0167_0019_0003$$$::I can't stop myself from asking.::
17927::$$$message_0167_0020_0000$$$::"That is correct. We do not have dreams. Servants are spiritual forms, and so do not sleep to begin with.[lr]::
17928::$$$message_0167_0020_0001$$$::I am forced to sleep because I cannot turn into spiritual form, but I still do not dream."[lr]::
17929::$$$message_0167_0020_0002$$$::"But, this morning, you said..."::
17930::$$$message_0167_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
17931::$$$message_0167_0021_0001$$$::There is a brief silence.[lr]::
17932::$$$message_0167_0021_0002$$$::She closes her eyes, then, apparently having made up her mind...::
17933::$$$message_0167_0022_0000$$$::"The dream I had, Shirou, was yours.[lr]::
17934::$$$message_0167_0022_0001$$$::Master and Servant are mentally connected. If the connection becomes strong enough, there are times when they will experience each other's memories."::
17935::$$$message_0167_0023_0000$$$::"You dreamed of...my past?"[lr]::
17936::$$$message_0167_0023_0001$$$::"Yes. It is tantamount to stepping into your mind, but I was not able to prevent it from happening.[lr]::
17937::$$$message_0167_0023_0002$$$::...Please forgive me for that, Shirou."::
17938::$$$message_0167_0024_0000$$$::"Don't..."[lr]::
17939::$$$message_0167_0024_0001$$$::I did the same thing.[lr]::
17940::$$$message_0167_0024_0002$$$::Saber's past.[lr]::
17941::$$$message_0167_0024_0003$$$::I've seen several scenes from her life before she became a Servant now.::
17942::$$$message_0167_0025_0000$$$::"Don't be silly. That's not your fault. You can't help what you dream about.[lr]::
17943::$$$message_0167_0025_0001$$$::And I have to apologize too.[lr]::
17944::$$$message_0167_0025_0002$$$::My past is pretty boring. Seeing something that boring probably makes you not want to have to sleep."::
17945::$$$message_0167_0026_0000$$$::"No. This morning was the first such dream I had. I did not see anything recent, so I did not infringe on your privacy as a young man!"::
17946::$$$message_0167_0027_0000$$$::Saber is dead serious about that warning.[lr]::
17947::$$$message_0167_0027_0001$$$::But privacy? Well, yeah sure, I've done my share of dumb things...::
17948::$$$message_0167_0028_0000$$$::"That's a relief. But if you're saying you didn't see any recent memories, then how far into the past did you see?"::
17949::$$$message_0167_0029_0000$$$::"There was a large fire. That is all I saw."[lr]::
17950::$$$message_0167_0029_0001$$$::Her voice is quiet.[lr]::
17951::$$$message_0167_0029_0002$$$::Her gentle gaze tells me what she saw.::
17952::$$$message_0167_0030_0000$$$::Oh.[lr]::
17953::$$$message_0167_0030_0001$$$::[font italic=true]That[font italic=false] dream.::
17954::$$$message_0167_0031_0000$$$::"I see. Well, I don't know what to say..."[lr]::
17955::$$$message_0167_0031_0001$$$::Should I say it was "unfortunate"?[lr]::
17956::$$$message_0167_0031_0002$$$::It's like...going to a movie theater expecting to see a movie you know, but you somehow end up in the wrong theater and end up getting a completely different show.::
17957::$$$message_0167_0032_0000$$$::"It helped me to understand. No... I have been thinking this for some time now, but you have a dangerous side to you."[lr]::
17958::$$$message_0167_0032_0001$$$::"Huh? What do you mean, dangerous? Well, yeah, I'm sure the odds are plenty stacked against me, from your point of view."::
17959::$$$message_0167_0033_0000$$$::"That is not what I mean.[lr]::
17960::$$$message_0167_0033_0001$$$::You are very similar to me. That is why I understand your mistakes. I can see what might happen to you if you continue on this path."::
17961::$$$message_0167_0034_0000$$$::"Uh, I don't think I've made any mistakes.[lr]::
17962::$$$message_0167_0034_0001$$$::Sure, I've failed plenty of times, but my goal is to be a champion of justice like my old man. A goal like that? Can't be a mistake. No way."::
17963::$$$message_0167_0035_0000$$$::"I am telling you that [font italic=true]is[font italic=false] your mistake.[lr]::
17964::$$$message_0167_0035_0001$$$::Shirou. What happened on that day was not your fault. You cannot and should not take responsibility for it.[lr]::
17965::$$$message_0167_0035_0002$$$::There is nothing you need redeem yourself for."::
17966::$$$message_0167_0036_0000$$$::That's obvious.[lr]::
17967::$$$message_0167_0036_0001$$$::It was just an accident, and I was just a victim.[lr]::
17968::$$$message_0167_0036_0002$$$::Sure, I may be dealing with survivor's guilt...::
17969::$$$message_0167_0037_0000$$$::"Rin once said that your self-sacrifice and devotion are bizarre. And I agree.[lr]::
17970::$$$message_0167_0037_0001$$$::You are not sacrificing your life to save others.[lr]::
17971::$$$message_0167_0037_0002$$$::In fact, at no point did you even consider your own life.::
17972::$$$message_0167_0038_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
17973::$$$message_0167_0038_0001$$$::Maybe my pupils have dilated.[lr]::
17974::$$$message_0167_0038_0002$$$::I'm not sure why, but I can't seem to focus on Saber's face.::
17975::$$$message_0167_0039_0000$$$::"You will never be able to forget that accident. But as long as you remember it, you cannot change. Is that not extremely painful for you?"[lr]::
17976::$$$message_0167_0039_0001$$$::"Painful? For me?"::
17977::$$$message_0167_0040_0000$$$::Well yeah, that's painful.[lr]::
17978::$$$message_0167_0040_0001$$$::Saber doesn't have to remind me of that.[lr]::
17979::$$$message_0167_0040_0002$$$::It is obvious.[lr]::
17980::$$$message_0167_0040_0003$$$::So many people died. It was absolute hell.[lr]::
17981::$$$message_0167_0040_0004$$$::Something like that causing you pain is only natural.[lr]::
17982::$$$message_0167_0040_0005$$$::And besides, if I didn't feel that...[lr]::
17983::$$$message_0167_0040_0006$$$::It might all be meaningless.::
17984::$$$message_0167_0041_0000$$$::"Yeah. You're right. It is painful to remember.[lr]::
17985::$$$message_0167_0041_0001$$$::But it's in the past now. There's nothing I can do about it."[lr]::
17986::$$$message_0167_0041_0002$$$::Saber doesn't answer.[lr]::
17987::$$$message_0167_0041_0003$$$::Instead, she claws at her arm in frustration.::
17988::$$$message_0167_0042_0000$$$::"...I must obtain the Holy Grail.[lr]::
17989::$$$message_0167_0042_0001$$$::But that also applies to you, Shirou."[lr]::
17990::$$$message_0167_0042_0002$$$::"Eh? Saber..."::
17991::$$$message_0167_0043_0000$$$::"You require the Holy Grail.[lr]::
17992::$$$message_0167_0043_0001$$$::You summoning me was ultimately inevitable, Master."::
17993::$$$message_0167_0044_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
17994::$$$message_0167_0044_0001$$$::I don't know how to respond to that.[lr]::
17995::$$$message_0167_0044_0002$$$::"...I am going to go to bed. Please do not strain yourself overmuch."[lr]::
17996::$$$message_0167_0044_0003$$$::Saber leaves.::
17997::$$$message_0167_0045_0000$$$::"...Mhm."[lr]::
17998::$$$message_0167_0045_0001$$$::I fold my arms and think.[lr]::
17999::$$$message_0167_0045_0002$$$::Do I need the Holy Grail?[lr]::
18000::$$$message_0167_0045_0003$$$::A vessel that grants wishes to its possessor.[lr]::
18001::$$$message_0167_0045_0004$$$::A vessel which contains unlimited quantities of magical energy...for which it is said nothing is impossible.[lr]::
18002::$$$message_0167_0045_0005$$$::Were I to get it, it could easily grant my wish...::
18003::$$$message_0167_0046_0000$$$::"No, that's wrong. No matter how I look at it, I don't need the Holy Grail."[lr]::
18004::$$$message_0167_0046_0001$$$::Nope. I definitely don't need it.[lr]::
18005::$$$message_0167_0046_0002$$$::Because I don't have any wishes that can't come true, or hope for anything that's impossible.[lr]::
18006::$$$message_0167_0046_0003$$$::I wouldn't have a dream if it weren't something I could attain myself.::
18007::$$$message_0167_0047_0000$$$::The night grows darker.[lr]::
18008::$$$message_0167_0047_0001$$$::In the familiar old shed, lit only by the moon, I listen to the distant wind.::
