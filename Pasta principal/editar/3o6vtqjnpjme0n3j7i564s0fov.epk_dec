59227::$$$message_0536_0000_0001$$$::...No.[lr]::
59228::$$$message_0536_0000_0002$$$::I can't make any careless moves.[lr]::
59229::$$$message_0536_0000_0003$$$::I'm worried about Saber. I want to run to her right now and make sure she's okay.::
59230::$$$message_0536_0001_0000$$$::But that would mean turning my back on Zouken.[lr]::
59231::$$$message_0536_0001_0001$$$::That would be a fatal mistake.[lr]::
59232::$$$message_0536_0001_0002$$$::   [font italic=true]Defend yourself, Shirou.[font italic=false][lr]::
59233::$$$message_0536_0001_0003$$$::That's what Saber told me.[lr]::
59234::$$$message_0536_0001_0004$$$::Then, I need to hold out here until the last possible second.::
59235::$$$message_0536_0002_0000$$$::"...Oh? I see, I see. You have a strong bond to her."[lr]::
59236::$$$message_0536_0002_0001$$$::...I won't let Zouken's words sway me.[lr]::
59237::$$$message_0536_0002_0002$$$::I get a good grip on the kyousaku stick and tense up, ready to respond to any attack.::
59238::$$$message_0536_0003_0000$$$::"Very well, let us have a contest of endurance. You can wait and see whether you made the right choice."[lr]::
59239::$$$message_0536_0003_0001$$$::Zouken's murderous intent vanishes.[lr]::
59240::$$$message_0536_0003_0002$$$::The old mage takes a step back, melting into the wall of insects.::
59241::$$$message_0536_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59242::$$$message_0536_0004_0001$$$::His presence fades.[lr]::
59243::$$$message_0536_0004_0002$$$::I stare into the shadows, where he should be.[lr]::
59244::$$$message_0536_0004_0003$$$::...[lr]::
59245::$$$message_0536_0004_0004$$$::......[lr]::
59246::$$$message_0536_0004_0005$$$::.........[lr]::
59247::$$$message_0536_0004_0006$$$::............[lr]::
59248::$$$message_0536_0004_0007$$$::...............A full minute passes.::
59249::$$$message_0536_0005_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
59250::$$$message_0536_0005_0001$$$::I hear wind howl from afar, and then my left hand throbs with pain.[lr]::
59251::$$$message_0536_0005_0002$$$::The back of my hand is tingling.[lr]::
59252::$$$message_0536_0005_0003$$$::It hurts where the Command Spells are, almost like I'm bleeding there.::
59253::$$$message_0536_0006_0000$$$::"Saber...?"[lr]::
59254::$$$message_0536_0006_0001$$$::I feel awful dread.[lr]::
59255::$$$message_0536_0006_0002$$$::I feel awful dread.[lr]::
59256::$$$message_0536_0006_0003$$$::I feel awful dread.[lr]::
59257::$$$message_0536_0006_0004$$$::The pain in my left hand.[lr]::
59258::$$$message_0536_0006_0005$$$::The howling wind, gone silent.[lr]::
59259::$$$message_0536_0006_0006$$$::I hear the old mage chuckle from within the mass of hostile bugs.::
59260::$$$message_0536_0007_0000$$$::"Looks like it's all taken care of. If you're her Master, you should be able to tell that your Servant is gone from this world!"::
59261::$$$message_0536_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
59262::$$$message_0536_0008_0001$$$::My mind is paralyzed.[lr]::
59263::$$$message_0536_0008_0002$$$::My vision freezes.[lr]::
59264::$$$message_0536_0008_0003$$$::What...is he talking about?::
59265::$$$message_0536_0009_0000$$$::"What are you so shocked for? Saber is dead. She underestimated Assassin and lost to him. Is that so hard to grasp, boy?"[lr]::
59266::$$$message_0536_0009_0001$$$::"That's..."::
59267::$$$message_0536_0010_0000$$$::...bullshit, right?[lr]::
59268::$$$message_0536_0010_0001$$$::My left hand hurts.[lr]::
59269::$$$message_0536_0010_0002$$$::It really hurts.[lr]::
59270::$$$message_0536_0010_0003$$$::But my Command Spells are still there.[lr]::
59271::$$$message_0536_0010_0004$$$::They're growing fainter by the second, like they're about to fade, but they aren't gone yet.[lr]::
59272::$$$message_0536_0010_0005$$$::Then Saber still has to be out there, ready to come to me right now!::
59273::$$$message_0536_0011_0000$$$::"TO ME, SABER!"[lr]::
59274::$$$message_0536_0011_0001$$$::I scream, trying to drown out the pain.[lr]::
59275::$$$message_0536_0011_0002$$$::I cram as much magical energy as I can into my left hand.[lr]::
59276::$$$message_0536_0011_0003$$$::I don't know how to use the Command Spells.[lr]::
59277::$$$message_0536_0011_0004$$$::But if they're supposed to respond to their Master's wishes, then I'll summon Saber to me right now!::
59278::$$$message_0536_0012_0000$$$::"Argh!"[lr]::
59279::$$$message_0536_0012_0001$$$::Nothing happens.[lr]::
59280::$$$message_0536_0012_0002$$$::The Command Spells definitely reacted, and then they stopped.::
59281::$$$message_0536_0013_0000$$$::There's nothing wrong with the Command Spells.[lr]::
59282::$$$message_0536_0013_0001$$$::Then, that must mean the Servant they called is already...::
59283::$$$message_0536_0014_0000$$$::"Futile. Even the mighty Command Spells cannot resurrect a lost Servant.[lr]::
59284::$$$message_0536_0014_0001$$$::Even one as unlucky as you must understand that your Saber has perished at the hands of my Servant."::
59285::$$$message_0536_0015_0000$$$::"Don't you..."[lr]::
59286::$$$message_0536_0015_0001$$$::"Let's put an end to this. The Tohsaka girl still has potential, but I have no further use for you. Die in my holy land, along with your Servant!"[lr]::
59287::$$$message_0536_0015_0002$$$::"...BULLSHIT ME, MOTHERFUCKER!"::
59288::$$$message_0536_0016_0000$$$::I run.[lr]::
59289::$$$message_0536_0016_0001$$$::I charge at the enemy before me, trying to shake off the pain in my left hand and the horrible dread.::
