41768::$$$message_0365_0000_0000$$$::Going back over a month.[lr]::
41769::$$$message_0365_0000_0001$$$::He was summoned to this world before anyone else.::
41770::$$$message_0365_0001_0000$$$::He was not summoned to this country.[lr]::
41771::$$$message_0365_0001_0001$$$::A faraway foreign country.[lr]::
41772::$$$message_0365_0001_0002$$$::The ground is constantly covered in white, the sky is always gray, and the castle is built hidden in the mountains.::
41773::$$$message_0365_0002_0000$$$::It is always winter in that land.[lr]::
41774::$$$message_0365_0002_0001$$$::Coldness and stagnation, barrenness and longing.[lr]::
41775::$$$message_0365_0002_0002$$$::They are like living corpses, cutting off their connection with the present world and waiting for a reproduction of a miracle.[lr]::
41776::$$$message_0365_0002_0003$$$::The winter coldness takes away their human warmth,[lr]::
41777::$$$message_0365_0002_0004$$$::and the stagnant world won't allow them a new lifestyle.[lr]::
41778::$$$message_0365_0002_0005$$$::...His family were seekers of the Holy Grail.[lr]::
41779::$$$message_0365_0002_0006$$$::Spring won't come for the Einzbern family until the day their dearest wish is fulfilled.::
41780::$$$message_0365_0003_0000$$$::It has already been ten centuries since they started the search for the Holy Grail.[lr]::
41781::$$$message_0365_0003_0001$$$::After using every possible method to get close to the Holy Grail, they were eventually able to cast the Holy Grail out of iron.[lr]::
41782::$$$message_0365_0003_0002$$$::However, all they could make was the vessel.[lr]::
41783::$$$message_0365_0003_0003$$$::No Mystic dwelled within it, and they kept casting vessels that would never be filled.::
41784::$$$message_0365_0004_0000$$$::   But, a foreseeable end comes to those days.[lr]::
41785::$$$message_0365_0004_0001$$$::They performed a ritual to fill the vessel with the help of outsiders. [lr]::
41786::$$$message_0365_0004_0002$$$::The result was both a success and a failure.[lr]::
41787::$$$message_0365_0004_0003$$$::The Holy Grail was made.[lr]::
41788::$$$message_0365_0004_0004$$$::Through this, the Holy Grail would be filled.[lr]::
41789::$$$message_0365_0004_0005$$$::But, it made many enemies at the same time.[lr]::
41790::$$$message_0365_0004_0006$$$::Even as the supposed owners of the Holy Grail, they were reduced to mere "providers" of a service, no better than any other mage.::
41791::$$$message_0365_0005_0000$$$::Their tenacity is abnormal.[lr]::
41792::$$$message_0365_0005_0001$$$::No. Ever since they almost obtained the Holy Grail a thousand years ago, they had lost their minds.[lr]::
41793::$$$message_0365_0005_0002$$$::They broke the rules and constantly pulled the strongest card.[lr]::
41794::$$$message_0365_0005_0003$$$::The first time, they did not have the leeway to do so.[lr]::
41795::$$$message_0365_0005_0004$$$::The second time, they finally found a loophole in the rules.[lr]::
41796::$$$message_0365_0005_0005$$$::The third time, they summoned what they shouldn't have.[lr]::
41797::$$$message_0365_0005_0006$$$::Then the fourth time...[lr]::
41798::$$$message_0365_0005_0007$$$::They were sure of their victory after gaining the strongest card and its manipulator. ::
41799::$$$message_0365_0006_0000$$$::The results were a crushing defeat like never before.[lr]::
41800::$$$message_0365_0006_0001$$$:: Of all the Servants and Masters, they chose ones who betrayed them.[lr]::
41801::$$$message_0365_0006_0002$$$::The man destroyed the Holy Grail, leaving his daughter behind in the winter castle.[lr]::
41802::$$$message_0365_0006_0003$$$::They were furious at the man's betrayal and lamented their mistake.[lr]::
41803::$$$message_0365_0006_0004$$$::They could not trust outsiders after all.[lr]::
41804::$$$message_0365_0006_0005$$$::Only one of their bloodline, their family's creation, who had inherited Magic Circuits perfected over generations, could obtain the Holy Grail.::
41805::$$$message_0365_0007_0000$$$::They had a backup plan to start with.[lr]::
41806::$$$message_0365_0007_0001$$$::Then the fifth time...[lr]::
41807::$$$message_0365_0007_0002$$$::They made certain they prepared the strongest Master and Servant.[lr]::
41808::$$$message_0365_0007_0003$$$::That was him.[lr]::
41809::$$$message_0365_0007_0004$$$::Two months before the Holy Grail started.[lr]::
41810::$$$message_0365_0007_0005$$$::Every rule was broken for him, Berserker, to be summoned beforehand.::
41811::$$$message_0365_0008_0000$$$::The days that followed were only to hurt the human that would become Master.[lr]::
41812::$$$message_0365_0008_0001$$$::...The Command Spell engraved all over the girl's body was only to control Berserker.[lr]::
41813::$$$message_0365_0008_0002$$$::It did no good as a Magic Circuit and drained her life away.[lr]::
41814::$$$message_0365_0008_0003$$$::Even just a slight move by Berserker would make the girl scream.::
41815::$$$message_0365_0009_0000$$$::   It's no wonder.[lr]::
41816::$$$message_0365_0009_0001$$$::It was two months until the Holy Grail would appear.[lr]::
41817::$$$message_0365_0009_0002$$$::The only thing keeping this great hero in this world was her magical energy and Command Spell.[lr]::
41818::$$$message_0365_0009_0003$$$::Berserker was not created from the magical energy of the Holy Grail.[lr]::
41819::$$$message_0365_0009_0004$$$::No matter how special she is, keeping Berserker using only her own magical energy is like taking her own life away.::
41820::$$$message_0365_0010_0000$$$::Knowing that, they still did not allow for her to rest.[lr]::
41821::$$$message_0365_0010_0001$$$::They abandoned them in the winter forest, filled with a pack of hungry beasts.[lr]::
41822::$$$message_0365_0010_0002$$$::They gave them over to the corpses possessed by evil spirits.[lr]::
41823::$$$message_0365_0010_0003$$$::They were even thrown into the wasteland where they disposed of their failed experiments.[lr]::
41824::$$$message_0365_0010_0004$$$::The only way for the girl to survive was to rely on the giant, the only thing that she had been given.::
41825::$$$message_0365_0011_0000$$$::It was beyond training, it was a fight for survival. Yet the girl survived.[lr]::
41826::$$$message_0365_0011_0001$$$::She had the giant attack the oncoming enemies.[lr]::
41827::$$$message_0365_0011_0002$$$::Every time, she would let out screams of anguish but had him ceaselessly eliminate everything that attacked.[lr]::
41828::$$$message_0365_0011_0003$$$::...He himself does not know...[lr]::
41829::$$$message_0365_0011_0004$$$::...when that process became a special one to him.::
41830::$$$message_0365_0012_0000$$$::Despite the girl's young appearance, she hated whining.[lr]::
41831::$$$message_0365_0012_0001$$$::Everything that came out of her mouth was an insult.[lr]::
41832::$$$message_0365_0012_0002$$$::She must've instinctively known that if she was going to lament, she would become stronger if she hated the cause.[lr]::
41833::$$$message_0365_0012_0003$$$::The girl despised Berserker for being ugly and cursed his existence.[lr]::
41834::$$$message_0365_0012_0004$$$::It was natural.[lr]::
41835::$$$message_0365_0012_0005$$$::The girl would not have to suffer if he had not existed.[lr]::
41836::$$$message_0365_0012_0006$$$::She would not have been thrown in such a hell if she had not been chosen as Master.::
41837::$$$message_0365_0013_0000$$$::The girl detested the giant for everything and used him as an outlet for her anger.[lr]::
41838::$$$message_0365_0013_0001$$$::The girl got used to controlling Berserker, and by the time the Holy Grail showed signs of its appearance, the pain that attacked her disappeared.[lr]::
41839::$$$message_0365_0013_0002$$$:: The girl took away reasoning from the giant as if in revenge, treating him as a mute "mad warrior."[lr]::
41840::$$$message_0365_0013_0003$$$:: ...But he already knew that was the girl's utmost resistance.::
41841::$$$message_0365_0014_0000$$$::By doing so, the girl hid her own weakness.[lr]::
41842::$$$message_0365_0014_0001$$$::That she could live by herself...[lr]::
41843::$$$message_0365_0014_0002$$$::She held her head high since she didn't need any allies that she could trust or friends that she loved.[lr]::
41844::$$$message_0365_0014_0003$$$::...That was...[lr]::
41845::$$$message_0365_0014_0004$$$::Her way of disguising that she had nothing to call her own.::
41846::$$$message_0365_0015_0000$$$::                                            "...You're strong, Berserker."::
41847::$$$message_0365_0016_0000$$$::In the winter forest...[lr]::
41848::$$$message_0365_0016_0001$$$::The girl hesitantly touched his arm, stained red from the enemy's blood.[lr]::
41849::$$$message_0365_0016_0002$$$::Surrounded by a pack of beasts, the girl braced for death even as she desperately denied it.[lr]::
41850::$$$message_0365_0016_0003$$$::   At that time...[lr]::
41851::$$$message_0365_0016_0004$$$::He was not able to move without an order from his Master, so he was the first to become the beasts' prey.::
41852::$$$message_0365_0017_0000$$$::The pack of beasts pierce his arteries, tendons, and eyeballs with their fangs.[lr]::
41853::$$$message_0365_0017_0001$$$::The girl screamed seeing that.[lr]::
41854::$$$message_0365_0017_0002$$$::...He couldn't remember what she said then since he had his reasoning taken away.[lr]::
41855::$$$message_0365_0017_0003$$$::But the girl screamed not for her sake, but for his.[lr]::
41856::$$$message_0365_0017_0004$$$::Even though he destroyed her arm every time he swung his own, she endured it so that he did not die. ::
41857::$$$message_0365_0018_0000$$$::That's why both of them were covered in blood.[lr]::
41858::$$$message_0365_0018_0001$$$::The giant was covered in the slaughtered beasts' blood, and the girl was covered in her own blood.[lr]::
41859::$$$message_0365_0018_0002$$$::...He remembers that winter forest.[lr]::
41860::$$$message_0365_0018_0003$$$::The weight of the girl that leaned on him, crying tears of pain.[lr]::
41861::$$$message_0365_0018_0004$$$::And he realized.[lr]::
41862::$$$message_0365_0018_0005$$$::In that small, cold castle...[lr]::
41863::$$$message_0365_0018_0006$$$::The black giant was the only one that the girl talked to.::
41864::$$$message_0365_0019_0000$$$::"No... No, Berserker...!"[lr]::
41865::$$$message_0365_0019_0001$$$::She comes into view.[lr]::
41866::$$$message_0365_0019_0002$$$::It was the same as that time. The girl is running to him crying, which he had not seen since she had become a Master.[lr]::
41867::$$$message_0365_0019_0003$$$::And the man slashes her.[lr]::
41868::$$$message_0365_0019_0004$$$::With a horizontal flash, the blond enemy takes away the girl's vision.::
41869::$$$message_0365_0020_0000$$$::Her face is covered in red.[lr]::
41870::$$$message_0365_0020_0001$$$::The blind girl runs in spite of that, tripping over rubble.[lr]::
41871::$$$message_0365_0020_0002$$$::The slender body falls.[lr]::
41872::$$$message_0365_0020_0003$$$::There...[lr]::
41873::$$$message_0365_0020_0004$$$::The enemy's sword is swung.::
41874::$$$message_0365_0021_0000$$$::The sword misses her heart.[lr]::
41875::$$$message_0365_0021_0001$$$::Her lung must've been pierced, as the girl is coughing up blood, still on the ground.[lr]::
41876::$$$message_0365_0021_0002$$$::It is not an instant death.[lr]::
41877::$$$message_0365_0021_0003$$$::But, it is fatal.[lr]::
41878::$$$message_0365_0021_0004$$$::The girl is left with nothing as her vision is taken away, her lungs are broken, and she even lost her Servant.::
41879::$$$message_0365_0022_0000$$$::If she could die peacefully...[lr]::
41880::$$$message_0365_0022_0001$$$::It might at least be a salvation if she could just go to sleep right there.[lr]::
41881::$$$message_0365_0022_0002$$$::However...[lr]::
41882::$$$message_0365_0022_0003$$$::"...Huh?... It hurts, it hurts, Berserker..."[lr]::
41883::$$$message_0365_0022_0004$$$::The girl is moving forward, leaving a trail of blood behind.[lr]::
41884::$$$message_0365_0022_0005$$$::She crawls towards the black giant, fumbling and crying in anguish.::
41885::$$$message_0365_0023_0000$$$::How much power was left in him?[lr]::
41886::$$$message_0365_0023_0001$$$::He breaks the chains with all his might and grabs at the man.[lr]::
41887::$$$message_0365_0023_0002$$$::"...Heh."[lr]::
41888::$$$message_0365_0023_0003$$$::The magical spear is thrust.[lr]::
41889::$$$message_0365_0023_0004$$$::The spear pierces the giant's heart.::
41890::$$$message_0365_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41891::$$$message_0365_0024_0001$$$::And it ends.[lr]::
41892::$$$message_0365_0024_0002$$$::The man pulls out the spear as if nothing happened, and the remaining power in the giant completely disappears.::
41893::$$$message_0365_0025_0000$$$::His body disappears.[lr]::
41894::$$$message_0365_0025_0001$$$::The power that was giving him form had completely disappeared.[lr]::
41895::$$$message_0365_0025_0002$$$::Then, all there is left is for him to disappear.[lr]::
41896::$$$message_0365_0025_0003$$$::The Servant lost all his magical energy, and has no power to stay in this world any longer.::
41897::$$$message_0365_0026_0000$$$::He falls to the ground.[lr]::
41898::$$$message_0365_0026_0001$$$::But, in his final moment...[lr]::
41899::$$$message_0365_0026_0002$$$::He sees the girl fumbling around for him in his peripheral.[lr]::
41900::$$$message_0365_0026_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41901::$$$message_0365_0026_0004$$$::Strength returns to his collapsing legs.[lr]::
41902::$$$message_0365_0026_0005$$$::The law of magecraft that built him,[lr]::
41903::$$$message_0365_0026_0006$$$::the regulation of the world that hates inconsistencies,[lr]::
41904::$$$message_0365_0026_0007$$$::and the body of rock that crumbles away as sand...::
41905::$$$message_0365_0027_0000$$$::                                      "...You're strong, Berserker."::
41906::$$$message_0365_0028_0000$$$::He pushes away every power that tries to eliminate him just with his will.[lr]::
41907::$$$message_0365_0028_0001$$$::   I can't disappear yet.[lr]::
41908::$$$message_0365_0028_0002$$$::He is probably the only one who she could rely on.[lr]::
41909::$$$message_0365_0028_0003$$$::In order to support the lonely girl who insulted him, but still believed in him as her only reliance.::
41910::$$$message_0365_0029_0000$$$::"...Where I am I? I don't know, it's so dark I can't tell where I'm going, Berserker..."[lr]::
41911::$$$message_0365_0029_0001$$$::With her vision taken away, the girl is crawling with her arms stretched out.[lr]::
41912::$$$message_0365_0029_0002$$$::...She must want to feel him, as she cannot see him now.[lr]::
41913::$$$message_0365_0029_0003$$$::Her hands covered in blood grope at empty space, trying to verify his existence.::
41914::$$$message_0365_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41915::$$$message_0365_0030_0001$$$::There is no power left in him.[lr]::
41916::$$$message_0365_0030_0002$$$::There is nothing he can do.[lr]::
41917::$$$message_0365_0030_0003$$$::Berserker will fall here and die here.[lr]::
41918::$$$message_0365_0030_0004$$$::His body has died, and he has no strength to support his falling body.::
41919::$$$message_0365_0031_0000$$$::                     It's why I feel safe.[lr]::
41920::$$$message_0365_0031_0001$$$::                     No matter who it is...[lr]::
41921::$$$message_0365_0031_0002$$$::                     I won't lose against them as long as I have you, Berserker...::
41922::$$$message_0365_0032_0000$$$::But not this time.[lr]::
41923::$$$message_0365_0032_0001$$$::His mind is dead.[lr]::
41924::$$$message_0365_0032_0002$$$::Supporting his body with a mind and a will that should no longer exist, he leaves this world.[lr]::
41925::$$$message_0365_0032_0003$$$::His body has not fallen, still invincible.[lr]::
41926::$$$message_0365_0032_0004$$$::As if to say that his body cannot give up until the end for the sake of the girl that relies on him.::
41927::$$$message_0365_0033_0000$$$::...And the girl reaches him.[lr]::
41928::$$$message_0365_0033_0001$$$::The hand that was only grasping the air finally touches something.::
41929::$$$message_0365_0034_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
41930::$$$message_0365_0034_0001$$$::Coughing up blood, the girl clings onto the hard body.[lr]::
41931::$$$message_0365_0034_0002$$$::...She cannot see anymore, but she can still feel him.[lr]::
41932::$$$message_0365_0034_0003$$$::Berseker hasn't lost.[lr]::
41933::$$$message_0365_0034_0004$$$::She cannot see for herself, but Berserker is strong as always.::
41934::$$$message_0365_0035_0000$$$:: "...Yeah. I'm glad. Stay here, okay, Berserker?"[lr]::
41935::$$$message_0365_0035_0001$$$::Strength fades from her body.[lr]::
41936::$$$message_0365_0035_0002$$$::Everything hurts and she's scared, but it's all right as long as he's here.[lr]::
41937::$$$message_0365_0035_0003$$$::He always protected her.[lr]::
41938::$$$message_0365_0035_0004$$$::He was scary, but he was really nice.[lr]::
41939::$$$message_0365_0035_0005$$$::His big body is like a father's, so she really wanted him to pick her up at least once.::
41940::$$$message_0365_0036_0000$$$::"It's dark but I'm not scared. You're strong, Berserker.[lr]::
41941::$$$message_0365_0036_0001$$$::I can be relieved if you stay like this..."[lr]::
41942::$$$message_0365_0036_0002$$$::She rests her body on him.[lr]::
41943::$$$message_0365_0036_0003$$$::She feels like a hard and big hand is placed on her head.[lr]::
41944::$$$message_0365_0036_0004$$$::It's probably true.[lr]::
41945::$$$message_0365_0036_0005$$$::He should be patting her head if she opens her eyes.::
41946::$$$message_0365_0037_0000$$$::"...Yeah... It's a bit cold."[lr]::
41947::$$$message_0365_0037_0001$$$::Her body is cold.[lr]::
41948::$$$message_0365_0037_0002$$$::Recalling the forest from that time, the girl laughs.[lr]::
41949::$$$message_0365_0037_0003$$$::It was a long time ago already.[lr]::
41950::$$$message_0365_0037_0004$$$::Recalling the giant that protected her even while getting injured, she happily falls and loses consciousness.::
