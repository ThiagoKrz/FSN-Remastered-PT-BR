18636::$$$message_0173_0000_0000$$$::How should I spend those remaining hours? [lr]::
18637::$$$message_0173_0000_0001$$$::I thought a lot about it, but wound up here in the end.::
18638::$$$message_0173_0001_0000$$$::"This place...always remains the same. I enjoy the peace of the living room, but I am more comfortable here."::
18639::$$$message_0173_0002_0000$$$::"Yeah. For a Western knight, you look so natural with a bamboo sword. Plus, you like sitting seiza. We should've put on some kendo gear and had a match while we had the chance."::
18640::$$$message_0173_0003_0000$$$::"Wear protective gear? Why did you not say so earlier? I would have worn my armor while you put on protective gear for a mock match.[lr]::
18641::$$$message_0173_0003_0001$$$::...Yes, we really should have done that.[lr]::
18642::$$$message_0173_0003_0002$$$::If only you had mentioned it earlier, I could have gone all out in a match with you, Shirou."::
18643::$$$message_0173_0004_0000$$$::"Ack..."[lr]::
18644::$$$message_0173_0004_0001$$$::Saber's so cute when she pouts like that.[lr]::
18645::$$$message_0173_0004_0002$$$::Cute as she is, her actual words are pretty terrifying.::
18646::$$$message_0173_0005_0000$$$::"You're not really serious about going all out, are you? If you fought me without holding back, I'd wind up bedridden for a week."::
18647::$$$message_0173_0006_0000$$$::"No, that is not true.[lr]::
18648::$$$message_0173_0006_0001$$$::You underestimate yourself. You really have grown as a swordsman these past few days. At this point, you may even be able to land a hit on me."[lr]::
18649::$$$message_0173_0006_0002$$$::"Eh? Really?"::
18650::$$$message_0173_0007_0000$$$::Even if she's only flattering me, I'm delighted.[lr]::
18651::$$$message_0173_0007_0001$$$::How could I not respect Saber when it comes to swordsmanship?[lr]::
18652::$$$message_0173_0007_0002$$$::Being able to land a hit on my mentor is like proof of my growing skill.::
18653::$$$message_0173_0008_0000$$$::"For real? So...you're saying that if the conditions and timing were right, I might actually be able to land a hit on you?"[lr]::
18654::$$$message_0173_0008_0001$$$::"That is correct. You have grown strong, Shirou. You should be proud of that. I am very pleased."::
18655::$$$message_0173_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18656::$$$message_0173_0009_0001$$$::I can tell she's being honest as she smiles at me.[lr]::
18657::$$$message_0173_0009_0002$$$::When I see her face like that, my determination starts to waver.[lr]::
18658::$$$message_0173_0009_0003$$$::Afterwards...[lr]::
18659::$$$message_0173_0009_0004$$$::We won't be able to come back. If only we could just run away instead of facing a battle we have such a slim chance of actually winning.::
18660::$$$message_0173_0010_0000$$$::"Shirou? Why have you gone quiet?[lr]::
18661::$$$message_0173_0010_0001$$$::Are your wounds still hurting you? If so, you must rest in your room..."[lr]::
18662::$$$message_0173_0010_0002$$$::"No, I'm fine. Nothing's hurting."::
18663::$$$message_0173_0011_0000$$$::I push my hesitation aside.[lr]::
18664::$$$message_0173_0011_0001$$$::I can't run away, and this isn't how I want to spend my final moments with Saber.::
18665::$$$message_0173_0012_0000$$$::"Hey Saber. Since we're here, want to have a quick spar? Not a serious bout, just a fun, lighthearted match."[lr]::
18666::$$$message_0173_0012_0001$$$::I bury my feelings and try to put on as strong a face as I can.::
18667::$$$message_0173_0013_0000$$$::"Very well.[lr]::
18668::$$$message_0173_0013_0001$$$::Then I will fight in my own style, rather than kendo. Shirou, you can fight me in whatever style you want as well."::
18669::$$$message_0173_0014_0000$$$::She must have understood what I had in mind.[lr]::
18670::$$$message_0173_0014_0001$$$::Trading blows with a sword rather than words suits us better.::
18671::$$$message_0173_0015_0000$$$::For a short while, we forget about everything and just feel our bamboo swords whack at each other.‰Lw∏
