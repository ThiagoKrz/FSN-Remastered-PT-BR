15284::$$$message_0143_0000_0000$$$::I set a futon out in the living room and lay the unconscious Illya on it.[lr]::
15285::$$$message_0143_0000_0001$$$::She may have fainted, but her face is peaceful at least.::
15286::$$$message_0143_0001_0000$$$::"Hey, don't look away! The bandage will slide off!"[lr]::
15287::$$$message_0143_0001_0001$$$::I feel a hand slap my back.::
15288::$$$message_0143_0002_0000$$$::"Ouch! Tohsaka, is that any way to treat the injured!?"[lr]::
15289::$$$message_0143_0002_0001$$$::"Shut up! I'm treating your wounds, so hold still!"[lr]::
15290::$$$message_0143_0002_0002$$$::Come on, raise your right hand. I doubt you need it, but let me put some ointment on it."::
15291::$$$message_0143_0003_0000$$$::"Gah! Cold!"[lr]::
15292::$$$message_0143_0003_0001$$$::"If you can feel it, you're fine. Come on, let me wrap it."[lr]::
15293::$$$message_0143_0003_0002$$$::She wraps the bandage around my right shoulder with surprising skill.::
15294::$$$message_0143_0004_0000$$$::It's past ten.[lr]::
15295::$$$message_0143_0004_0001$$$::After our battle with Caster, Tohsaka began treating my wounds as soon as we got back to the living room.[lr]::
15296::$$$message_0143_0004_0002$$$::Well, she started, but most of my wounds had already healed, so now she's just fussing over me.::
15297::$$$message_0143_0005_0000$$$::"And we're done. Your body is nuts. Only vampires heal like you do.[lr]::
15298::$$$message_0143_0005_0001$$$::Are you sure you're human?"[lr]::
15299::$$$message_0143_0005_0002$$$::I think she's said something similar before.::
15300::$$$message_0143_0006_0000$$$::"Hey. I'm just an ordinary human being.[lr]::
15301::$$$message_0143_0006_0001$$$::Even I don't know what's going on with my body, so don't bother asking."::
15302::$$$message_0143_0007_0000$$$::"Don't mess with me. Who in the world could [font italic=true]possibly[font italic=false] be walking normally after getting their spinal cord severed!?[lr]::
15303::$$$message_0143_0007_0001$$$::Look, it's useful, so I won't question it too much. But it's also getting creepy. Don't tell me you can't die unless your head is chopped off!?"::
15304::$$$message_0143_0008_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
15305::$$$message_0143_0008_0001$$$::The scary thing here is that Tohsaka is serious.[lr]::
15306::$$$message_0143_0008_0002$$$::One of these days, she might actually try for my neck with an axe.::
15307::$$$message_0143_0009_0000$$$::"You think so too, right, Saber?[lr]::
15308::$$$message_0143_0009_0001$$$::I think you're the cause, but still...he's damn near immortal."::
15309::$$$message_0143_0010_0000$$$::"Huh? Are you saying Shirou's healing power is not his own?"::
15310::$$$message_0143_0011_0000$$$::"Of course not. Do you think someone who only knows Strengthening magecraft could do something like that!?[lr]::
15311::$$$message_0143_0011_0001$$$::This ridiculousness can only be a result of his connection with you. Your own healing power must be flowing into him."::
15312::$$$message_0143_0012_0000$$$::"Do you think so? I never felt that kind of connection with him before. If you are correct, my magical energy should be flowing into Shirou as we speak. More importantly, my healing power is not as strong as Shirou[line2]"::
15313::$$$message_0143_0013_0000$$$::"Saber? What's wrong? You just went pale."[lr]::
15314::$$$message_0143_0013_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15315::$$$message_0143_0013_0002$$$::Saber stares off into space, apparently not even hearing Tohsaka.::
15316::$$$message_0143_0014_0000$$$::"No, it can't be..."[lr]::
15317::$$$message_0143_0014_0001$$$::Saber shakes her head and looks down.::
15318::$$$message_0143_0015_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
15319::$$$message_0143_0015_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
15320::$$$message_0143_0015_0002$$$::Tohsaka and I exchange looks.[lr]::
15321::$$$message_0143_0015_0003$$$::Saber's acting...weird.[lr]::
15322::$$$message_0143_0015_0004$$$::Actually, I know why.[lr]::
15323::$$$message_0143_0015_0005$$$::Ever since that golden knight appeared, Saber's been pretty down.::
15324::$$$message_0143_0016_0000$$$::"Well, let's put Shirou's issue on hold for now.[lr]::
15325::$$$message_0143_0016_0001$$$::Saber, did you know that gold guy we met earlier? Goldy said something about you being his or something."::
15326::$$$message_0143_0017_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
15327::$$$message_0143_0017_0001$$$::Saber doesn't answer.[lr]::
15328::$$$message_0143_0017_0002$$$::She obviously doesn't want to talk about it.[lr]::
15329::$$$message_0143_0017_0003$$$::But I still want to know.[lr]::
15330::$$$message_0143_0017_0004$$$::Tohsaka's asking the questions I want answers to.::
15331::$$$message_0143_0018_0000$$$::"Saber. If you know, then tell us. Who was the guy? You called him Archer."::
15332::$$$message_0143_0019_0000$$$::"Yes. I hate to admit it, but I know that man. It should be impossible, though. There should only be seven Servants, so it shouldn't be possible for him to have been summoned as well."[lr]::
15333::$$$message_0143_0019_0001$$$::"A Servant...so he really is a Servant."::
15334::$$$message_0143_0020_0000$$$::That's pretty obvious.[lr]::
15335::$$$message_0143_0020_0001$$$::That could be a real problem for us.::
15336::$$$message_0143_0021_0000$$$::"His class is Archer. He is of course a completely different Heroic Spirit than the Archer who formed a contract with Rin. His abilities and temperament are different as well."::
15337::$$$message_0143_0022_0000$$$::I can tell.[lr]::
15338::$$$message_0143_0022_0001$$$::I only saw him briefly, but it was more than enough to get a sense of what a monster he is.::
15339::$$$message_0143_0023_0000$$$::"Hold on a minute. That doesn't make sense.[lr]::
15340::$$$message_0143_0023_0001$$$::If he's an Archer and a Servant, that makes eight.[lr]::
15341::$$$message_0143_0023_0002$$$::But only seven Servants can be summoned at a time. One disappearing doesn't mean another pops up to take their place. Besides, even the Holy Grail doesn't have the magical energy to summon more than seven."::
15342::$$$message_0143_0024_0000$$$::"There are only seven Servants because that's how many can be summoned at once. So how can they summon an eighth... Wait...[lr]::
15343::$$$message_0143_0024_0001$$$::Saber, did you meet him in the previous war?"::
15344::$$$message_0143_0025_0000$$$::"Yes, Rin. On the final day in the previous Holy Grail War...I fought him in the sea of fire."[lr]::
15345::$$$message_0143_0025_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15346::$$$message_0143_0025_0002$$$::For a moment, my entire body tenses.[lr]::
15347::$$$message_0143_0025_0003$$$::Saber fought in a sea of fire...?::
15348::$$$message_0143_0026_0000$$$::This is nothing new.[lr]::
15349::$$$message_0143_0026_0001$$$::I already heard from Kotomine that the fire was caused by the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
15350::$$$message_0143_0026_0002$$$::So it shouldn't be a surprise.[lr]::
15351::$$$message_0143_0026_0003$$$::I've been trying not to think about it all this time.::
15352::$$$message_0143_0027_0000$$$::"So what happened? Did you manage to beat him?"[lr]::
15353::$$$message_0143_0027_0001$$$::"I did not defeat him... That is, I could not defeat him. Because I..."[lr]::
15354::$$$message_0143_0027_0002$$$::"You were beaten instead.[lr]::
15355::$$$message_0143_0027_0003$$$::Unlike your messed up summoning through Shirou, you couldn't beat this guy even when you were summoned properly."::
15356::$$$message_0143_0028_0000$$$::Saber hangs her head, but doesn't answer.[lr]::
15357::$$$message_0143_0028_0001$$$::And that's answer enough.::
15358::$$$message_0143_0029_0000$$$::"Saber...couldn't win?"[lr]::
15359::$$$message_0143_0029_0001$$$::Not this imperfect Saber hobbled by my weakness, but Saber with nothing holding her back?[lr]::
15360::$$$message_0143_0029_0002$$$::...Is that even possible?[lr]::
15361::$$$message_0143_0029_0003$$$::If you consider her expressly in terms of her strength as a swordsman, Saber isn't invincible.[lr]::
15362::$$$message_0143_0029_0004$$$::She was weaker than Berserker.[lr]::
15363::$$$message_0143_0029_0005$$$::But Saber has her Noble Phantasm.::
15364::$$$message_0143_0030_0000$$$::The other Servants' Noble Phantasms are powerful, but Saber's exceeds them all.[lr]::
15365::$$$message_0143_0030_0001$$$::It's hard to believe there could be a hero in this world that her sacred sword can't defeat...::
15366::$$$message_0143_0031_0000$$$::"Then there's only one explanation.[lr]::
15367::$$$message_0143_0031_0001$$$::He wasn't summoned for this war; he must be a Servant who remained from the previous war.[lr]::
15368::$$$message_0143_0031_0002$$$::Nothing else makes sense."::
15369::$$$message_0143_0032_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
15370::$$$message_0143_0032_0001$$$::My mind stops working.[lr]::
15371::$$$message_0143_0032_0002$$$::It's not that I agree with Tohsaka's assessment.[lr]::
15372::$$$message_0143_0032_0003$$$::But she's just described what I've been hoping could be possible since yesterday.::
15373::$$$message_0143_0033_0000$$$::"But that is..."[lr]::
15374::$$$message_0143_0033_0001$$$::"There are not buts. It's the only possible explanation. Only seven Servants can be summoned for each Holy Grail War. If there are any other Servants here, wouldn't that mean they're the winners who survived the previous war?"::
15375::$$$message_0143_0034_0000$$$::There's a heavy silence.[lr]::
15376::$$$message_0143_0034_0001$$$::Yet.[lr]::
15377::$$$message_0143_0034_0002$$$::Why does Tohsaka look so pleased?::
15378::$$$message_0143_0035_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. Why do you look so happy?"::
15379::$$$message_0143_0036_0000$$$::"Isn't it obvious? There's precedent.[lr]::
15380::$$$message_0143_0036_0001$$$::I don't know who that guy is, but he's the Servant who won the last Holy Grail War, right?[lr]::
15381::$$$message_0143_0036_0002$$$::Then he must have obtained the Holy Grail. And he's staying in this world with its power."[lr]::
15382::$$$message_0143_0036_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
15383::$$$message_0143_0037_0000$$$::"That means he's proof that as long you obtain the Holy Grail, a Servant can remain in this world. I'd like to capture him and question him for more information.'::
15384::$$$message_0143_0038_0000$$$::    Yeah, you're absolutely right, Tohsaka.[lr]::
15385::$$$message_0143_0038_0001$$$::I don't who the heck that guy is, but he's a Servant, and he's remained in this world since the previous war.[lr]::
15386::$$$message_0143_0038_0002$$$::...Which means there's a way for Saber to do the same.::
15387::$$$message_0143_0039_0000$$$::"Well, I don't know who he is or what his motives are, but it doesn't change the fact that he's an enemy we need to defeat.[lr]::
15388::$$$message_0143_0039_0001$$$::Saber. So what's his true identity?"::
15389::$$$message_0143_0040_0000$$$::"I do not know. Even during the previous war, I could not determine his identity.[lr]::
15390::$$$message_0143_0040_0001$$$::He did not have a Noble Phantasm specific to him."::
15391::$$$message_0143_0041_0000$$$::"He didn't have a Noble Phantasm that made clear who he was? That's ridiculous. A Servant who doesn't have a Noble Phantasm wouldn't be a Servant, right?[lr]::
15392::$$$message_0143_0041_0001$$$::Besides, he just..."::
15393::$$$message_0143_0042_0000$$$::"That's right. He had plenty of them. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out his identity since he used so many. We just need to figure out which hero would match the shapes and sizes of the Noble Phantasms he used."::
15394::$$$message_0143_0043_0000$$$::"Then I shall ask you this: Do you remember any of the Noble Phantasms he used?"[lr]::
15395::$$$message_0143_0043_0001$$$::"Of course I do. Um..."::
15396::$$$message_0143_0044_0000$$$::Tohsaka thinks hard for a moment.[lr]::
15397::$$$message_0143_0044_0001$$$::She folds her arms over her chest, frowning.[lr]::
15398::$$$message_0143_0044_0002$$$::...And then just tilts her head in confusion.::
15399::$$$message_0143_0045_0000$$$::"No way. That's...impossible..."[lr]::
15400::$$$message_0143_0045_0001$$$::"Huh? What's going on, Tohsaka? What's impossible?"::
15401::$$$message_0143_0046_0000$$$::"I don't believe it. The one covered in blood was Dáinsleif, and that sickle-looking thing was Harpē...[lr]::
15402::$$$message_0143_0046_0001$$$::There was one that looked Chinese too, and I think there was one that looked like it was used by Acala..."::
15403::$$$message_0143_0047_0000$$$::Tohsaka looks almost crazed as she mutters to herself.[lr]::
15404::$$$message_0143_0047_0001$$$::She looks a bit like she's tumbling down a rabbit hole.::
15405::$$$message_0143_0048_0000$$$::"Um, so that one was similar to Saber's sword, but it should be different. The simple design looked like it must have come from Northern Europe, and I heard most originals of magical swords tend to take their cues from Nordic sources..." [lr]::
15406::$$$message_0143_0048_0001$$$::She's even starting to grind her teeth.::
15407::$$$message_0143_0049_0000$$$::"Hey, Tohsaka."[lr]::
15408::$$$message_0143_0049_0001$$$::Leaving her to her own devices will do more harm than good.[lr]::
15409::$$$message_0143_0049_0002$$$::If I don't stop her right now, we'll wind up paying the price later.[lr]::
15410::$$$message_0143_0049_0003$$$::Especially me.::
15411::$$$message_0143_0050_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, Tohsaka! Come back to us."[lr]::
15412::$$$message_0143_0050_0001$$$::"Argh, shut it, Shirou! You butting in is just confusing me!"::
15413::$$$message_0143_0051_0000$$$::"Uh...I'm not trying to butt in. You're talking about that guy's Noble Phantasm, right?[lr]::
15414::$$$message_0143_0051_0001$$$::Judging just from their shapes, there was Dáinsleif, Harpē, Durendal, Vajra, Caladbolg...oh, and Gáe Bolg.[lr]::
15415::$$$message_0143_0051_0002$$$::I don't know the Chinese one, but I think I covered all the famous ones."::
15416::$$$message_0143_0052_0000$$$::"Ugh...yeah, you're right on all counts..."[lr]::
15417::$$$message_0143_0052_0001$$$::I don't love the face she's making... It leaves me feeling even worse.[lr]::
15418::$$$message_0143_0052_0002$$$::I don't know much, but I just blurted out what leaped into my head.::
15419::$$$message_0143_0053_0000$$$::"But what does that mean!?[lr]::
15420::$$$message_0143_0053_0001$$$::There's no hero who has such an insane number of Noble Phantasms. And more importantly, the weapons are from all over the place, so I have no idea what the hell's going on."::
15421::$$$message_0143_0054_0000$$$::"Yes. That is why even I could not discern his identity.[lr]::
15422::$$$message_0143_0054_0001$$$::He employed a wide variety of Noble Phantasms, each of which should have been a sign of a specific hero. Archer had so many, I could not narrow down his identity."::
15423::$$$message_0143_0055_0000$$$::The two look perplexed.[lr]::
15424::$$$message_0143_0055_0001$$$::Well, with so many Noble Phantasms, we have no hope of determining who he is.[lr]::
15425::$$$message_0143_0055_0002$$$::It's like hiding a leaf in a forest.::
15426::$$$message_0143_0056_0000$$$::"Shirou. Don't you have any suggestions?"[lr]::
15427::$$$message_0143_0056_0001$$$::Tohsaka, obviously annoyed, glares at me, expecting...I'm not sure what. She's just taking her frustration out on me, I guess.::
15428::$$$message_0143_0057_0000$$$::"Like what?"[lr]::
15429::$$$message_0143_0057_0001$$$::"Like, anything you noticed, or deduced...any flash of inspiration.[lr]::
15430::$$$message_0143_0057_0002$$$::We need some real outside-the-box thinking here. Our only chance at solving this predicament is through sheer luck."[lr]::
15431::$$$message_0143_0057_0003$$$::Hm. She may be right.::
15432::$$$message_0143_0058_0000$$$::"Hahaha. I get it. You're making fun of me."[lr]::
15433::$$$message_0143_0058_0001$$$::"Rude. I just think you're no help in the first place. So...what do you think?"[lr]::
15434::$$$message_0143_0058_0002$$$::"I've got nothing."[lr]::
15435::$$$message_0143_0058_0003$$$::I raise my hands up in surrender.[lr]::
15436::$$$message_0143_0058_0004$$$::Tohsaka groans.::
15437::$$$message_0143_0059_0000$$$::"That leaves us with only one conclusion. Saber, do you think all his Noble Phantasms are fakes? There's no other explanation."[lr]::
15438::$$$message_0143_0059_0001$$$::"I agree. However..."::
15439::$$$message_0143_0060_0000$$$::"Huh? They weren't fakes."[lr]::
15440::$$$message_0143_0060_0001$$$::How did I figure that out?[lr]::
15441::$$$message_0143_0060_0002$$$::Besides, fake Noble Phantasms wouldn't have harmed Caster.::
15442::$$$message_0143_0061_0000$$$::"Hm. How do you figure, Emiya?"[lr]::
15443::$$$message_0143_0061_0001$$$::"I'm just saying, they were real. Actually, everything else seemed fake."[lr]::
15444::$$$message_0143_0061_0002$$$::"Huh!?"::
15445::$$$message_0143_0062_0000$$$::"It's...intuition. I can't explain it, but those were all real...[lr]::
15446::$$$message_0143_0062_0001$$$::Lancer's Gáe Bolg is real, of course, but the spear the other guy used is also the real Gáe Bolg."::
15447::$$$message_0143_0063_0000$$$::[font italic=true]What?[font italic=false][lr]::
15448::$$$message_0143_0063_0001$$$::Her making that face isn't making explaining this any easier.[lr]::
15449::$$$message_0143_0063_0002$$$::It doesn't help that I have no idea how I know this.[lr]::
15450::$$$message_0143_0063_0003$$$::I just [font italic=true]know[font italic=false] all his Noble Phantasms are real.[lr]::
15451::$$$message_0143_0063_0004$$$::I can feel it.::
15452::$$$message_0143_0064_0000$$$::Maybe it's because I used Projection during our battle against Berserker.[lr]::
15453::$$$message_0143_0064_0001$$$::After seeing all those Noble Phantasms, I can tell they're all real.[lr]::
15454::$$$message_0143_0064_0002$$$::A great weapon is imbued with specific concepts, while imitations lack something.[lr]::
15455::$$$message_0143_0064_0003$$$::I learned that much when I replicated Saber's sword.[lr]::
15456::$$$message_0143_0064_0004$$$::In that regard, I think all the Noble Phantasms that Servant had were perfect.::
15457::$$$message_0143_0065_0000$$$::"Let's just set what Shirou said aside.[lr]::
15458::$$$message_0143_0065_0001$$$::Since we don't know that guy's true identity, we should think of our next moves."[lr]::
15459::$$$message_0143_0065_0002$$$::Tohsaka sneaks a glance at Saber.::
15460::$$$message_0143_0066_0000$$$::"Assuming he's after the Holy Grail, there's one more thing bothering me.[lr]::
15461::$$$message_0143_0066_0001$$$::Saber, can I be blunt?"[lr]::
15462::$$$message_0143_0066_0002$$$::Why does she always have that mischievous look when it comes to topics like this?::
15463::$$$message_0143_0067_0000$$$::"What do you mean, Rin?[lr]::
15464::$$$message_0143_0067_0001$$$::If there is something you would like to know, you need not hold back."::
15465::$$$message_0143_0068_0000$$$::"Are you sure? Okay then. What do you think of him, Saber? From the way he was talking about you, he seems to have the hots for you."[lr]::
15466::$$$message_0143_0068_0001$$$::"..."::
15467::$$$message_0143_0069_0000$$$::I'm not following Tohsaka's lead, but I also sneak a glance towards Saber.[lr]::
15468::$$$message_0143_0069_0001$$$::I don't think Tohsaka has it wrong. He seemed obsessed with Saber.[lr]::
15469::$$$message_0143_0069_0002$$$::Actually, it's beyond being obsessed.[lr]::
15470::$$$message_0143_0069_0003$$$::From the very beginning, he only saw Saber as his possession.::
15471::$$$message_0143_0070_0000$$$::"I do not care what he thinks. I do, however, recall him proposing marriage in the previous war. Of course, I banished that idea with my sword."[lr]::
15472::$$$message_0143_0070_0001$$$::P-propose!? You mean THAT kind of proposal!?[lr]::
15473::$$$message_0143_0070_0002$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
15474::$$$message_0143_0070_0003$$$::What the heck is that Servant thinking!?::
15475::$$$message_0143_0071_0000$$$::"Whoa, I don't know that I should celebrate that, but I get the sense you don't feel too bad about it either.[lr]::
15476::$$$message_0143_0071_0001$$$::It's flattering for a woman, being proposed to, even after you've become a Servant."::
15477::$$$message_0143_0072_0000$$$::"That is not true. And I do not have that kind of freedom. My only goal is to obtain the Holy Grail.[lr]::
15478::$$$message_0143_0072_0001$$$::Honestly, that kind of nonsense irritates me."::
15479::$$$message_0143_0073_0000$$$::"Really? You might feel that way, but he seemed really into you. Guys like that? They don't get discouraged, even when you reject them.[lr]::
15480::$$$message_0143_0073_0001$$$::You're stubborn too, so maybe you two are a good match."::
15481::$$$message_0143_0074_0000$$$::Tohsaka's being irresponsible, so I'm not sure why she looks so amused.[lr]::
15482::$$$message_0143_0074_0001$$$::Tohsaka look like she's happy to have a conversation like this with Saber, even though Saber seems disinterested...[lr]::
15483::$$$message_0143_0074_0002$$$::"I keep telling you that I have no interest in such things. He is certainly a skilled Heroic Spirit, but he and I are of vastly different minds."[lr]::
15484::$$$message_0143_0074_0003$$$::Saber's responses are at least sincere.::
15485::$$$message_0143_0075_0000$$$::"Oh? Did you hear that, Shirou? Saber has no interest in men. Relieved?"[lr]::
15486::$$$message_0143_0075_0001$$$::"Rin. Shirou has nothing to do with this conversation.[lr]::
15487::$$$message_0143_0075_0002$$$::There is no logic in what you've just said."::
15488::$$$message_0143_0076_0000$$$::"I figured. My bad. But if you're not sure why I'm so amused, I have to say this whole thing is just funny."[lr]::
15489::$$$message_0143_0076_0001$$$::Tohsaka laughs menacingly.[lr]::
15490::$$$message_0143_0076_0002$$$::Her eyes make it clear she's laughing at me as much as at Saber.::
15491::$$$message_0143_0077_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15492::$$$message_0143_0077_0001$$$::I don't know what's pissing me off, but I get up without a word.[lr]::
15493::$$$message_0143_0077_0002$$$::"Huh? Hey, where are you going, Shirou?"[lr]::
15494::$$$message_0143_0077_0003$$$::"Tea. I'm getting thirsty, and I figured I'd prepare tea for everyone."::
15495::$$$message_0143_0078_0000$$$::I huff and head towards the kitchen.[lr]::
15496::$$$message_0143_0078_0001$$$::I don't know why, but I'm just irritated, so I decide to make super bitter tea for Tohsaka.::
15497::$$$message_0143_0079_0000$$$::"Then I'm going back to my room for now. Let's talk more tomorrow, when Illya wakes up."[lr]::
15498::$$$message_0143_0079_0001$$$::After teasing Saber for a good while, Tohsaka gulps down her bitter tea and gets up.::
15499::$$$message_0143_0080_0000$$$::"Yeah, go to sleep. Don't come back here."[lr]::
15500::$$$message_0143_0080_0001$$$::"Fine, fine. I'm leaving the rest to you here."[lr]::
15501::$$$message_0143_0080_0002$$$::I don't know why she's so amused, but Tohsaka's mood seems good even as she turns back to the outbuilding.::
15502::$$$message_0143_0081_0000$$$::"What will you be doing, Shirou?[lr]::
15503::$$$message_0143_0081_0001$$$::Your wounds may have healed, but you should not push yourself. You should also rest for the night."::
15504::$$$message_0143_0082_0000$$$::"Yeah, I intend to. But I'm going to watch Illya a little more.[lr]::
15505::$$$message_0143_0082_0001$$$::If she seems all right, I'll take her to the spare room and then I'll go to bed too."[lr]::
15506::$$$message_0143_0082_0002$$$::"I see. Then I will stay as well."::
15507::$$$message_0143_0083_0000$$$::And that's where our conversation ends.[lr]::
15508::$$$message_0143_0083_0001$$$::Tohsaka was the one making all the noise, so it's gotten awkward now that it's quiet.[lr]::
15509::$$$message_0143_0083_0002$$$::Well, it's not that it's awkward.[lr]::
15510::$$$message_0143_0083_0003$$$::I'm anxious because there's so many questions rattling around in my head...and so many things I want to say.[lr]::
15511::$$$message_0143_0083_0004$$$::Come to think of it, I haven't really been able to talk to Saber...::
15512::$$$message_0143_0084_0000$$$::...about the Holy Grail...[lr]::
15513::$$$message_0143_0084_0001$$$::...about her not being dead...[lr]::
15514::$$$message_0143_0084_0002$$$::...about how even if she obtains the Holy Grail, there is no salvation for her.[lr]::
15515::$$$message_0143_0084_0003$$$::There's no need to explain why[lr]::
15516::$$$message_0143_0084_0004$$$::She still doesn't have a wish for herself.::
15517::$$$message_0143_0085_0000$$$::"Saber. About our conversation earlier..."[lr]::
15518::$$$message_0143_0085_0001$$$::Our eyes meet.[lr]::
15519::$$$message_0143_0085_0002$$$::Hers tell me that she knows what I want to say.::
15520::$$$message_0143_0086_0000$$$::"Yes, what is it, Shirou?"[lr]::
15521::$$$message_0143_0086_0001$$$::She tries to divert what I have to say with her quiet tone.[lr]::
15522::$$$message_0143_0086_0002$$$::But I have to talk to her.::
15523::$$$message_0143_0087_0000$$$::"I said, about our earlier conversation...[lr]::
15524::$$$message_0143_0087_0001$$$::Tohsaka said Servants can stay in this world if they obtain the Holy Grail. So..."::
15525::$$$message_0143_0088_0000$$$::"No. I have no intention of remaining here. The moment I obtain the Holy Grail, I will return to my original time."[lr]::
15526::$$$message_0143_0088_0001$$$::"So you're going to redo the selection of the king? Rather than saving yourself from the brink of death...you want to start over from the very beginning?"::
15527::$$$message_0143_0089_0000$$$::"Yes. It is the king's duty to protect their nation. I was inadequate, so I must at least select an appropriate king in my stead."[lr]::
15528::$$$message_0143_0089_0001$$$::She says this like she's talking about a stranger.[lr]::
15529::$$$message_0143_0089_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15530::$$$message_0143_0089_0003$$$::For some reason, I get...real mad.::
15531::$$$message_0143_0090_0000$$$::"Y-you idiot! Wake up![lr]::
15532::$$$message_0143_0090_0001$$$::To hell with a king's duty! What matters is that you're here, so you should do what [font italic=true]you[font italic=false] want to do!"[lr]::
15533::$$$message_0143_0090_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
15534::$$$message_0143_0091_0000$$$::"You're strong, right!? Then finish off this war right now, get your Holy Grail, and quit being a Servant![lr]::
15535::$$$message_0143_0091_0001$$$::If you have a wish, don't use it to go back in time and redo everything! If you want to change, don't change your past self, but find a way to change now, [font italic=true]then[font italic=false] return to the past from here!"::
15536::$$$message_0143_0092_0000$$$::Saber doesn't answer.[lr]::
15537::$$$message_0143_0092_0001$$$::She sighs.[lr]::
15538::$$$message_0143_0092_0002$$$::"You are very persistent, Shirou. Please let this matter rest."[lr]::
15539::$$$message_0143_0092_0003$$$::She rejects what I said outright.::
15540::$$$message_0143_0093_0000$$$::"Obtaining the Holy Grail does not mean I can remain in this age.[lr]::
15541::$$$message_0143_0093_0001$$$::Archer...that Servant does not remain in this age because he obtained the Holy Grail. It was not possible to obtain the Holy Grail in the previous war."::
15542::$$$message_0143_0094_0000$$$::"Huh? What do you mean...?"[lr]::
15543::$$$message_0143_0094_0001$$$::"One cannot obtain what does not exist. On that night, when the town was ablaze, the Holy Grail was destroyed.[lr]::
15544::$$$message_0143_0094_0002$$$::Destroyed by my Master, who betrayed me: Kiritsugu Emiya."::
15545::$$$message_0143_0095_0000$$$::[font italic=true]What!?[font italic=false][lr]::
15546::$$$message_0143_0095_0001$$$::The edges of my vision go dark.[lr]::
15547::$$$message_0143_0095_0002$$$::I nearly fall backward, but catch myself with both hands.::
15548::$$$message_0143_0096_0000$$$::"Kiritsugu...Emiya...?"::
15549::$$$message_0143_0097_0000$$$::"Yes. Ten years ago, he was my Master in the previous Holy Grail War. Kiritsugu and I survived until the very end, and the Holy Grail was in Kiritsugu's hands.[lr]::
15550::$$$message_0143_0097_0001$$$::Archer and his Master were still left, and we had only to defeat them to bring an end to the Holy Grail War."::
15551::$$$message_0143_0098_0000$$$::"But Kiritsugu abandoned the Holy Grail.[lr]::
15552::$$$message_0143_0098_0001$$$::As a result, the town was consumed in flames.[lr]::
15553::$$$message_0143_0098_0002$$$::He ordered me to destroy the Holy Grail, as Servants are the only ones capable of touching it.[lr]::
15554::$$$message_0143_0098_0003$$$::Kiritsugu used his final Command Spell to force me to destroy the Holy Grail."::
15555::$$$message_0143_0099_0000$$$::"With the Holy Grail gone, Servants could not remain in this world.[lr]::
15556::$$$message_0143_0099_0001$$$::Kiritsugu did not try to keep me here.[lr]::
15557::$$$message_0143_0099_0002$$$::That is my last memory. I could not conclude my battle with that golden knight Archer, nor ask Kiritsugu why he betrayed me."::
15558::$$$message_0143_0100_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
15559::$$$message_0143_0100_0001$$$::It's not like I never thought about it.[lr]::
15560::$$$message_0143_0100_0002$$$::My old man was a mage. If he lived in this town, he could have been involved in a Holy Grail War.[lr]::
15561::$$$message_0143_0100_0003$$$::But still...::
15562::$$$message_0143_0101_0000$$$::"Why didn't you tell me, Saber? Why didn't you tell me my old man was a Master?"::
15563::$$$message_0143_0102_0000$$$::"A Servant typically does not retain their memories from previous summonings, and the same Heroic Spirit is not typically summoned as a Servant consecutively.[lr]::
15564::$$$message_0143_0102_0001$$$::I am an exception to this rule. That is why I determined it would be best not to mention that to you.[lr]::
15565::$$$message_0143_0102_0002$$$::And I was...not eager to speak with you about what sort of Master Kiritsugu was."::
15566::$$$message_0143_0103_0000$$$::"Huh? Why didn't you want to tell me?"[lr]::
15567::$$$message_0143_0103_0001$$$::"Shirou, in much the same way you have witnessed my past in my dreams, I have seen your past as well.[lr]::
15568::$$$message_0143_0103_0002$$$::I was surprised by your past, and could not believe how much Kiritsugu had changed.[lr]::
15569::$$$message_0143_0103_0003$$$::The Kiritsugu Emiya of your memories was a wonderful person. But he is nothing like the man I remember."::
15570::$$$message_0143_0104_0000$$$::"In brief, he was a typical mage. He acted purely out of self-interest, and he destroyed anything in his way. I saw not a hint of human emotion from him.[lr]::
15571::$$$message_0143_0104_0001$$$::In the course of the entire war, he spoke to me only three times.[lr]::
15572::$$$message_0143_0104_0002$$$::I do not think I need to explain those three occasions to you."::
15573::$$$message_0143_0105_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
15574::$$$message_0143_0106_0000$$$::"He was not brutal, or some gleeful murderer.[lr]::
15575::$$$message_0143_0106_0001$$$::He was wholly without emotion.[lr]::
15576::$$$message_0143_0106_0002$$$::Kiritsugu treated me as nothing more than a tool, and saw himself in much the same way."::
15577::$$$message_0143_0107_0000$$$::"Kiritsugu killed every single one of his own emotions, just as he killed each of his enemies.[lr]::
15578::$$$message_0143_0107_0001$$$::I never learned what drove him, or what he believed in. But in the moment I stood before the Holy Grail, he commanded me to destroy it.[lr]::
15579::$$$message_0143_0107_0002$$$::To be honest...[lr]::
15580::$$$message_0143_0107_0003$$$::Never have I more bitterly cursed the Command Spells, or a betrayer, than in that moment."::
15581::$$$message_0143_0108_0000$$$::   There's truth in Saber's words.[lr]::
15582::$$$message_0143_0108_0001$$$::No, they must all be true.::
15583::$$$message_0143_0109_0000$$$::I realize I knew nothing about what Kiritsugu was like before I met him.[lr]::
15584::$$$message_0143_0109_0001$$$::There was no way for me to find out what kind of person he'd been before that...and there was no need.[lr]::
15585::$$$message_0143_0109_0002$$$::Even if Kiritsugu Emiya was coldhearted, it wouldn't change a thing.[lr]::
15586::$$$message_0143_0109_0003$$$::The man who adopted Shirou Emiya as his son was so much warmer.[lr]::
15587::$$$message_0143_0109_0004$$$::That's the only truth about him to me.::
15588::$$$message_0143_0110_0000$$$::But what nags at me is...[lr]::
15589::$$$message_0143_0110_0001$$$::...if Kiritsugu truly was so ruthless, then his final moments were just too empty and futile...::
15590::$$$message_0143_0111_0000$$$::"I see. Then maybe I was able to summon you because I'm Kiritsugu's son."::
15591::$$$message_0143_0112_0000$$$::"I do not know. Kiritsugu summoned me after taking the proper steps. He had the aptitude to be a Master, and so was hired by a mage family with a long history to join the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
15592::$$$message_0143_0112_0001$$$::I hear that house provided everything he needed to be a Master." ::
15593::$$$message_0143_0113_0000$$$::"They excavated a relic of King Arthur from Cornwall and gave it to Kiritsugu to use for the Holy Grail War. Kiritsugu used it as a catalyst to summon me, King Arthur.[lr]::
15594::$$$message_0143_0113_0001$$$::And so Kiritsugu did not possess a connection to me, nor did he possess any attributes in common with me. There must be some other factor which enabled you to summon me."::
15595::$$$message_0143_0114_0000$$$::I got it.[lr]::
15596::$$$message_0143_0114_0001$$$::I'm not that surprised my old man was a Master.[lr]::
15597::$$$message_0143_0114_0002$$$::What does surprise me is that his Servant is the same King Arthur with me now.::
15598::$$$message_0143_0115_0000$$$::And one more thing...[lr]::
15599::$$$message_0143_0115_0001$$$::Saber said that the Holy Grail was destroyed.[lr]::
15600::$$$message_0143_0115_0002$$$::Then...maybe this war is meaningless to begin with.::
15601::$$$message_0143_0116_0000$$$::"I don't get it. You already knew there's no Holy Grail, right? So why did you decide to join this ridiculous war?"::
15602::$$$message_0143_0117_0000$$$::"I cannot say for certain whether the Holy Grail is truly here or not. But, so long as I have been summoned, there must be a Holy Grail.[lr]::
15603::$$$message_0143_0117_0001$$$::Have you forgotten, Shirou? I have become a Servant expressly to obtain the Holy Grail. Put another way, I would not [font italic=true]be[font italic=false] summoned to a place if there was no Holy Grail."::
15604::$$$message_0143_0118_0000$$$::"Oh...yeah, but...[lr]::
15605::$$$message_0143_0118_0001$$$::Then does that mean a Holy Grail can fix itself after it's destroyed?"[lr]::
15606::$$$message_0143_0118_0002$$$::"No. The Holy Grail is not something that can be easily replaced.[lr]::
15607::$$$message_0143_0118_0003$$$::A Holy Grail, once destroyed, cannot be restored."::
15608::$$$message_0143_0119_0000$$$::"But then..."[lr]::
15609::$$$message_0143_0119_0001$$$::"But it should exist. Servants are drawn to the Holy Grail and manifest. Without a Holy Grail, Servants will not appear.[lr]::
15610::$$$message_0143_0119_0002$$$::The priest mentioned that already."::
15611::$$$message_0143_0120_0000$$$::"The priest...oh yeah, that guy."[lr]::
15612::$$$message_0143_0120_0001$$$::The guy living in the church...the overseer of the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
15613::$$$message_0143_0120_0002$$$::The man who's managing the Holy Grail should be able to answer all my questions.::
15614::$$$message_0143_0121_0000$$$::The end of the previous war. [lr]::
15615::$$$message_0143_0121_0001$$$::The whereabouts of the destroyed Holy Grail, and how that Archer is still around.[lr]::
15616::$$$message_0143_0121_0002$$$::And...yeah, what did Kiritsugu see at the end of the battle that made him want to destroy the Holy Grail?::
