18820::$$$message_0179_0000_0000$$$::The moon hangs high in the sky.[lr]::
18821::$$$message_0179_0000_0001$$$::The clouds have finally cleared and the black of night is giving way to indigo.[lr]::
18822::$$$message_0179_0000_0002$$$::It will be dawn soon.[lr]::
18823::$$$message_0179_0000_0003$$$::The long night is about to end.::
18824::$$$message_0179_0001_0000$$$::   It will be the last one.[lr]::
18825::$$$message_0179_0001_0001$$$::During the night, Saber and I traveled to our final destination.::
18826::$$$message_0179_0002_0000$$$::"Shirou...this..."[lr]::
18827::$$$message_0179_0002_0001$$$::I hear the tension in Saber's voice.[lr]::
18828::$$$message_0179_0002_0002$$$::She's not the only one.[lr]::
18829::$$$message_0179_0002_0003$$$::As I quietly nod, I feel a cold sweat trickling down my neck.::
18830::$$$message_0179_0003_0000$$$::The mountain feels like a living thing.[lr]::
18831::$$$message_0179_0003_0001$$$::Chills run down my spine. Stifling pressure assails me with every step I take.[lr]::
18832::$$$message_0179_0003_0002$$$::The air is thick and damp.::
18833::$$$message_0179_0004_0000$$$::"The mana is dense. It feels exactly the same as ten years ago. I expect that, at the very top..."[lr]::
18834::$$$message_0179_0004_0001$$$::The summoning of the Holy Grail has begun. Maybe it's even over by now.[lr]::
18835::$$$message_0179_0004_0002$$$::Either way, Gilgamesh has probably defeated Lancer.::
18836::$$$message_0179_0005_0000$$$::"Let's go over it one more time, Saber.[lr]::
18837::$$$message_0179_0005_0001$$$::Once we reach the top, the only thing left will be the fight. You take care of Gilgamesh, and I'll take care of the Master...Kotomine.[lr]::
18838::$$$message_0179_0005_0002$$$::Neither of us will get involved in the other's fight. If one of us defeats their opponent, that'll be the end of it."::
18839::$$$message_0179_0006_0000$$$::"Yes. This time, I will concentrate on my own fight. Kotomine is an enemy you must defeat yourself."[lr]::
18840::$$$message_0179_0006_0001$$$::"Right. Yeah, leave him to me. And Saber...don't let him beat you."::
18841::$$$message_0179_0007_0000$$$::"Yes. On my honor, I will not lose to him. Not as a Servant, but as a Heroic Spirit, I shall not submit to that king..."::
18842::$$$message_0179_0008_0000$$$::There is no longer hesitation or worry in her voice.[lr]::
18843::$$$message_0179_0008_0001$$$::I don't need to say anything else to her.[lr]::
18844::$$$message_0179_0008_0002$$$::We will head to battle and determine the final Master in this war.[lr]::
18845::$$$message_0179_0008_0003$$$::But if, in the process…[lr]::
18846::$$$message_0179_0008_0004$$$::...if one of us dies, the survivor just has to kill their opponent.::
18847::$$$message_0179_0009_0000$$$::Even if I'm defeated, as long as Saber defeats Gilgamesh, Kotomine won't get his hands on the Holy Grail.[lr]::
18848::$$$message_0179_0009_0001$$$::At the same time, if Saber is defeated but I defeat Kotomine, Gilgamesh can't stay manifested.[lr]::
18849::$$$message_0179_0009_0002$$$::So we don't have to cover for each other.[lr]::
18850::$$$message_0179_0009_0003$$$::This battle is now each of ours alone.::
18851::$$$message_0179_0010_0000$$$::And so we climb the stone steps.[lr]::
18852::$$$message_0179_0010_0001$$$::The closer we get to the temple gate, the denser the air gets.[lr]::
18853::$$$message_0179_0010_0002$$$::Sweat trickles down my back.[lr]::
18854::$$$message_0179_0010_0003$$$::An ominous premonition creeps over me.[lr]::
18855::$$$message_0179_0010_0004$$$::At the top of this stone staircase, our greatest enemies await us.::
18856::$$$message_0179_0011_0000$$$::But...[lr]::
18857::$$$message_0179_0011_0001$$$::I don't really care about that.[lr]::
18858::$$$message_0179_0011_0002$$$::We go up the stairs.[lr]::
18859::$$$message_0179_0011_0003$$$::Closer and closer to the temple gate...[lr]::
18860::$$$message_0179_0011_0004$$$::Everything will be over.[lr]::
18861::$$$message_0179_0011_0005$$$::No matter who wins this battle, Saber will disappear.::
18862::$$$message_0179_0012_0000$$$::The endless, but fleeting days of fighting will finally be over, and Saber will disappear from the world.[lr]::
18863::$$$message_0179_0012_0001$$$::She'll return to her time, where she belongs.::
18864::$$$message_0179_0013_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
18865::$$$message_0179_0013_0001$$$::I can't say I don't have any regrets.[lr]::
18866::$$$message_0179_0013_0002$$$::I'm going to lose Saber.[lr]::
18867::$$$message_0179_0013_0003$$$::I'm going to lose the person I vowed to protect...the person I most want to be happy.[lr]::
18868::$$$message_0179_0013_0004$$$::Even now, I don't know just how painful that will be.[lr]::
18869::$$$message_0179_0013_0005$$$::For now, we're still walking together, and I can feel her presence.[lr]::
18870::$$$message_0179_0013_0006$$$::I'm not prepared to lose her.::
18871::$$$message_0179_0014_0000$$$::Even if I knew a few days before...[lr]::
18872::$$$message_0179_0014_0001$$$::Even if, from the moment we met, I knew we would eventually part ways...::
18873::$$$message_0179_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18874::$$$message_0179_0015_0001$$$::Thinking back, we made so many memories.[lr]::
18875::$$$message_0179_0015_0002$$$::We walked together some nights, fought together some nights...[lr]::
18876::$$$message_0179_0015_0003$$$::At first, I did everything I could to prevent Saber, a girl, from fighting. She also kicked my ass in the dojo.[lr]::
18877::$$$message_0179_0015_0004$$$::I also slept in the shed because I was too embarrassed to sleep in a room right next to hers. We ate lunch together.::
18878::$$$message_0179_0016_0000$$$::Saber liked baths, she liked my cooking, liked the clothes Tohsaka brought her, and she had incoherent conversations with Fuji-nee.[lr]::
18879::$$$message_0179_0016_0001$$$::She pushed herself, shouldered all the burdens herself, and finally collapsed...and then we explored the depths of our hearts in the ruins.::
18880::$$$message_0179_0017_0000$$$::Things took a turn after that.[lr]::
18881::$$$message_0179_0017_0001$$$::I couldn't stop thinking about Saber, my purpose for fighting changed, and I realized I loved her.[lr]::
18882::$$$message_0179_0017_0002$$$::How can I lose someone like that?::
18883::$$$message_0179_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18884::$$$message_0179_0018_0001$$$::Saber doesn't say anything.[lr]::
18885::$$$message_0179_0018_0002$$$::I can't think of anything to say either.[lr]::
18886::$$$message_0179_0018_0003$$$::Once we've climbed the stairs...[lr]::
18887::$$$message_0179_0018_0004$$$::...and reached the top, there'll be nothing for us to talk about.::
18888::$$$message_0179_0019_0000$$$::A little while later, I'll lose Saber and have to say goodbye.[lr]::
18889::$$$message_0179_0019_0001$$$::But...[lr]::
18890::$$$message_0179_0019_0002$$$::This is the only time we have to say goodbye.::
18891::$$$message_0179_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18892::$$$message_0179_0020_0001$$$::We climb the stairs...[lr]::
18893::$$$message_0179_0020_0002$$$::If I want to avoid saying goodbye, I just have to chatter about insignificant stuff like before.[lr]::
18894::$$$message_0179_0020_0003$$$::For example...[lr]::
18895::$$$message_0179_0020_0004$$$::Let's go to town when we go home.[lr]::
18896::$$$message_0179_0020_0005$$$::What should we eat for breakfast tomorrow?[lr]::
18897::$$$message_0179_0020_0006$$$::Insignificant stuff.::
18898::$$$message_0179_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18899::$$$message_0179_0021_0001$$$::I can't even seem to do that, though.[lr]::
18900::$$$message_0179_0021_0002$$$::Because whatever I say, those could end up being our last words.[lr]::
18901::$$$message_0179_0021_0003$$$::A clear end.[lr]::
18902::$$$message_0179_0021_0004$$$::Neither Saber nor I could say a clear goodbye.::
18903::$$$message_0179_0022_0000$$$::...And now we're at the temple gate.[lr]::
18904::$$$message_0179_0022_0001$$$::This is my last chance.[lr]::
18905::$$$message_0179_0022_0002$$$::If we proceed, it'll all be over.[lr]::
18906::$$$message_0179_0022_0003$$$::But if we go back...maybe I can think of something that would stop me from losing her.::
18907::$$$message_0179_0023_0000$$$::"...Saber."[lr]::
18908::$$$message_0179_0023_0001$$$::I stop and turn to Saber.[lr]::
18909::$$$message_0179_0023_0002$$$::She is the same as ever.[lr]::
18910::$$$message_0179_0023_0003$$$::Her face is composed, but her eyes seem tense, like she's trying to hold something in.::
18911::$$$message_0179_0024_0000$$$::The moment I see those eyes, I am assailed by temptation on all sides.[lr]::
18912::$$$message_0179_0024_0001$$$::Temptation to run away.[lr]::
18913::$$$message_0179_0024_0002$$$::Temptation to turn back so I don't lose her.[lr]::
18914::$$$message_0179_0024_0003$$$::Temptation to tell her what I really want, assuring me she'll accept.::
18915::$$$message_0179_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18916::$$$message_0179_0025_0001$$$::My resolve wavers.[lr]::
18917::$$$message_0179_0025_0002$$$::The temptations are begging, itching to be voiced.[lr]::
18918::$$$message_0179_0025_0003$$$::I bite my tongue.[lr]::
18919::$$$message_0179_0025_0004$$$::"Let's go. This will be our final battle."[lr]::
18920::$$$message_0179_0025_0005$$$::I tell her, just like usual, as her Master.::
18921::$$$message_0179_0026_0000$$$::Saber nods silently.[lr]::
18922::$$$message_0179_0026_0001$$$::I see the strength in her eyes, full of resolve as they always are.[lr]::
18923::$$$message_0179_0026_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18924::$$$message_0179_0026_0003$$$::I won't make any requests.[lr]::
18925::$$$message_0179_0026_0004$$$::The same way she believes in me...[lr]::
18926::$$$message_0179_0026_0005$$$::I'm going to believe I made the right choice.::
18927::$$$message_0179_0027_0000$$$::I cross the threshold of the temple gate.[lr]::
18928::$$$message_0179_0027_0001$$$::There's no turning back now.::
18929::$$$message_0179_0028_0000$$$::I can't say anything. Not that I could say what I really wanted, anyway.[lr]::
18930::$$$message_0179_0028_0001$$$::But I want to at least believe that this frustrated silence managed to convey my feelings.::
18931::$$$message_0179_0029_0000$$$::We've finished climbing the long stone stairs.::
18932::$$$message_0179_0030_0000$$$::This is our final memory of our time together here on this earth.::
18933::$$$message_0179_0031_0000$$$::The summit is bathed in a crimson glow.[lr]::
18934::$$$message_0179_0031_0001$$$::Wind whips at my face, seeming to come from that red light somewhere at the rear of the temple grounds.::
18935::$$$message_0179_0032_0000$$$::The air is heavy with death.[lr]::
18936::$$$message_0179_0032_0001$$$::It reminds me...[lr]::
18937::$$$message_0179_0032_0002$$$::...of that fire ten years ago.::
18938::$$$message_0179_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
18939::$$$message_0179_0033_0001$$$::But it's different.[lr]::
18940::$$$message_0179_0033_0002$$$::Bound up in the red light, I spy something that looks like it's going to ooze out over the temple itself.::
18941::$$$message_0179_0034_0000$$$::It's out, past the building.[lr]::
18942::$$$message_0179_0034_0001$$$::A glistening blackness, like mucus, spreads over the vivid red.[lr]::
18943::$$$message_0179_0034_0002$$$::The...mud spreads like oil over the clear ground.::
18944::$$$message_0179_0035_0000$$$::It oozes over the ground, contaminating it, killing everything it touches.[lr]::
18945::$$$message_0179_0035_0001$$$::It's like a visible curse.[lr]::
18946::$$$message_0179_0035_0002$$$::Even a mage like me, still in training as I am...[lr]::
18947::$$$message_0179_0035_0003$$$::...understands that stuff only acts on the human psyche, and will only swallow human bodies.::
18948::$$$message_0179_0036_0000$$$::"You're finally here. I've been waiting, Saber."[lr]::
18949::$$$message_0179_0036_0001$$$::Gilgamesh stands there, haloed by the vivid red glow.[lr]::
18950::$$$message_0179_0036_0002$$$::He pays no mind to the bloodred glow or the death-shrouded blackness.[lr]::
18951::$$$message_0179_0036_0003$$$::The Servant armored in gold waits in the middle of the temple grounds for Saber and Saber alone.::
18952::$$$message_0179_0037_0000$$$::"You've come at a good time. The Holy Grail has finally decided to show itself, and it's starting to open up.[lr]::
18953::$$$message_0179_0037_0001$$$::This curse is what the Holy Grail holds within it. It's the Third Element that keeps us Servants in this world.[lr]::
18954::$$$message_0179_0037_0002$$$::It's what spilled onto me ten years ago."::
18955::$$$message_0179_0038_0000$$$::Gilgamesh has eyes only for Saber.[lr]::
18956::$$$message_0179_0038_0001$$$::Saber is similarly focused on him.[lr]::
18957::$$$message_0179_0038_0002$$$::She steps forward and points her sword at the knight in front of her.::
18958::$$$message_0179_0039_0000$$$::"Gilgamesh. What are your intentions?[lr]::
18959::$$$message_0179_0039_0001$$$::That curse...what do you plan on doing with the thing that falsely presents itself as the Holy Grail?"::
18960::$$$message_0179_0040_0000$$$::"I've already told you that I have no wish. I don't care what Kotomine does with the Grail.[lr]::
18961::$$$message_0179_0040_0001$$$::Right now, my only interest is in you."::
18962::$$$message_0179_0041_0000$$$::As if to answer, the golden knight raises one arm.[lr]::
18963::$$$message_0179_0041_0001$$$::At the same time, a shimmering haze forms behind him.[lr]::
18964::$$$message_0179_0041_0002$$$::The king's treasure...hundreds of Noble Phantasms...are readied in that haze, like bullets loaded into a gun.::
18965::$$$message_0179_0042_0000$$$::"Ah...the time has finally come. I've been thinking of this moment for so long, Saber.[lr]::
18966::$$$message_0179_0042_0001$$$::I've been thinking of how to pin you down as you struggle, and make you swallow that mud.[lr]::
18967::$$$message_0179_0042_0002$$$::I'm going to stomp on your sobbing face and make you drink the mud until it's dyed your entire body. I've imagined you, writhing beneath me as the agony of death drives you mad, while your pathetic, filthy figure clings to my feet!"::
18968::$$$message_0179_0043_0000$$$::"Well said. You will, I am sure, not object to meeting the same fate then, King of Heroes."[lr]::
18969::$$$message_0179_0043_0001$$$::She takes another step.[lr]::
18970::$$$message_0179_0043_0002$$$::Saber walks right into range of all those Noble Phantasms.[lr]::
18971::$$$message_0179_0043_0003$$$::This isn't a battle I can help with.[lr]::
18972::$$$message_0179_0043_0004$$$::No ordinary human could step into this battle between Saber and Gilgamesh.::
18973::$$$message_0179_0044_0000$$$::"Heh. Precisely what I expect of you, Saber.[lr]::
18974::$$$message_0179_0044_0001$$$::You know you can't possibly win, but you are still defiant, showing your fighting spirit. You are truly a fitting finale for this festival."::
18975::$$$message_0179_0045_0000$$$::"I will not permit any outsiders to interfere. You, mongrel. If you plan to fight Kotomine, begone. He awaits you at the altar."::
18976::$$$message_0179_0046_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
18977::$$$message_0179_0046_0001$$$::Kotomine's waiting?::
18978::$$$message_0179_0047_0000$$$::I glance at Saber.[lr]::
18979::$$$message_0179_0047_0001$$$::She gives a slight nod, her eyes still on Gilgamesh.[lr]::
18980::$$$message_0179_0047_0002$$$::As I leave...[lr]::
18981::$$$message_0179_0047_0003$$$::...I feel her wishing me luck.::
18982::$$$message_0179_0048_0000$$$::I turn around.[lr]::
18983::$$$message_0179_0048_0001$$$::My opponent is elsewhere.[lr]::
18984::$$$message_0179_0048_0002$$$::Behind me...[lr]::
18985::$$$message_0179_0048_0003$$$::As I run, I hear[se volume=50 storage=se174] the sound of Saber's deadly battle beginning.::
18986::$$$message_0179_0049_0000$$$::Deep in the grounds...[lr]::
18987::$$$message_0179_0049_0001$$$::Behind Ryudou Temple's main building is a large lake.[lr]::
18988::$$$message_0179_0049_0002$$$::It's been untouched for a long time, making it seem sacred, like it's inhabited by a dragon god.[lr]::
18989::$$$message_0179_0049_0003$$$::The lake's clear, blue water is so pure and clean, with not a trace of cloudiness.::
18990::$$$message_0179_0050_0000$$$::At least, that was true until yesterday.[lr]::
18991::$$$message_0179_0050_0001$$$::The lake is far from pure now.[lr]::
18992::$$$message_0179_0050_0002$$$::Red phosphorescence spreads out before me.[lr]::
18993::$$$message_0179_0050_0003$$$::It is a sea of dark, murky tar.[lr]::
18994::$$$message_0179_0050_0004$$$::And...::
18995::$$$message_0179_0051_0000$$$::A hollow chasm yawns in midair, the body of a young girl floating near, in offering.::
18996::$$$message_0179_0052_0000$$$::"Koto...mine...!!!"[lr]::
18997::$$$message_0179_0052_0001$$$::I've been trying to remain calm all this time, but that sight drives me over the edge.[lr]::
18998::$$$message_0179_0052_0002$$$::I stop and glare at the enemy.::
18999::$$$message_0179_0053_0000$$$::"Welcome, Shirou Emiya, the final surviving Master."[lr]::
19000::$$$message_0179_0053_0001$$$::The ends of his lips curl up in a smile, and he spreads his arms in greeting.[lr]::
19001::$$$message_0179_0053_0002$$$::Our final battle will be fought here.[lr]::
19002::$$$message_0179_0053_0003$$$::This will be the summoning altar in this Holy Grail War.::
19003::$$$message_0179_0054_0000$$$::"Put down Illya. I'll thrash you after that."[lr]::
19004::$$$message_0179_0054_0001$$$::We're about ten meters apart.[lr]::
19005::$$$message_0179_0054_0002$$$::As soon as I take another step, the battle will begin.[lr]::
19006::$$$message_0179_0054_0003$$$::I don't know what kind of mage Kotomine is, but he likely uses projectile weapons like Tohsaka.::
19007::$$$message_0179_0055_0000$$$::On the other hand, my only option is to get close and punch him in the face.[lr]::
19008::$$$message_0179_0055_0001$$$::Even with Tohsaka's dagger concealed behind me, I still need to get close.[lr]::
19009::$$$message_0179_0055_0002$$$::Once the battle starts, my only option is to rush him and stab him in the chest.[lr]::
19010::$$$message_0179_0055_0003$$$::But before that, I need to do something about Illya...::
19011::$$$message_0179_0056_0000$$$::"Hey. Did you hear me? I told you to put Illya down. What kind of scum are you, taking pleasure in tormenting a child like her?"::
19012::$$$message_0179_0057_0000$$$::"Oh, I heard you, but I cannot do as you ask. The Holy Grail has appeared, but its hollow is still unstable.[lr]::
19013::$$$message_0179_0057_0001$$$::As the point of contact with the Holy Grail, I need her to endure for as long as her life lasts, or else my wish will not be granted."[lr]::
19014::$$$message_0179_0057_0002$$$::As long as her life lasts...? Then Illya's still alive!::
19015::$$$message_0179_0058_0000$$$::"If you have no intention of bringing her down, I'll have to make you.[lr]::
19016::$$$message_0179_0058_0001$$$::I'm going to stop your wish...this dark mud, right here, right now!"::
19017::$$$message_0179_0059_0000$$$::"Ah, I see. Do you believe this is my wish? I have to hand it to Kiritsugu, his son has [font italic=true]such[font italic=false] a keen sense of things.[lr]::
19018::$$$message_0179_0059_0001$$$::What a shock. Two generations of Emiyas, completely mistaken."[lr]::
19019::$$$message_0179_0059_0002$$$::"Wh...at!?"::
19020::$$$message_0179_0060_0000$$$::"I did not create this mud.[lr]::
19021::$$$message_0179_0060_0001$$$::This is the power flowing from the Holy Grail itself, though it should normally be colorless. It should be omnipotent.[lr]::
19022::$$$message_0179_0060_0002$$$::No mere human could dye it black.[lr]::
19023::$$$message_0179_0060_0003$$$::This Holy Grail has always been like this. The moment it is opened up, it will pour from the Grail without end, causing an unimaginable catastrophe."::
19024::$$$message_0179_0061_0000$$$::"This is the Holy Grail's true form.[lr]::
19025::$$$message_0179_0061_0001$$$::It is filled with all manner of malignancy...with things that curse the world and mankind indiscriminately.[lr]::
19026::$$$message_0179_0061_0002$$$::No one can control such a thing."::
19027::$$$message_0179_0062_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19028::$$$message_0179_0062_0001$$$::What...is he talking about?[lr]::
19029::$$$message_0179_0062_0002$$$::If that's true, he didn't become a Master because he had a wish to fulfill...but instead just so he could open this thing!?::
19030::$$$message_0179_0063_0000$$$::"...Kotomine. What is your wish?"[lr]::
19031::$$$message_0179_0063_0001$$$::I grind my teeth and glare at him.[lr]::
19032::$$$message_0179_0063_0002$$$::He smiles wider.[lr]::
19033::$$$message_0179_0063_0003$$$::"For fun, I suppose."[lr]::
19034::$$$message_0179_0063_0004$$$::It's such a simple answer.::
19035::$$$message_0179_0064_0000$$$::"[font italic=true]WHAT!?[font italic=false]"[lr]::
19036::$$$message_0179_0064_0001$$$::"Is that not clear? All right, let's take, for instance, music. Why do you feel pleasure from music, Shirou Emiya?"[lr]::
19037::$$$message_0179_0064_0002$$$::"Eh...wh-what the hell...?"[lr]::
19038::$$$message_0179_0064_0003$$$::"How about books? Why do you think stories draw people in?"[lr]::
19039::$$$message_0179_0064_0004$$$::Why? I've never...thought about that sort of thing before.::
19040::$$$message_0179_0065_0000$$$::"Indeed, there is little call to consider such things. Various forms of entertainment...things that please humans. They are all enjoyable because they were created by humans.::
19041::$$$message_0179_0066_0000$$$::"Listen. All creation springs from humans, from their own capabilities. That means the most enjoyable, pleasurable things are humans themselves. Humans, particularly [font italic=true]in extremis[font italic=false], are the greatest source of entertainment."::
19042::$$$message_0179_0067_0000$$$::"By comparison, entertainment humans [font italic=true]create[font italic=false] is but a pale shadow.[lr]::
19043::$$$message_0179_0067_0001$$$::Oh, yes. Music and stories...love, hate, trust, betrayal...morality, immorality, illusion, and truth...! These are no more than impurities![lr]::
19044::$$$message_0179_0067_0002$$$::Such things are second-rate as entertainment goes...hardly worthy of consideration.[lr]::
19045::$$$message_0179_0067_0003$$$::I want humans themselves to be my entertainment. None of the rest interests me."::
19046::$$$message_0179_0068_0000$$$::"And thus, such excess and extravagance must be trimmed away.[lr]::
19047::$$$message_0179_0068_0001$$$::You are familiar with the notion of one's life flashing before one's eyes, yes? It is precisely that. The only moment a human has any value is when they are on the very brink of death. All their lives are spent building up momentum until they finally [font italic=true]jump[font italic=false]...and reach for the skies. In that moment, they are dazzling, and it is that moment I desire most."::
19048::$$$message_0179_0069_0000$$$::"That is what you have always sought.[lr]::
19049::$$$message_0179_0069_0001$$$::As you all feed on peace...[lr]::
19050::$$$message_0179_0069_0002$$$::...I live by consuming this star's light."::
19051::$$$message_0179_0070_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19052::$$$message_0179_0070_0001$$$::Seeing the priest give such a sermon, his arms spread wide, is...strange to say the least.[lr]::
19053::$$$message_0179_0070_0002$$$::A chill runs down my back, but not from what he said.[lr]::
19054::$$$message_0179_0070_0003$$$::Seeing him like that, talking about human beings and seeming somehow sacred is what's giving me chills.::
19055::$$$message_0179_0071_0000$$$::"So, you're saying..."::
19056::$$$message_0179_0072_0000$$$::"Yes. The fire, ten years ago? Not bad. A little small in scale, but it still gave me a rush of exhilaration I've never before experienced.[lr]::
19057::$$$message_0179_0072_0001$$$::...And so, that is all I seek.[lr]::
19058::$$$message_0179_0072_0002$$$::The kind of hell that causes souls to burst...allowing humans to shine their brightest. Do you not want to bear witness to such a glorious sight, Shirou Emiya?[lr]::
19059::$$$message_0179_0072_0003$$$::What do you think? Do you not agree that the dying, agonized shrieks of humans wallowing in their regret fill your breast with the most indescribable pleasure?"::
19060::$$$message_0179_0073_0000$$$::"You..."[lr]::
19061::$$$message_0179_0073_0001$$$::Bull...shit.[lr]::
19062::$$$message_0179_0073_0002$$$::That day...[lr]::
19063::$$$message_0179_0073_0003$$$::How could he ever describe the hell of that day like that?::
19064::$$$message_0179_0074_0000$$$::"So you finally understand. Warped though it may be, there is no one in this world who loves humans more than I. And so, there is no one more worthy of the Holy Grail than I."[lr]::
19065::$$$message_0179_0074_0001$$$::The priest smiles, pleased with himself.[lr]::
19066::$$$message_0179_0074_0002$$$::Is he saying...[lr]::
19067::$$$message_0179_0074_0003$$$::...that he thinks all those people dying helplessly was a wonderful, beautiful thing!?::
19068::$$$message_0179_0075_0000$$$::"Oh, I understand, all right..."[lr]::
19069::$$$message_0179_0075_0001$$$::I focus on my feet.[lr]::
19070::$$$message_0179_0075_0002$$$::Every muscle in my legs tenses, ready to break into a sprint.[lr]::
19071::$$$message_0179_0075_0003$$$::"I understand [font italic=true]THAT YOU DESERVE TO DIE!!![font italic=false]"::
19072::$$$message_0179_0076_0000$$$::I surge forward as fast as I can.[lr]::
19073::$$$message_0179_0076_0001$$$::He's a little less than ten meters away. If I just head straight at him, I can[line2][lr]::
19074::$$$message_0179_0076_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19075::$$$message_0179_0076_0003$$$::I throw myself sideways.[lr]::
19076::$$$message_0179_0076_0004$$$::I want to just kill him...[lr]::
19077::$$$message_0179_0076_0005$$$::But my instincts kick in, saving me from death.::
19078::$$$message_0179_0077_0000$$$::"Hnnnghhh!"[lr]::
19079::$$$message_0179_0077_0001$$$::I go tumbling across the ground, scrambling to look up.::
19080::$$$message_0179_0078_0000$$$::"That was...!"[lr]::
19081::$$$message_0179_0078_0001$$$::I glance back at where I'd just been running.[lr]::
19082::$$$message_0179_0078_0002$$$::The ground is on fire.[lr]::
19083::$$$message_0179_0078_0003$$$::The dark mud spreading over the lake is steaming. [lr]::
19084::$$$message_0179_0078_0004$$$::It's like a dark carpet.[lr]::
19085::$$$message_0179_0078_0005$$$::The mud coils and lunges at me, snapping like a whip. It leaves a searing welt on the ground.::
19086::$$$message_0179_0079_0000$$$::"I should have mentioned that you are already well within my reach. Moreover, this stuff is extraordinarily responsive to the presence of living things.[lr]::
19087::$$$message_0179_0079_0001$$$::Dart around all you like, but if you are not careful as you do so, you will die."::
19088::$$$message_0179_0080_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
19089::$$$message_0179_0080_0001$$$::I leap out of the way of the black mud as it strikes at me once again.[lr]::
19090::$$$message_0179_0080_0002$$$::To hell with darting around blindly...this bastard's intent on killing me.::
19091::$$$message_0179_0081_0000$$$::"Kngh...you damn fake priest!"[lr]::
19092::$$$message_0179_0081_0001$$$::I reposition myself, keeping an eye on the lake.[lr]::
19093::$$$message_0179_0081_0002$$$::I'm no closer to Kotomine.[lr]::
19094::$$$message_0179_0081_0003$$$::Looks like he's gonna keep me ten meters away.[lr]::
19095::$$$message_0179_0081_0004$$$::That muddy tentacle seems to be able to stretch endlessly.[lr]::
19096::$$$message_0179_0081_0005$$$::It follows no matter how far I retreat, and it's not the only one.::
19097::$$$message_0179_0082_0000$$$::"Oh? Are you ready to face me? Good. I'm pleased.[lr]::
19098::$$$message_0179_0082_0001$$$::Had you just walked away, I would have had no way to kill you. But if you desire to fight, I have no issue.[lr]::
19099::$$$message_0179_0082_0002$$$::I am, after all, a humble servant of God, and could never kill one seeking salvation or aid."::
19100::$$$message_0179_0083_0000$$$::"Do you even hear yourself? I don't think that quite fits for a guy who has no problem attacking someone while their back's turned."[lr]::
19101::$$$message_0179_0083_0001$$$::He's probably remembering what happened with Lancer when I say that.[lr]::
19102::$$$message_0179_0083_0002$$$::Kotomine laughs, as if impressed.::
19103::$$$message_0179_0084_0000$$$::"Ah, yes. I got rather fed up with you at that point.[lr]::
19104::$$$message_0179_0084_0001$$$::We needn't put this off any longer.'::
19105::$$$message_0179_0085_0000$$$::"To be honest, Shirou Emiya, I had hopes for you. On the night Rin brought you to the church, I even felt the hand of fate at work. You have no idea the joy I felt when I learned you were Kiritsugu's son...and so like him as well.[lr]::
19106::$$$message_0179_0085_0001$$$::Ten years ago, I didn't get my wish... I never expected a chance to get my revenge on Kiritsugu like this."::
19107::$$$message_0179_0086_0000$$$::The tentacle twists toward me.[lr]::
19108::$$$message_0179_0086_0001$$$::It looms over the lake, its sickle-shaped head like a dark serpent.::
19109::$$$message_0179_0087_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19110::$$$message_0179_0087_0001$$$::I bite my lip.[lr]::
19111::$$$message_0179_0087_0002$$$::I'm in about the worst possible situation here.[lr]::
19112::$$$message_0179_0087_0003$$$::More and more tentacles emerge from the lake.[lr]::
19113::$$$message_0179_0087_0004$$$::I'm not sure how much longer I can even survive, to say nothing of getting near Kotomine.::
19114::$$$message_0179_0088_0000$$$::"You obviously have no chance of winning.[lr]::
19115::$$$message_0179_0088_0001$$$::The gap in our experience is considerable. Unless you have some major factor which can multiply your experience, that difference will not be easily overcome."::
19116::$$$message_0179_0089_0000$$$::The priest raises his hands.[lr]::
19117::$$$message_0179_0089_0001$$$::He stares at the heavens like a conductor leading an orchestra.::
19118::$$$message_0179_0090_0000$$$::"Put your life on the line.[lr]::
19119::$$$message_0179_0090_0001$$$::Maybe then you will be able to reach me!"::
19120::$$$message_0179_0091_0000$$$::The serpents surge forward.::
19121::$$$message_0179_0092_0000$$$::Sparks fly in all directions.[lr]::
19122::$$$message_0179_0092_0001$$$::The golden knight steps back, evading a series of savage attacks executed with astonishing skill.[lr]::
19123::$$$message_0179_0092_0002$$$::She must have seen it as an opening.[lr]::
19124::$$$message_0179_0092_0003$$$::Saber twists away from a short sword fired at her and takes a step toward her enemy.::
19125::$$$message_0179_0093_0000$$$::"Yaaaaaah!!!"[lr]::
19126::$$$message_0179_0093_0001$$$::Her shout tears through space. Her sword strikes like a comet.[lr]::
19127::$$$message_0179_0093_0002$$$::She presses the attack on the golden knight. He stumbles backward, overwhelmed by her skill and ferocity.[lr]::
19128::$$$message_0179_0093_0003$$$::Her sword dances.[lr]::
19129::$$$message_0179_0093_0004$$$::So titanic is the strength behind her every blow, each could shatter boulders, smash down the walls of even the most impregnable fortress. And yet...[lr]::
19130::$$$message_0179_0093_0005$$$::"Tch...!"[lr]::
19131::$$$message_0179_0093_0006$$$::The myriad deadly weapons appearing from behind her enemy turn aside every strike.::
19132::$$$message_0179_0094_0000$$$::"So annoying!"[lr]::
19133::$$$message_0179_0094_0001$$$::Gilgamesh slips back from the onslaught, another sword in his hand.[lr]::
19134::$$$message_0179_0094_0002$$$::"Hngh!"[lr]::
19135::$$$message_0179_0094_0003$$$::It's easy enough for her to repel his strikes.[lr]::
19136::$$$message_0179_0094_0004$$$::But she can't meet his attacks directly.[lr]::
19137::$$$message_0179_0094_0005$$$::Each of the enemy's weapons has abilities she simply does not know.[lr]::
19138::$$$message_0179_0094_0006$$$::Being struck by a weapon and not knowing what it might do is suicide.::
19139::$$$message_0179_0095_0000$$$::"Ha...haaah...ha..."[lr]::
19140::$$$message_0179_0095_0001$$$::Saber steps away from her cornered enemy to compose herself.[lr]::
19141::$$$message_0179_0095_0002$$$::Gilgamesh, on the other hand, is not at all troubled, and picks himself up.::
19142::$$$message_0179_0096_0000$$$::"You are nothing if not persistent, woman. Can you not see how futile this all is?"[lr]::
19143::$$$message_0179_0096_0001$$$::Gilgamesh shows no sign of fatigue.[lr]::
19144::$$$message_0179_0096_0002$$$::To him, this battle is merely a bit of entertainment.[lr]::
19145::$$$message_0179_0096_0003$$$::He can't very well feel nervous or tired when he knows with perfect certainty that he will win.::
19146::$$$message_0179_0097_0000$$$::"Hah...ha...ha.."[lr]::
19147::$$$message_0179_0097_0001$$$::It is another matter entirely for Saber.[lr]::
19148::$$$message_0179_0097_0002$$$::She knows that her only shot at victory is now.[lr]::
19149::$$$message_0179_0097_0003$$$::...Before her enemy starts taking this seriously.[lr]::
19150::$$$message_0179_0097_0004$$$::She needs to defeat Gilgamesh before he can use Ea, or she will lose.::
19151::$$$message_0179_0098_0000$$$::And so, even knowing that it may be impossible, she does not relent in her onslaught, giving no thought to her own stamina.[lr]::
19152::$$$message_0179_0098_0001$$$::This isn't the first time she's cornered her enemy. Or the second.[lr]::
19153::$$$message_0179_0098_0002$$$::But she's never been able to break through his wall of Noble Phantasms.::
19154::$$$message_0179_0099_0000$$$::"Do you intend to keep going? It is all fine and good to be loyal to your lord, but surely even that has its limits. Kotomine must have killed the mongrel by now. You have no reason to keep fighting."[lr]::
19155::$$$message_0179_0099_0001$$$::"My Master is still alive. Shirou will not fall to a Master like that man."::
19156::$$$message_0179_0100_0000$$$::"It's only a matter of time. You do not know the true nature of the Holy Grail. Even I have trouble handling that thing. The boy won't last a minute against it."[lr]::
19157::$$$message_0179_0100_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19158::$$$message_0179_0100_0002$$$::"You have no hope of besting me, just as the child has no hope of besting Kotomine.[lr]::
19159::$$$message_0179_0100_0003$$$::You have mistaken your roles. Were it you facing the Holy Grail now, the battle would have been yours."::
19160::$$$message_0179_0101_0000$$$::There is no amusement in the golden knight's eyes.[lr]::
19161::$$$message_0179_0101_0001$$$::He's serious.[lr]::
19162::$$$message_0179_0101_0002$$$::But that's wrong.[lr]::
19163::$$$message_0179_0101_0003$$$::To Saber, the choice itself was a mistake.::
19164::$$$message_0179_0102_0000$$$::"Nonsense. This was the correct choice. You will no more defeat me than that corpse of a man will defeat Shirou.[lr]::
19165::$$$message_0179_0102_0001$$$::How the mighty King of Heroes has fallen, hoping for what has yet to take place."[lr]::
19166::$$$message_0179_0102_0002$$$::"Oh? So you still have strength enough for such impudence, do you?"[lr]::
19167::$$$message_0179_0102_0003$$$::The air around Gilgamesh twists and distorts.[lr]::
19168::$$$message_0179_0102_0004$$$::More and more Noble Phantasms appear behind him.::
19169::$$$message_0179_0103_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"Here he comes..."[font italic=false][lr]::
19170::$$$message_0179_0103_0001$$$::She adjusts her grip on her sacred sword.[lr]::
19171::$$$message_0179_0103_0002$$$::In truth, there is a way.[lr]::
19172::$$$message_0179_0103_0003$$$::There's only one way to defeat that golden knight.[lr]::
19173::$$$message_0179_0103_0004$$$::"But in order to do so..."[lr]::
19174::$$$message_0179_0103_0005$$$::For her plan to succeed, certain conditions must be met.::
19175::$$$message_0179_0104_0000$$$::Even if she takes out Ea, he will still be able to defend against her attack if he has any energy left. She would also have to take Ea's attack head-on again to be sure whether it's even possible to defeat.[lr]::

19177::$$$message_0179_0104_0002$$$::But there is no other way to win.[lr]::
19178::$$$message_0179_0104_0003$$$::It is just a matter of how to spin that thin thread of hope into real victory.::
19179::$$$message_0179_0105_0000$$$::Normally, her intuition would show her the best route, and she would act in accordance with what she sees.[lr]::
19180::$$$message_0179_0105_0001$$$::But that intuition is no help now.[lr]::
19181::$$$message_0179_0105_0002$$$::Perhaps her chances for victory are so slim that her intuition cannot show her the path.::
19182::$$$message_0179_0106_0000$$$::"Ungh...!"[lr]::
19183::$$$message_0179_0106_0001$$$::But she still has to fight.[lr]::
19184::$$$message_0179_0106_0002$$$::She has to keep fighting, for Shirou, who surrendered his own defense by returning the sheath to her. She [font italic=true]cannot[font italic=false] let this man defeat her.::
19185::$$$message_0179_0107_0000$$$::"Ah. It appears that, to convince you, I must confront you with absolute defeat."[lr]::
19186::$$$message_0179_0107_0001$$$::Even more weapons appear behind Gilgamesh.[lr]::
19187::$$$message_0179_0107_0002$$$::Every single one aims toward Saber, moving without Gilgamesh even touching them.[lr]::
19188::$$$message_0179_0107_0003$$$::Before, only the hilts were visible, but now the blades emerge, awaiting their master's command.::
19189::$$$message_0179_0108_0000$$$::This is the way knights should fight.[lr]::
19190::$$$message_0179_0108_0001$$$::Gilgamesh was never a swordsman.[lr]::
19191::$$$message_0179_0108_0002$$$::His many Noble Phantasms are deployed within time and space, and become bullets under their master's command.[lr]::
19192::$$$message_0179_0108_0003$$$::This is why he is an Archer.[lr]::
19193::$$$message_0179_0108_0004$$$::He is the strongest in that regard.::
19194::$$$message_0179_0109_0000$$$::"Dodge these, if you can.[lr]::
19195::$$$message_0179_0109_0001$$$::If you're lucky, they'll only impale your limbs!"[lr]::
19196::$$$message_0179_0109_0002$$$::"Agh!"[lr]::
19197::$$$message_0179_0109_0003$$$::With a single command, a rain of swords descends on her with godlike speed.[lr]::
19198::$$$message_0179_0109_0004$$$::Each of them possesses its own special, fatal power.[lr]::
19199::$$$message_0179_0109_0005$$$::"Hngh!"[lr]::
19200::$$$message_0179_0109_0006$$$::She evades every single one as if gracefully slipping between falling leaves.::
19201::$$$message_0179_0110_0000$$$::A sword from the front.[lr]::
19202::$$$message_0179_0110_0001$$$::A spear from the left.[lr]::
19203::$$$message_0179_0110_0002$$$::Polearms from above and below.[lr]::
19204::$$$message_0179_0110_0003$$$::A three-pronged sword sweeping at her in an arc.[lr]::
19205::$$$message_0179_0110_0004$$$::A hammer larger even than her streaks toward her like a meteor![lr]::
19206::$$$message_0179_0110_0005$$$::She blocks, parries, dodges, then twists away from the final attack!::
19207::$$$message_0179_0111_0000$$$::"Ha...ah!"[lr]::
19208::$$$message_0179_0111_0001$$$::Saber's breathing is labored, and she struggles to regain her ground after being put on the back foot.[lr]::
19209::$$$message_0179_0111_0002$$$::At that moment...[lr]::
19210::$$$message_0179_0111_0003$$$::She sees something behind her enemy.[lr]::
19211::$$$message_0179_0111_0004$$$::Behind Gilgamesh...[lr]::
19212::$$$message_0179_0111_0005$$$::...forty-seven Noble Phantasms are already deployed, all at the ready.::
19213::$$$message_0179_0112_0000$$$::"Kngh...haaah!"[lr]::
19214::$$$message_0179_0112_0001$$$::She leaps with all her might.[lr]::
19215::$$$message_0179_0112_0002$$$::As if to prevent her from escaping, a flurry of Noble Phantasms races toward her, tearing up the earth.::
19216::$$$message_0179_0113_0000$$$::A torrent of Noble Phantasms slams into the ground one after another.[lr]::
19217::$$$message_0179_0113_0001$$$::Her armor is shattered, her gauntlet is split open, and even her greaves are impaled.[lr]::
19218::$$$message_0179_0113_0002$$$::Saber manages to avoid sustaining any fatal wounds, but in that moment, she sees something even worse.::
19219::$$$message_0179_0114_0000$$$::Beyond the rain of Noble Phantasms...[lr]::
19220::$$$message_0179_0114_0001$$$::...as if to finish off his exhausted prey, the King of Heroes draws his favorite sword.[lr]::
19221::$$$message_0179_0114_0002$$$::[font italic=true]"Ea...!"[font italic=false][lr]::
19222::$$$message_0179_0114_0003$$$::Saber lets gravity carry her back to the ground.[lr]::
19223::$$$message_0179_0114_0004$$$::She lands hard and immediately pours magical energy into her sword.::
19224::$$$message_0179_0115_0000$$$::But she isn't sure she can make it in time.[lr]::
19225::$$$message_0179_0115_0001$$$::The wind howls. The blade of light emerges and she raises her sword without waiting for the wind to finish unraveling.::
19226::$$$message_0179_0116_0000$$$::"EX..."[lr]::
19227::$$$message_0179_0116_0001$$$::She doesn't bother deflecting the rain of Noble Phantasms; she simply swings her sacred sword with all her might and all the swiftness she can muster.[lr]::
19228::$$$message_0179_0116_0002$$$::"Enuma...Elish!"[lr]::
19229::$$$message_0179_0116_0003$$$::She's too late.[lr]::
19230::$$$message_0179_0116_0004$$$::Gilgamesh sweeps his other Noble Phantasms aside and swings Ea.::
19231::$$$message_0179_0117_0000$$$::"Gngh...!"[lr]::
19232::$$$message_0179_0117_0001$$$::I try to kick away the mud clinging to my ankles.[lr]::
19233::$$$message_0179_0117_0002$$$::My clothes are burnt, and my skin is exposed.::
19234::$$$message_0179_0118_0000$$$::"Ngh...ghhh!"[lr]::
19235::$$$message_0179_0118_0001$$$::I jump away from the lunging tentacle.[lr]::
19236::$$$message_0179_0118_0002$$$::I can't feel my mud-coated right ankle, and I wasn't entirely sure I even still had my right leg until I used it to leap away.::
19237::$$$message_0179_0119_0000$$$::"Tah! Ha...haaah...haa...ah!"[lr]::
19238::$$$message_0179_0119_0001$$$::I check my body while I roll.[lr]::
19239::$$$message_0179_0119_0002$$$::Ankle...okay, yeah it's still there. I just can't feel it. If it's more or less intact, I can still probably run.::
19240::$$$message_0179_0120_0000$$$::"Ah...haaa...ha...ah!"[lr]::
19241::$$$message_0179_0120_0001$$$::I jump in another direction to avoid the mud's relentless attacks.::
19242::$$$message_0179_0121_0000$$$::Beside me, I hear a splash.[lr]::
19243::$$$message_0179_0121_0001$$$::The scent of burning earth wakes my dizzy head, and I push myself back up to my feet.::
19244::$$$message_0179_0122_0000$$$::"Hnnnnnnnnnh!!!"[lr]::
19245::$$$message_0179_0122_0001$$$::A burning sensation sears its way down my back.[lr]::
19246::$$$message_0179_0122_0002$$$::"Ha...the...hell...?"[lr]::
19247::$$$message_0179_0122_0003$$$::I shake it off and jump to the closest clear ground.[lr]::
19248::$$$message_0179_0122_0004$$$::The mud's pursuit relents.[lr]::
19249::$$$message_0179_0122_0005$$$::I can no longer see any of the black mud that surrounded me.::
19250::$$$message_0179_0123_0000$$$::"Ha...ah...ah."[lr]::
19251::$$$message_0179_0123_0001$$$::I bite my lip.[lr]::
19252::$$$message_0179_0123_0002$$$::I dodged and ran all over the place. But in the end..[lr]::
19253::$$$message_0179_0123_0003$$$::I'm right back here.::
19254::$$$message_0179_0124_0000$$$::"Ha...haaah...ha..."[lr]::
19255::$$$message_0179_0124_0001$$$::I calm my breathing, and look up at him to at least show he hasn't broken my spirit.[lr]::
19256::$$$message_0179_0124_0002$$$::Kotomine has not moved at all. He's just watched me running around.::
19257::$$$message_0179_0125_0000$$$::"Ha...ha...haaa...ha...haaa."[lr]::
19258::$$$message_0179_0125_0001$$$::No matter how many deep breaths I take, my heart won't stop pounding.[lr]::
19259::$$$message_0179_0125_0002$$$::It's warning me that it's at its limit. It needs rest. My heart is ready to burst if I don't rest. That's how rapidly it's thumping in my chest. It's all but jumping out of my mouth at this point.::
19260::$$$message_0179_0126_0000$$$::"Ku...ha...haaa...a...aaah."[lr]::
19261::$$$message_0179_0126_0001$$$::I can't do anything.[lr]::
19262::$$$message_0179_0126_0002$$$::I can't get near Kotomine and I can't stop that black mud.[lr]::
19263::$$$message_0179_0126_0003$$$::There's not enough time for me to hold back about using Projection; it's my only hope.::
19264::$$$message_0179_0127_0000$$$::If there's no way forward, I just have to Project Saber's sword again.[lr]::
19265::$$$message_0179_0127_0001$$$::It should be able to cut through that black mud and give me a chance to rush Kotomine.::
19266::$$$message_0179_0128_0000$$$::"Hm? Is that all? If you've given up, say so."[lr]::
19267::$$$message_0179_0128_0001$$$::The moment he speaks...[lr]::
19268::$$$message_0179_0128_0002$$$::"Ha...ah..ha!?"[lr]::
19269::$$$message_0179_0128_0003$$$::A tidal wave of mud crashes over me.::
19270::$$$message_0179_0129_0000$$$::"Kngh!"[lr]::
19271::$$$message_0179_0129_0001$$$::I look up just in time to dodge.[lr]::
19272::$$$message_0179_0129_0002$$$::The mud itself isn't bad.[lr]::
19273::$$$message_0179_0129_0003$$$::It's slow compared to Saber's strikes when we sparred, and it doesn't change direction so it's easy to dodge.::
19274::$$$message_0179_0130_0000$$$::But that only applies when there's just one tentacle.[lr]::
19275::$$$message_0179_0130_0001$$$::I can't handle multiple attacks at once, or those that strike from behind as soon as I've dodged another.[lr]::
19276::$$$message_0179_0130_0002$$$::As a result, I can only move around, and still, mud slowly covers me.::
19277::$$$message_0179_0131_0000$$$::"Ha...get away!"[lr]::
19278::$$$message_0179_0131_0001$$$::There's no time to rest.[lr]::
19279::$$$message_0179_0131_0002$$$::I'm not going to be able to use my Projection.[lr]::
19280::$$$message_0179_0131_0003$$$::Projection requires me to form an image of a weapon from the very beginning, so I need at least a full minute of concentration.[lr]::
19281::$$$message_0179_0131_0004$$$::But if I give Kotomine an opening like that, the only thing left of me will be smoking bones.::
19282::$$$message_0179_0132_0000$$$::"Hah...ha...ha...ha...ha...ah...!"[lr]::
19283::$$$message_0179_0132_0001$$$::Everywhere the mud touches me, I go numb.[lr]::
19284::$$$message_0179_0132_0002$$$::At least it's not painful, but if that mud covers my entire body, I might not even know whether I'm dead or alive.[lr]::
19285::$$$message_0179_0132_0003$$$::If that happens, I'm a goner. I'd melt away...bones and all.::
19286::$$$message_0179_0133_0000$$$::"Ha...haaa...ha...ha...ha!"[lr]::
19287::$$$message_0179_0133_0001$$$::I can only run.[lr]::
19288::$$$message_0179_0133_0002$$$::I know it's only a matter of time until I run out of steam, but I have to keep running for now.[lr]::
19289::$$$message_0179_0133_0003$$$::I have no chance of reaching Kotomine while all I'm doing is avoiding the mud.[lr]::
19290::$$$message_0179_0133_0004$$$::The mud pours like a waterfall behind him, so trying that way isn't an option either.::
19291::$$$message_0179_0134_0000$$$::If I'm going to have any chance of getting near him, I have to do something about this mud...[lr]::
19292::$$$message_0179_0134_0001$$$::"Ow...tsh...ah!?"::
19293::$$$message_0179_0135_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
19294::$$$message_0179_0135_0001$$$::I-I can't believe it! I pick now, of all times, to trip!?::
19295::$$$message_0179_0136_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19296::$$$message_0179_0136_0001$$$::Kotomine stares down at me as if I were a piece of trash.[lr]::
19297::$$$message_0179_0136_0002$$$::He points a finger at me, and several snake heads rear up from the lake.::
19298::$$$message_0179_0137_0000$$$::"What the...!?"[lr]::
19299::$$$message_0179_0137_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Get up.[font italic=false][lr]::
19300::$$$message_0179_0137_0002$$$::I try to get up, but fall again.[lr]::
19301::$$$message_0179_0137_0003$$$::"...Eh?"::
19302::$$$message_0179_0138_0000$$$::I fall.[lr]::
19303::$$$message_0179_0138_0001$$$::I fall.[lr]::
19304::$$$message_0179_0138_0002$$$::The snakes pursue me.::
19305::$$$message_0179_0139_0000$$$::But I still fall.[lr]::
19306::$$$message_0179_0139_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Why?[font italic=false][lr]::
19307::$$$message_0179_0139_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Why?[font italic=false][lr]::

19309::$$$message_0179_0139_0004$$$::Black mud splashes over the back of my neck.[lr]::
19310::$$$message_0179_0139_0005$$$::[font italic=true]Why?[font italic=false][lr]::
19311::$$$message_0179_0139_0006$$$::Now that I look closer...[lr]::
19312::$$$message_0179_0139_0007$$$::...my right leg is entirely black.::
19313::$$$message_0179_0140_0000$$$::"This ends here.[lr]::
19314::$$$message_0179_0140_0001$$$::I expected this to be more entertaining, but you [font italic=true]are[font italic=false] Kiritsugu's son. What a disappointment you turned out to be."[lr]::
19315::$$$message_0179_0140_0002$$$::"Wha...!?"::
19316::$$$message_0179_0141_0000$$$::I look up.[lr]::
19317::$$$message_0179_0141_0001$$$::I'm still conscious.[lr]::
19318::$$$message_0179_0141_0002$$$::My wrists and neck are bound in chains of mud, but I can still feel my body.::
19319::$$$message_0179_0142_0000$$$::"Why...don't you finish me off?"[lr]::
19320::$$$message_0179_0142_0001$$$::"Soon. But that would be in poor taste. You are Kiritsugu's shadow, so the debt he owes me from ten years ago will be repaid with your death."::
19321::$$$message_0179_0143_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
19322::$$$message_0179_0143_0001$$$::My skin burns where the mud touches it.[lr]::
19323::$$$message_0179_0143_0002$$$::It feels like acid is seeping from my pores.[lr]::
19324::$$$message_0179_0143_0003$$$::I grit my teeth, trying to endure the pain, and check my right leg.::
19325::$$$message_0179_0144_0000$$$::It's completely black.[lr]::
19326::$$$message_0179_0144_0001$$$::I can't feel it and it won't move. I need to either get this mud out of me, or pour magical energy through the affected areas to push out the coagulated blood.[lr]::
19327::$$$message_0179_0144_0002$$$::Either way, the moment I try to move my right leg, I'll probably tear off every muscle in it.::
19328::$$$message_0179_0145_0000$$$::"Fine. I don't care. But why do you hate Kiritsugu so much? Did him destroying the Holy Grail get to you that much?"::
19329::$$$message_0179_0146_0000$$$::"Oh, it's nothing serious. My hatred stems from our kinship. Everything he did struck a nerve. It's not unlike your feelings of disgust for me."::
19330::$$$message_0179_0147_0000$$$::"Wha...cut the crap! Don't you dare say that Kiritsugu and you are similar!"::
19331::$$$message_0179_0148_0000$$$::"I see. I suppose saying that [font italic=true]would[font italic=false] enrage you, yes.[lr]::
19332::$$$message_0179_0148_0001$$$::He was [font italic=true]such[font italic=false] a virtuous man, letting someone like me go.[lr]::
19333::$$$message_0179_0148_0002$$$::Even after I caused that great fire, he only bothered to defeat me, not kill me.[lr]::
19334::$$$message_0179_0148_0003$$$::And now you know what a mistake that was.[lr]::
19335::$$$message_0179_0148_0004$$$::If only Kiritsugu had killed me, those orphans would be living peaceful lives as we speak."::
19336::$$$message_0179_0149_0000$$$::"You...!"[lr]::
19337::$$$message_0179_0149_0001$$$::"You know there's no retort to that. I find it unpalatable as well, though.[lr]::
19338::$$$message_0179_0149_0002$$$::As ruthless a mage as him showing compassion and helping his enemy? I find it offensive."::
19339::$$$message_0179_0150_0000$$$::That story again.[lr]::
19340::$$$message_0179_0150_0001$$$::Saber told me before that Kiritsugu was a first-class mage, and he would do anything to accomplish his goals.[lr]::
19341::$$$message_0179_0150_0002$$$::But then...::
19342::$$$message_0179_0151_0000$$$::"But that was not his mistake.[lr]::
19343::$$$message_0179_0151_0001$$$::His mistake was thinking that the war would end with the destruction of the Holy Grail.[lr]::
19344::$$$message_0179_0151_0002$$$::He never told you anything because, in his foolish optimism, he believed the Holy Grail War had ended, and his life came to an end as the curse ate away at him."::
19345::$$$message_0179_0152_0000$$$::"What a fool he was. He cursed himself and let me go, then died only a few years later.[lr]::
19346::$$$message_0179_0152_0001$$$::He believed he accomplished something. He believed he ended the Holy Grail War. Deluded fool."::
19347::$$$message_0179_0153_0000$$$::"Why...you...!"[lr]::
19348::$$$message_0179_0153_0001$$$::Hold on.[lr]::
19349::$$$message_0179_0153_0002$$$::Does that mean...[lr]::
19350::$$$message_0179_0153_0003$$$::Kiritsugu died because of Kotomine?[lr]::
19351::$$$message_0179_0153_0004$$$::What did the peaceful face he had on the night of his death mean?::
19352::$$$message_0179_0154_0000$$$::"Oh, yes. Let me ask you one last thing.[lr]::
19353::$$$message_0179_0154_0001$$$::Tell me of Kiritsugu's final moments. Did he pass on something to you, his son? Did he croak satisfactorily?[lr]::
19354::$$$message_0179_0154_0002$$$::Heh. The utter cretin.[lr]::
19355::$$$message_0179_0154_0003$$$::He accomplished nothing at all, and simply put all the responsibility on you. I bet his death was absolutely comical!"::
