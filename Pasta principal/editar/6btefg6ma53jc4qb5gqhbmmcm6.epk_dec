37378::$$$message_0318_0000_0000$$$::Yay, bomb voyage!::
37379::$$$message_0318_0000_0001$$$::Ahhh! DEATH, GOTH, MOS-KOS!::
37380::$$$message_0318_0000_0002$$$::Now, it only takes a second to be careful, but an injury can last for a lifetime. Did this ending teach you that it's not a good idea to just ask anyone anything?::
37381::$$$message_0318_0000_0003$$$::Yes, ma'am! It was such an irrational and sudden death. This is totally [font italic=true]Fate[font italic=false] and absolutely awesome, master!::
37382::$$$message_0318_0000_0004$$$::Yes. But we cannot forget these sacrifices![lr]::
37383::$$$message_0318_0000_0005$$$::Let us give a three-second moment of silence for Ryudou!::
37384::$$$message_0318_0000_0006$$$::Yes! I love how it's only three seconds, master!::
37385::$$$message_0318_0000_0007$$$::So, Illya. What is going on with the people at Ryudou Temple?::
37386::$$$message_0318_0000_0008$$$::Hmm, they have something like an artificial Command Spell put on them by Caster.::
37387::$$$message_0318_0000_0009$$$::If they come across someone who breaks her three rules, they become similar to a doll that carries out only one command.::
37388::$$$message_0318_0000_0010$$$::She's good at making tools. If she ever captures Shirou, I bet she would turn him into a specialized Mystic Code that assists her with magecraft.::
37389::$$$message_0318_0000_0011$$$::Evil! Caster is evil![lr]::
37390::$$$message_0318_0000_0012$$$::As an educator, I can't forgive anyone who uses others as they wish!::
37391::$$$message_0318_0000_0013$$$::...I don't know about calling her evil just because of that.::
37392::$$$message_0318_0000_0014$$$::Caster is weak, cowardly, and sly, but she's not fully bad on the inside.::
37393::$$$message_0318_0000_0015$$$::Hm? Why are you sticking up for that witch, student number one...?[lr]::
37394::$$$message_0318_0000_0016$$$::Do you have something on your mind?::
37395::$$$message_0318_0000_0017$$$::Huh...? N-no, not really.[lr]::
37396::$$$message_0318_0000_0018$$$::I just wanted to say that it's not always bad to bind someone with magecraft.::
37397::$$$message_0318_0000_0019$$$::Oh, I remember. You've done worse to Shirou!::
37398::$$$message_0318_0000_0020$$$::Damn it, you found out, you motherf[line2]!::
37399::$$$message_0318_0000_0021$$$::Ouu... I can't beat that sword for some reason.::
37400::$$$message_0318_0000_0022$$$::Of course, magecraft isn't allowed in this dojo.[lr]::
37401::$$$message_0318_0000_0023$$$::You have to bring a wild lion or a modern weapon to beat me.::
37402::$$$message_0318_0000_0024$$$::Now, will you repent for your actions?::
37403::$$$message_0318_0000_0025$$$::...Yes, I apologize.[lr]::
37404::$$$message_0318_0000_0026$$$::I won't do anything bad again.::
37405::$$$message_0318_0000_0027$$$::Yes, that's a good girl! The boy's wish is granted as well! Rejoice little bro, Illya is more behaved in this route!::
37406::$$$message_0318_0000_0028$$$::All right, all right. I just have to behave this time, right?::
37407::$$$message_0318_0000_0029$$$::...Well, it's not fun to always be on a rampage. I can even help Shirou in this route and take one of the heroine roles.::
37408::$$$message_0318_0000_0030$$$::Wha[line2]You put that much thought into this...!?[lr]::
37409::$$$message_0318_0000_0031$$$::As if that illegal costume isn't enough, you're even taking on such a great role in the main storyline...!::
37410::$$$message_0318_0000_0032$$$::Illya... Such a scary child...!::
