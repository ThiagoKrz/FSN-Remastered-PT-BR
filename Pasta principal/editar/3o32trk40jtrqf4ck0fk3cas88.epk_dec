12375::$$$message_0124_0000_0000$$$::We reach a clearing in the forest.[lr]::
12376::$$$message_0124_0000_0001$$$::The sun is rising and a white layer of morning mist blankets the forest.[lr]::
12377::$$$message_0124_0000_0002$$$::Compared to the much denser forest around us, this is a good vantage point.::
12378::$$$message_0124_0001_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. This place doesn't seem bad."[lr]::
12379::$$$message_0124_0001_0001$$$::"Yes. It meets most of our conditions, but it might actually be too open. I should be able to escape, but it might be tough for you and Saber."::
12380::$$$message_0124_0002_0000$$$::"Hm..."[lr]::
12381::$$$message_0124_0002_0001$$$::Tohsaka is such a perfectionist if she's even considering escape routes.::
12382::$$$message_0124_0003_0000$$$::"Let's try somewhere else. We still have some time."[lr]::
12383::$$$message_0124_0003_0001$$$::Tohsaka returns to the forest.[lr]::
12384::$$$message_0124_0003_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
12385::$$$message_0124_0003_0003$$$::But Saber stands motionless, staring off into the distance.::
12386::$$$message_0124_0004_0000$$$::"Saber? What are you doing? We need to hurry or else Illyasviel's going to[line2]"::
12387::$$$message_0124_0005_0000$$$::A chill runs up my spine.[lr]::
12388::$$$message_0124_0005_0001$$$::I could never forget this feeling.[lr]::
12389::$$$message_0124_0005_0002$$$::I can't see him or feel his presence.[lr]::
12390::$$$message_0124_0005_0003$$$::But the sudden weight of the air pressing down around me is definitely coming from HIM.::
12391::$$$message_0124_0006_0000$$$::                                               [font italic=true]Fufu... I found you.[font italic=false]::
12392::$$$message_0124_0007_0000$$$::Illya's voice echoes from somewhere in the forest.[lr]::
12393::$$$message_0124_0007_0001$$$::Beyond the mist...[lr]::
12394::$$$message_0124_0007_0002$$$::...from deeper in the forest, a dark figure approaches.::
12395::$$$message_0124_0008_0000$$$::   [font italic=true]Wait right there. I'm coming to kill you.[font italic=false]::
12396::$$$message_0124_0009_0000$$$::Maybe it's because we're in a clearing with an open view of the sky...[lr]::
12397::$$$message_0124_0009_0001$$$::...but it feels like Illya is peeking down at us from up in the clouds.::
12398::$$$message_0124_0010_0000$$$::"Crap. Did she find Shirou already!?[lr]::
12399::$$$message_0124_0010_0001$$$::This isn't good. This place is too wide open! And how fast is she!? We have less than two minutes until she...!"::
12400::$$$message_0124_0011_0000$$$::"Hey! What are you two waiting for!?[lr]::
12401::$$$message_0124_0011_0001$$$::I keep telling you this is a bad spot. We need to get somewhere else, fast!"[lr]::
12402::$$$message_0124_0011_0002$$$::Tohsaka grabs our hands.[lr]::
12403::$$$message_0124_0011_0003$$$::   But it's too late.::
12404::$$$message_0124_0012_0000$$$::"No. This is fine, Tohsaka.[lr]::
12405::$$$message_0124_0012_0001$$$::We're lucky enough that the three of us are able to fight together. We can't ask for anything more."::
12406::$$$message_0124_0013_0000$$$::"You dummy! That's exactly the problem! It's way too open here! Saber can't handle Berserker alone, and you can't get out of his range to support her here!"::
12407::$$$message_0124_0014_0000$$$::"I know you're concerned for me, but we're all in danger here. Besides, we can't escape now anyway."[lr]::
12408::$$$message_0124_0014_0001$$$::"Ugh.. That's...true, but..."::
12409::$$$message_0124_0015_0000$$$::"Are you ready, Saber? We're fighting Berserker here."[lr]::
12410::$$$message_0124_0015_0001$$$::Saber nods quietly.[lr]::
12411::$$$message_0124_0015_0002$$$::"Oh come on! Fine! I'll be really ticked if you two get thrashed!"::
12412::$$$message_0124_0016_0000$$$::Tohsaka, apparently convinced, disappears into the mist.[lr]::
12413::$$$message_0124_0016_0001$$$::Once she goes into action, she acts quickly.[lr]::
12414::$$$message_0124_0016_0002$$$::She darts into the forest and then scrambles up a tree.::
12415::$$$message_0124_0017_0000$$$::"They're coming, Saber. Are you ready?"[lr]::
12416::$$$message_0124_0017_0001$$$::"I should ask you the same. Once the battle begins, please do not move past this point. I will not let Berserker near this spot."::
12417::$$$message_0124_0018_0000$$$::The mist wavers.[lr]::
12418::$$$message_0124_0018_0001$$$::Out of the morning fog...[lr]::
12419::$$$message_0124_0018_0002$$$::...a dark shadow spreads across the clearing. A mad warrior, led by a pale girl, steps into view.::
12420::$$$message_0124_0019_0000$$$::"This is a surprise. I thought you were going to flee until the end. Or have you given up, brother?"[lr]::
12421::$$$message_0124_0019_0001$$$::Illya's about forty meters from me.[lr]::
12422::$$$message_0124_0019_0002$$$::We face each other from opposite ends of the clearing.::
12423::$$$message_0124_0020_0000$$$::"Oh. So Saber got better. That must be why you stopped running.[lr]::
12424::$$$message_0124_0020_0001$$$::What a shame. It's cute that you think it'll be enough to beat me though.[lr]::
12425::$$$message_0124_0020_0002$$$::Sorry...you're going to die here."::
12426::$$$message_0124_0021_0000$$$::Her giggles echo in the forest.[lr]::
12427::$$$message_0124_0021_0001$$$::Apparently that ticks her off.[lr]::
12428::$$$message_0124_0021_0002$$$::Saber, still standing beside me, is practically vibrating with animosity. She might launch herself forward at any moment.::
12429::$$$message_0124_0022_0000$$$::"Oh, you're all quiet now. You're so boring. Are you scared of dying? What a waste. If you beg for your life, maybe I'll consider sparing you."::
12430::$$$message_0124_0023_0000$$$::Tohsaka's probably in position.[lr]::
12431::$$$message_0124_0023_0001$$$::She'll probably want to be as close to the center of the clearing as she can.[lr]::
12432::$$$message_0124_0023_0002$$$::There's a spot where the tree branches overlap. It should be sturdy enough to support her weight.::
12433::$$$message_0124_0024_0000$$$::"I see. So that's how it's going to be. Enough chatter then. I'll kill you and Ri[line2][lr]::
12434::$$$message_0124_0024_0001$$$::Wait. Where's Rin, Shirou?"::
12435::$$$message_0124_0025_0000$$$::I have to give it to Berserker's Master.[lr]::
12436::$$$message_0124_0025_0001$$$::She knows better than to overlook any details.::
12437::$$$message_0124_0026_0000$$$::"Tohsaka's gone. We stopped working together a while ago."::
12438::$$$message_0124_0027_0000$$$::"So you two split up? That figures. You and Saber could only drag her down. She should be able to do pretty well on her own."::
12439::$$$message_0124_0028_0000$$$::"Well, there you go. She's probably out of the forest by now. I doubt you'll catch up to her even if you go after her right now."::
12440::$$$message_0124_0029_0000$$$::"Oh, you think so? This forest is an Einzbern Bounded Field.[lr]::
12441::$$$message_0124_0029_0001$$$::I always know the instant someone enters or leaves. Nobody's left, so Rin's still in the forest. I have plenty of time to deal with her once I've taken care of you."::
12442::$$$message_0124_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
12443::$$$message_0124_0030_0001$$$::That's a relief.[lr]::
12444::$$$message_0124_0030_0002$$$::If Illya only detects who's going in and out of the forest, then she doesn't know where Tohsaka is now.[lr]::
12445::$$$message_0124_0030_0003$$$::That, and she believed my story pretty easily.[lr]::
12446::$$$message_0124_0030_0004$$$::Illya is a truly merciless Master.[lr]::
12447::$$$message_0124_0030_0005$$$::But...is she too merciless to have a chance to start over?::
12448::$$$message_0124_0031_0000$$$::"Illya, before we fight, there's something I want to ask you.[lr]::
12449::$$$message_0124_0031_0001$$$::Would you consider quitting being a Master, and ending this battle?"::
12450::$$$message_0124_0032_0000$$$::"I can't. This is Grandfather's command.[lr]::
12451::$$$message_0124_0032_0001$$$::As long as Berserker's around, I'm a Master of the Einzberns. I need to kill other Masters and bring home the Holy Grail."::
12452::$$$message_0124_0033_0000$$$::"But I'm the one who should be asking [font italic=true]you[font italic=false] a question.[lr]::
12453::$$$message_0124_0033_0001$$$::I'm the head of the Einzbern household, so I'm not going to repeat what I said earlier. But I might reconsider if you're willing to change your answer."::
12454::$$$message_0124_0034_0000$$$::...She sounds almost hopeful.[lr]::
12455::$$$message_0124_0034_0001$$$::But as long as I have Saber with me, I can't agree to what she's asking.::
12456::$$$message_0124_0035_0000$$$::"My answer is unchanged. I'm Saber's Master.[lr]::
12457::$$$message_0124_0035_0001$$$::If you're not going to quit being a Master, I'll defeat Berserker and [font italic=true]make[font italic=false] you quit."[lr]::
12458::$$$message_0124_0035_0002$$$::I look at both Illya and Berserker and say that.[lr]::
12459::$$$message_0124_0035_0003$$$::In that instant...[lr]::
12460::$$$message_0124_0035_0004$$$::The air in the clearing tenses with a sharp, snapping sound.::
12461::$$$message_0124_0036_0000$$$::"I see. Then I'm going to kill you now.[lr]::
12462::$$$message_0124_0036_0001$$$::I'm going to annihilate you...right down to that conceited head of yours...!"::
12463::$$$message_0124_0037_0000$$$::"Wha...!"[lr]::
12464::$$$message_0124_0037_0001$$$::What the heck's that?[lr]::
12465::$$$message_0124_0037_0002$$$::There's some sort of inscription appearing on Illya's face.[lr]::
12466::$$$message_0124_0037_0003$$$::   No, it's not just her face.[lr]::
12467::$$$message_0124_0037_0004$$$::It's a huge Command Spell covering her entire body, and I can even see it at this distance... It's so much more massive than the ones we have.::
12468::$$$message_0124_0038_0000$$$::"Playtime is over. Trample them, Heracles."[lr]::
12469::$$$message_0124_0038_0001$$$::Illya's voice is completely lifeless.[lr]::
12470::$$$message_0124_0038_0002$$$::And in response, the giant behind her howls.::
12471::$$$message_0124_0039_0000$$$::[wacky len=12][lr]::
12472::$$$message_0124_0039_0001$$$::His roar shakes the earth.[lr]::
12473::$$$message_0124_0039_0002$$$::He screams and thrashes like he's lost his mind. His abilities grow even more powerful, like his body is swelling with deformed masses.::
12474::$$$message_0124_0040_0000$$$::"That is impossible. Was she only depriving him of reason rather than letting him go berserk!?"[lr]::
12475::$$$message_0124_0040_0001$$$::I'm not surprised Saber is shuddering.[lr]::
12476::$$$message_0124_0040_0002$$$::Even I, who can't gauge the warrior's strength, can tell I shouldn't be getting anywhere near that monster.::
12477::$$$message_0124_0041_0000$$$::"Go! Kill everything you see, Berserker!"[lr]::
12478::$$$message_0124_0041_0001$$$::[wacky len=12]!!![lr]::
12479::$$$message_0124_0041_0002$$$::The air explodes.[lr]::
12480::$$$message_0124_0041_0003$$$::The giant bellows a roar so different from its anguished wail...and leaps.::
12481::$$$message_0124_0042_0000$$$::"Saber!!!"[lr]::
12482::$$$message_0124_0042_0001$$$::A streak of silver surges forward in answer.[lr]::
12483::$$$message_0124_0042_0002$$$::Berserker lands in the middle of the clearing.::
12484::$$$message_0124_0043_0000$$$::   The earth shakes.[lr]::
12485::$$$message_0124_0043_0001$$$::Saber intercepts Berserker as if stopping a falling meteor.::
12486::$$$message_0124_0044_0000$$$::It's like watching a mythical battle unfolding in front of me.::
12487::$$$message_0124_0045_0000$$$::In a forest shrouded by morning mist, two shadows clash relentlessly.[lr]::
12488::$$$message_0124_0045_0001$$$::Berserker is simply overwhelming.::
12489::$$$message_0124_0046_0000$$$::Berserker's swipes are like whirlwinds, his downward strikes like waterfalls. Even Saber wouldn't survive a direct hit.::
12490::$$$message_0124_0047_0000$$$::But Saber deflects his every attack without faltering or hesitating.[lr]::
12491::$$$message_0124_0047_0001$$$::She swipes aside the barrage of strikes raining on her like a raging storm.::
12492::$$$message_0124_0048_0000$$$::To fail would mean being cut down on the spot.[lr]::
12493::$$$message_0124_0048_0001$$$::To Saber, each of the rapid blows seemed to strike with her opponent's full might.::
12494::$$$message_0124_0049_0000$$$::The clash of swords echoes around the clearing.[lr]::
12495::$$$message_0124_0049_0001$$$::Berserker has greater reach.[lr]::
12496::$$$message_0124_0049_0002$$$::Berserker is faster.[lr]::
12497::$$$message_0124_0049_0003$$$::Berserker has more stamina.::
12498::$$$message_0124_0050_0000$$$::All Saber can do is parry the titanic surges of wind from Berserker's swings to mitigate the sheer strength, all just to avoid being cut in half.::
12499::$$$message_0124_0051_0000$$$::Berserker is like a broken jackhammer.[lr]::
12500::$$$message_0124_0051_0001$$$::His blade spins in all directions, annihilating everything in its path.[lr]::
12501::$$$message_0124_0051_0002$$$::Just getting in reach could only be fatal.[lr]::
12502::$$$message_0124_0051_0003$$$::There would be no hope of escape. They'd get caught in that whirling blade and ground to dust.::
12503::$$$message_0124_0052_0000$$$::No normal human would have a chance against that.[lr]::
12504::$$$message_0124_0052_0001$$$::And if getting close can only mean death, then the only option is fleeing.[lr]::
12505::$$$message_0124_0052_0002$$$::But Saber steps into the whirlwind and doesn't retreat.::
12506::$$$message_0124_0053_0000$$$::She'll be shredded to pieces.[lr]::
12507::$$$message_0124_0053_0001$$$::The sword sparks off of her, slowly chipping her armor away.[lr]::
12508::$$$message_0124_0053_0002$$$::Standing in the middle of that vortex, she could be dead in a heartbeat.::
12509::$$$message_0124_0054_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
12510::$$$message_0124_0054_0001$$$::I can only hold my breath.[lr]::
12511::$$$message_0124_0054_0002$$$::In ancient times...[lr]::
12512::$$$message_0124_0054_0003$$$::...heroes who fought dragons and Demonic Beasts...must have all been like this. Like her.::
12513::$$$message_0124_0055_0000$$$::They know perfectly well how vast the gap in strength between them is.[lr]::
12514::$$$message_0124_0055_0001$$$::But they bet everything on a one-in-a-million shot.::
12515::$$$message_0124_0056_0000$$$::A seething mass of violence beyond anything humans are capable of...[lr]::
12516::$$$message_0124_0056_0001$$$::They just defended until a single opportunity presented itself... Many warriors died without ever seeing the miracle they were waiting for.[lr]::
12517::$$$message_0124_0056_0002$$$::That's exactly what this battle is.[lr]::
12518::$$$message_0124_0056_0003$$$::It is a glamorous, eye-catching battle. But...[lr]::
12519::$$$message_0124_0056_0004$$$::...it only ends one way: with Saber's defeat. Each blow chips away a little more at her.::
12520::$$$message_0124_0057_0000$$$::[wacky len=12][lr]::
12521::$$$message_0124_0057_0001$$$::Berserker's roar shakes the ground.[lr]::
12522::$$$message_0124_0057_0002$$$::The sheer whirlwind of his frenzy churns up the atmosphere and sends Saber flying as she tries to defend.[lr]::
12523::$$$message_0124_0057_0003$$$::Every time Berserker's attacks chip away a bit of Saber's armor, she's thrown to the ground. But instead of remaining down or on her knees, Saber charges right back at Berserker every time.::
12524::$$$message_0124_0058_0000$$$::...But she's at her limit.[lr]::
12525::$$$message_0124_0058_0001$$$::Saber's breathing is labored, and her movements are visibly slowing.[lr]::
12526::$$$message_0124_0058_0002$$$::There won't be any opening.[lr]::
12527::$$$message_0124_0058_0003$$$::In a few moments, Berserker's titanic weapon will shatter Saber's sword.::
12528::$$$message_0124_0059_0000$$$::"...Ngh!"[lr]::
12529::$$$message_0124_0059_0001$$$::I grip the bow I made.[lr]::
12530::$$$message_0124_0059_0002$$$::I'm going to...![lr]ÏPÏo
