75856::$$$message_0700_0000_0001$$$::"W-why? Rin is violent, greedy, and as loud as a mynah. But you still want to be with her? Is that what you're into?"::
75857::$$$message_0700_0001_0000$$$::"No, it's not like that, Illya.[lr]::
75858::$$$message_0700_0001_0001$$$::This is about whether I'll obey her orders, and I'm willing to. I can't stop Zouken on my own, and I'm only alive thanks to Archer."::

75860::$$$message_0700_0003_0000$$$::"I'll let Tohsaka give me orders. That makes me no different from a Servant, right? She can treat me like one if that's what she wants."[lr]::

75865::$$$message_0700_0005_0001$$$::My Archer left his unfinished work to you, so we're in the same boat now. I'll work you hard to pay back that debt."[lr]::
75866::$$$message_0700_0005_0002$$$::"Of course. I can't sleep at night unless I properly pay back my debts."::
75867::$$$message_0700_0006_0000$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
75868::$$$message_0700_0006_0001$$$::No matter what our history is, I have a new left arm thanks to Archer.[lr]::
75869::$$$message_0700_0006_0002$$$::If he passed on while he still had his pact with Tohsaka,[lr]::
75870::$$$message_0700_0006_0003$$$::then it isn't wrong of me to inherit the promise he couldn't keep to her.::
