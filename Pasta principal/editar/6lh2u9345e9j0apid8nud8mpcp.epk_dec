61887::$$$message_0566_0000_0000$$$::   Let's patrol Miyama.[lr]::
61888::$$$message_0566_0000_0001$$$::I do want to secure our home turf, but more importantly, Miyama doesn't have as many people as Shinto.[lr]::
61889::$$$message_0566_0000_0002$$$::I'm worried about what might happen to the helpless residents if they run into a Servant lurking in the night. They might fall victim without anyone even knowing they're gone.::
61890::$$$message_0566_0001_0000$$$::"We'll check out the neighborhoods tonight... This is Tohsaka's territory, so it isn't easy for other Masters to operate here, but I just want to be careful."[lr]::
61891::$$$message_0566_0001_0001$$$::"Understood. I have already ascertained that there are no enemies nearby, so let us investigate the hills yonder."::
61892::$$$message_0566_0002_0000$$$::By yonder, she must mean the European-style neighborhoods.[lr]::
61893::$$$message_0566_0002_0001$$$::Saber must have taken it upon herself to check out the area around our house while I was at school yesterday.::
61894::$$$message_0566_0003_0000$$$::"Shirou? Aren't we going out on patrol?"[lr]::
61895::$$$message_0566_0003_0001$$$::"Y-yeah. Come with me, Saber."::
61896::$$$message_0566_0004_0000$$$::I turn off the living room lights.[lr]::
61897::$$$message_0566_0004_0001$$$::So as not to wake Sakura, I slip out of the house as quietly as I can.::
61898::$$$message_0566_0005_0000$$$::...We fail to turn up anything out of the ordinary in Miyama.[lr]::
61899::$$$message_0566_0005_0001$$$::I went to the Matou house just in case, but the grounds were quiet, and we couldn't pick up any traces of Servants or magical energy.::
61900::$$$message_0566_0006_0000$$$::"...Nothing seems particularly amiss. It has been one day since Caster was eliminated. I suppose the other Masters must be monitoring the situation as well."[lr]::
61901::$$$message_0566_0006_0001$$$::"...Yeah. I hope so."::
61902::$$$message_0566_0007_0000$$$::According to Saber, most of the magical threads that Caster had spread throughout town have disappeared.[lr]::
61903::$$$message_0566_0007_0001$$$::There isn't a Master draining magical energy from people in the city anymore.[lr]::
61904::$$$message_0566_0007_0002$$$::So...what is this vague sense of anxiety?::
61905::$$$message_0566_0008_0000$$$::The town is quiet.[lr]::
61906::$$$message_0566_0008_0001$$$::Not a soul is out on the streets.[lr]::
61907::$$$message_0566_0008_0002$$$::It was quiet yesterday night too, but the town feels so cold and devoid of life that it's like looking at a still painting.::
61908::$$$message_0566_0009_0000$$$::"Let us return, Shirou. There is nothing of note here.[lr]::
61909::$$$message_0566_0009_0001$$$::You seem unwell, so you should rest tonight."[lr]::
61910::$$$message_0566_0009_0002$$$::"Ah...yeah, you're right. It's almost midnight, too. Let's head back."[lr]::
61911::$$$message_0566_0009_0003$$$::At Saber's urging, we take the path back up the hill.::
61912::$$$message_0566_0010_0000$$$::...It's a quiet town.[lr]::
61913::$$$message_0566_0010_0001$$$::The dark sky smothers everything, as if the moon were frozen solid.:yg
