32059::$$$message_0258_0000_0000$$$::Tohsaka is right.[lr]::
32060::$$$message_0258_0000_0001$$$::Saber risked her life to draw Berserker away.[lr]::
32061::$$$message_0258_0000_0002$$$::I need to escape from here and wait for Saber to return.::
32062::$$$message_0258_0001_0000$$$::"Haah... Haah... Haah..."[lr]::
32063::$$$message_0258_0001_0001$$$::I hurry across the bridge from Shinto and run home.[lr]::
32064::$$$message_0258_0001_0002$$$::I never once look back.[lr]::
32065::$$$message_0258_0001_0003$$$::Whether out of fear of a nonexistent pursuer or guilt over leaving Saber behind, I'm not sure.[lr]::
32066::$$$message_0258_0001_0004$$$::Either way, I run for my life, my eyes fixed on the road ahead of me.::
32067::$$$message_0258_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32068::$$$message_0258_0002_0001$$$::...The living room is just as I left it.[lr]::
32069::$$$message_0258_0002_0002$$$::The air has remained still since Lancer's attack and Tohsaka coming over.[lr]::
32070::$$$message_0258_0002_0003$$$::I go over to the repaired window.[lr]::
32071::$$$message_0258_0002_0004$$$::I find two small pieces of glass on the floor. Tohsaka must have missed them.::
32072::$$$message_0258_0003_0000$$$::"...There's no crack in the window... I wonder how she made up for the missing pieces."[lr]::
32073::$$$message_0258_0003_0001$$$::I mutter to myself.[lr]::
32074::$$$message_0258_0003_0002$$$::...For some reason, I don't feel like turning on the light.[lr]::
32075::$$$message_0258_0003_0003$$$::I hide in the darkness as if to conceal my weakness.::
32076::$$$message_0258_0004_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
32077::$$$message_0258_0004_0001$$$::What I should be thinking about...[lr]::
32078::$$$message_0258_0004_0002$$$::What I should be saying... I'm running away from these things.[lr]::
32079::$$$message_0258_0004_0003$$$::...The person who was here in this room until a few hours ago.[lr]::
32080::$$$message_0258_0004_0004$$$::The person who was beside me until a few minutes ago.[lr]::
32081::$$$message_0258_0004_0005$$$::I should be asking myself whether it was right to leave those two behind, but I can't seem to do anything but hide in this darkness.::
32082::$$$message_0258_0005_0000$$$::The clock strikes 3 AM.[lr]::
32083::$$$message_0258_0005_0001$$$::...It's been 30 minutes since then.[lr]::
32084::$$$message_0258_0005_0002$$$::Whatever the outcome, the battle's probably over by now.::
32085::$$$message_0258_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
32086::$$$message_0258_0006_0001$$$::I should go back.[lr]::
32087::$$$message_0258_0006_0002$$$::I pull myself together and look up to turn on the light...[lr]::
32088::$$$message_0258_0006_0003$$$::Suddenly, a sharp pain sears the back of my left hand, then disappears.::
32089::$$$message_0258_0007_0000$$$::"...The Command Spell is getting lighter...?"[lr]::
32090::$$$message_0258_0007_0001$$$::The color has faded from the Command Spell.[lr]::
32091::$$$message_0258_0007_0002$$$::The shape remains, but the bright red that proves I am Saber's Master has disappeared.[lr]::
32092::$$$message_0258_0007_0003$$$::I know, instinctively, what that means.[lr]::
32093::$$$message_0258_0007_0004$$$::"No, Saber...!"[lr]::
32094::$$$message_0258_0007_0005$$$::I follow my instincts and run out of the darkness where I've been hiding.::
32095::$$$message_0258_0008_0000$$$::I run outside.[lr]::
32096::$$$message_0258_0008_0001$$$::I know I'm too late.[lr]::
32097::$$$message_0258_0008_0002$$$::Even so, I run as fast as I can back to where I left Saber...[lr]::
32098::$$$message_0258_0008_0003$$$::Something I can't see lashes from ahead and impales my heart.::
32099::$$$message_0258_0009_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
32100::$$$message_0258_0009_0001$$$::...I can't hear too well.[lr]::
32101::$$$message_0258_0009_0002$$$::There's something in front of me. Something's protruding from my chest. I just...can't make out what.::
32102::$$$message_0258_0010_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
32103::$$$message_0258_0010_0001$$$::The...something in front of me sneers and tells me I'm an idiot.[lr]::
32104::$$$message_0258_0010_0002$$$::It's laughing at me and saying there's no reason for me to be alive after I lost my Servant.::
32105::$$$message_0258_0011_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
32106::$$$message_0258_0011_0001$$$::That's right...[lr]::
32107::$$$message_0258_0011_0002$$$::Shirou Emiya dies the moment that he loses Saber.[lr]::
32108::$$$message_0258_0011_0003$$$::Without Saber, I have no means of protecting myself. I can't possibly survive.::
32109::$$$message_0258_0012_0000$$$::I'm all alone now. I hadn't realized it, but I am.[lr]::
32110::$$$message_0258_0012_0001$$$::And this is where that's brought me.[lr]::
32111::$$$message_0258_0012_0002$$$::This would have happened the same whether I was at home, or wherever I might have tried to run.::
32112::$$$message_0258_0013_0000$$$::"Hrrk..."[lr]::
32113::$$$message_0258_0013_0001$$$::My consciousness fades away...[lr]::
32114::$$$message_0258_0013_0002$$$::I don't know who it is, and I don't care whether that thing piercing my heart is a spear or an arrow.[lr]::
32115::$$$message_0258_0013_0003$$$::It doesn't matter whether I die here and now or tomorrow.::
32116::$$$message_0258_0014_0000$$$::Because...[lr]::
32117::$$$message_0258_0014_0001$$$::...now that my Command Spell has faded, my life is essentially over.:(°k
