22533::$$$message_0202_0000_0000$$$::The uncomfortable day passes by in a flurry.[lr]::
22534::$$$message_0202_0000_0001$$$::Saber never laughs, not once during the whole day. So, neither do I.::
22535::$$$message_0202_0001_0000$$$::No part of the day was particularly memorable, but neither was there any painfully boring aspect.[lr]::
22536::$$$message_0202_0001_0001$$$::Basically, nothing significant happened.[lr]::
22537::$$$message_0202_0001_0002$$$::The way it went, maybe Saber would have been happy if we'd stayed in the dojo and trained together.::
22538::$$$message_0202_0002_0000$$$::But today wasn't all that bad either.[lr]::
22539::$$$message_0202_0002_0001$$$::Even if it didn't end up being all that exciting, I should be proud that I at least managed to take Saber around.[lr]::
22540::$$$message_0202_0002_0002$$$::After the war is over and once everything goes back to normal...[lr]::
22541::$$$message_0202_0002_0003$$$::I don't want to look back on all this and realize that all the time I spent with Saber was in combat.::
22542::$$$message_0202_0003_0000$$$::Even if this entire date was stupid, she needs to spend some time doing something other than fighting, or there's no point in her being here.[lr]::
22543::$$$message_0202_0003_0001$$$::So, yeah. I should be proud of myself.[lr]::
22544::$$$message_0202_0003_0002$$$::...The end is near.[lr]::
22545::$$$message_0202_0003_0003$$$::When everything is done, and when there's no need to fight anymore...[lr]::
22546::$$$message_0202_0003_0004$$$::...if Saber can look back on this moment, that's enough for me.::
22547::$$$message_0202_0004_0000$$$::We walk back home.[lr]::
22548::$$$message_0202_0004_0001$$$::Just as we're trying to get on the bus...[lr]::
22549::$$$message_0202_0004_0002$$$::"I would prefer to walk home."[lr]::
22550::$$$message_0202_0004_0003$$$::Saber finally voices a preference.::
22551::$$$message_0202_0005_0000$$$::The winds are picking up.[lr]::
22552::$$$message_0202_0005_0001$$$::The brilliant sun set paints the bridge red.[lr]::
22553::$$$message_0202_0005_0002$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
22554::$$$message_0202_0005_0003$$$::Saber notices something, stops, and looks over the bridge into the river.[lr]::
22555::$$$message_0202_0005_0004$$$::She is looking at a mountain of rubble.::
22556::$$$message_0202_0006_0000$$$::I say it's a mountain, but the pile isn't really that high.[lr]::
22557::$$$message_0202_0006_0001$$$::Steel frames and other things are piled up just a little below the water level, and it's only slightly disturbing the flow of the river.[lr]::
22558::$$$message_0202_0006_0002$$$::I don't know what happened, but some boat probably sank, then pieces of it drifted here.[lr]::
22559::$$$message_0202_0006_0003$$$::I hear some of the neighboring residents have been complaining, trying to get rid of the pile since it's so unsightly.::
22560::$$$message_0202_0007_0000$$$::"What is it, Saber? Did that catch your attention?"[lr]::
22561::$$$message_0202_0007_0001$$$::"It is nothing. I only noticed that it is still there. You see, I caused that. During the previous war, I was forced to do battle over the water, and I had to use my Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
22562::$$$message_0202_0007_0002$$$::The only damages were the river drying up, but unfortunately  it also struck a ship that was anchored there."::
22563::$$$message_0202_0008_0000$$$::"Huh? Struck...with Excalibur?"[lr]::
22564::$$$message_0202_0008_0001$$$::"Y-yes. Fortunately there was nobody on board and the damage was minimal. The river has gone back to normal, so I believe there is nothing to be upset over.[lr]::
22565::$$$message_0202_0008_0002$$$::Well...I feel bad about it, and regret it."::
22566::$$$message_0202_0009_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
22567::$$$message_0202_0009_0001$$$::...I should be more careful.[lr]::
22568::$$$message_0202_0009_0002$$$::When we use Excalibur, I need to be mindful to use it somewhere there's a lot of open space, like out here.::
22569::$$$message_0202_0010_0000$$$::"Shirou? Are you still mad?"::
22570::$$$message_0202_0011_0000$$$::"Eh? No, I'm not mad. I was just surprised. Plus, it's a reminder that there are still remnants from the previous war.[lr]::
22571::$$$message_0202_0011_0001$$$::Compared to the wasteland at the central park, the mound of rubble in this river is nothing...though I guess the ship's owner might not have come out of that so great."::
22572::$$$message_0202_0012_0000$$$::"Please do not worry too much. Kiritsugu said the boat's owner had insurance, and they originally parked the ship with the intention of using it as a cushion to dampen the river's flow. The ship acted as a wall that mitigated the damage from my Noble Phantasm."::
22573::$$$message_0202_0013_0000$$$::"Does that mean you destroyed the ship knowing it was there for that purpose?"::
22574::$$$message_0202_0014_0000$$$::"I was not aware! Kiritsugu had that prepared without my knowing.[lr]::
22575::$$$message_0202_0014_0001$$$::He must have been able to predict how the battle would turn out. I did not know because he did not say a word before or after he prepared the boat."::
22576::$$$message_0202_0015_0000$$$::And then Saber looks down at the river, probably thinking back to that earlier Holy Grail War.[lr]::
22577::$$$message_0202_0015_0001$$$::The surface of the water glitters with reflected sunlight.[lr]::
22578::$$$message_0202_0015_0002$$$::The wind coming from the river flutters Saber's hair.::
22579::$$$message_0202_0016_0000$$$::She's so beautiful...[lr]::
22580::$$$message_0202_0016_0001$$$::"Saber. Did you have fun today?"[lr]::
22581::$$$message_0202_0016_0002$$$::I'm suddenly scared Saber is going to disappear, so I ask a question it's probably better not to voice.::
22582::$$$message_0202_0017_0000$$$::"Come again? Did you say something, Shirou?"[lr]::
22583::$$$message_0202_0017_0001$$$::"I did. I asked if you had fun today."[lr]::
22584::$$$message_0202_0017_0002$$$::I hold my breath.[lr]::
22585::$$$message_0202_0017_0003$$$::Saber looks a little confused.::
22586::$$$message_0202_0018_0000$$$::"Yes. I would be lying if I said none of it was new to me."[lr]::
22587::$$$message_0202_0018_0001$$$::She says it...fondly.[lr]::
22588::$$$message_0202_0018_0002$$$::...Like she knows she'll never have another day like this.::
22589::$$$message_0202_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22590::$$$message_0202_0019_0001$$$::Which is exactly why I already knew her answer.[lr]::
22591::$$$message_0202_0019_0002$$$::The only thing left for me to do is nod in agreement, and then walk her home.[lr]::
22592::$$$message_0202_0019_0003$$$::At the least, things can still go back to normal if I leave it at that.::
22593::$$$message_0202_0020_0000$$$::"I see."[lr]::
22594::$$$message_0202_0020_0001$$$::I look at Saber and nod.[lr]::
22595::$$$message_0202_0020_0002$$$::"Then let's come again. We'll have other chances to do something like this."[lr]::
22596::$$$message_0202_0020_0003$$$::It's maybe a dangerous thing to say.::
22597::$$$message_0202_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22598::$$$message_0202_0021_0001$$$::Saber's expression hardens.[lr]::
22599::$$$message_0202_0021_0002$$$::I think she realizes what I'm trying to say.[lr]::
22600::$$$message_0202_0021_0003$$$::She looks directly at me and silently shakes her head.[lr]::
22601::$$$message_0202_0021_0004$$$::There will not be a second time.[lr]::
22602::$$$message_0202_0021_0005$$$::This happened today, and that's where it will stay.::
22603::$$$message_0202_0022_0000$$$::"Why not?"[lr]::
22604::$$$message_0202_0022_0001$$$::I know exactly what Saber's going to say.[lr]::
22605::$$$message_0202_0022_0002$$$::I know I won't be satisfied with her answer, but I ask anyway.::
22606::$$$message_0202_0023_0000$$$::"I need not explain. Servants exist only to fight. What we did today is only me denying what I am.[lr]::
22607::$$$message_0202_0023_0001$$$::I obeyed only because you determined we need rest, but from here on, there is no need for me to rest.[lr]::
22608::$$$message_0202_0023_0002$$$::There are only a few enemies left. Should you order me, I can leave and search for Lancer right now."::
22609::$$$message_0202_0024_0000$$$::She focuses on me, eyes blazing with her fighting spirit.[lr]::
22610::$$$message_0202_0024_0001$$$::Saber is saying that she can head into battle any time if she is ordered to.[lr]::
22611::$$$message_0202_0024_0002$$$::And that...[lr]::
22612::$$$message_0202_0024_0003$$$::...really sets off my anger.::
22613::$$$message_0202_0025_0000$$$::"What the hell? Are you really that eager for a fight?"[lr]::
22614::$$$message_0202_0025_0001$$$::"Of course. The more I fight, the closer I get to the Holy Grail.[lr]::
22615::$$$message_0202_0025_0002$$$::Battle is our priority. I thought you understood that."::
22616::$$$message_0202_0026_0000$$$::"Yeah, I know. And it doesn't make any sense.[lr]::
22617::$$$message_0202_0026_0001$$$::I've been wanting to tell you: you're contradicting yourself.[lr]::
22618::$$$message_0202_0026_0002$$$::You keep saying fighting is important, but you've never once thought you wanted to fight. You've got no other choice, so you're just fighting because you're forced to."::
22619::$$$message_0202_0027_0000$$$::"What!? That is not true. I do not hesitate to fight.[lr]::
22620::$$$message_0202_0027_0001$$$::I have told you that I will do anything to win."[lr]::
22621::$$$message_0202_0027_0002$$$::Yeah, she did say that.[lr]::
22622::$$$message_0202_0027_0003$$$::But that doesn't mean she [font italic=true]likes[font italic=false] fighting.::
22623::$$$message_0202_0028_0000$$$::"As long as you can manage, right? Listen, Saber...[lr]::
22624::$$$message_0202_0028_0001$$$::If all you needed to do was defeat the other Masters to get the Holy Grail, you would've done that already by attacking innocents, like Rider. But you won't do that."::
22625::$$$message_0202_0029_0000$$$::"That is because..."::
22626::$$$message_0202_0030_0000$$$::"It's not that you don't want to involve innocent people. You know very well that people die in battle.[lr]::
22627::$$$message_0202_0030_0001$$$::That's right. That's why you wanted to minimize the fighting. Once you start fighting, people die, which is why you wanted to end it as quickly as possible. In other words, you're just scared of there being casualties in these battles."::
22628::$$$message_0202_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22629::$$$message_0202_0031_0001$$$::Saber's eyes grow wide, like she's seen a ghost, but quickly narrow. She grits her teeth.::
22630::$$$message_0202_0032_0000$$$::"You are wrong. I am not afraid of fighting."[lr]::
22631::$$$message_0202_0032_0001$$$::"Yeah, you're right. You probably haven't been afraid from the start. But that's only because you squashed all your own feelings, like fear, beneath your duty and dignity as king."[lr]::
22632::$$$message_0202_0032_0002$$$::"...Ridiculous."::
22633::$$$message_0202_0033_0000$$$::"And yet you don't want to fight.[lr]::
22634::$$$message_0202_0033_0001$$$::You were just good at it, but it's not a talent you actually wanted.[lr]::
22635::$$$message_0202_0033_0002$$$::Look, I'm going to be blunt: you're not fit to fight. You never wanted to take up the sword in the first place.[lr]::
22636::$$$message_0202_0033_0003$$$::You're just saying it's what you want as a way to talk yourself into actually doing it."::
22637::$$$message_0202_0034_0000$$$::   On top of that...[lr]::
22638::$$$message_0202_0034_0001$$$::Why didn't anyone around her...even herself...figure it out and just say something?::
22639::$$$message_0202_0035_0000$$$::"Shirou, I will brook no further insult, even from you."[lr]::
22640::$$$message_0202_0035_0001$$$::"You can't stand it because it's the truth. If you admitted it, you'd never be able to fight again."::
22641::$$$message_0202_0036_0000$$$::I hear a grinding sound.[lr]::
22642::$$$message_0202_0036_0001$$$::Saber is glaring at me, trying to hold back her anger.[lr]::
22643::$$$message_0202_0036_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22644::$$$message_0202_0036_0003$$$::I can't back down now.[lr]::
22645::$$$message_0202_0036_0004$$$::I know I'm right; I [font italic=true]can't[font italic=false] back down.::
22646::$$$message_0202_0037_0000$$$::"So you should stop. You wanted to stop. You know you're not fit to hold a sword, to fight, so just quit.[lr]::
22647::$$$message_0202_0037_0001$$$::Stop being a Servant, and do something that suits you better."::
22648::$$$message_0202_0038_0000$$$::It's not too late for her to try to find whatever real, human happiness she's always wanted.[lr]::
22649::$$$message_0202_0038_0001$$$::And for that, I would...::
22650::$$$message_0202_0039_0000$$$::"Do not be ridiculous. My only option is to fight. I am here only to obtain the Holy Grail.[lr]::
22651::$$$message_0202_0039_0001$$$::I offered my entire self to protect the vow I made as king. I can do nothing else."::
22652::$$$message_0202_0040_0000$$$::"That's..."[lr]::
22653::$$$message_0202_0040_0001$$$::She's just an object seeking to obtain the Holy Grail.[lr]::
22654::$$$message_0202_0040_0002$$$::That's what ticked me off the most.[lr]::
22655::$$$message_0202_0040_0003$$$::Why does she talk like she's only trying to convince herself?[lr]::
22656::$$$message_0202_0040_0004$$$::Everyone around her took her at her word because she kept insisting on stuff like this!::
22657::$$$message_0202_0041_0000$$$::"You idiot! That's not true! There are plenty of other ways to live your life! You're here in this age now...it's not like back when you were alive.[lr]::
22658::$$$message_0202_0041_0001$$$::You should try to live your life for yourself.[lr]::
22659::$$$message_0202_0041_0002$$$::Don't make the mistake of using the Holy Grail..."::
22660::$$$message_0202_0042_0000$$$::What I say next is what I hope for most.::
22661::$$$message_0202_0043_0000$$$::"Forget about the Holy Grail. Don't use it for anyone else.[lr]::
22662::$$$message_0202_0043_0001$$$::If you're here, you need to live here happily."::
22663::$$$message_0202_0044_0000$$$::My ears pick up the sound of wind.[lr]::
22664::$$$message_0202_0044_0001$$$::Saber doesn't answer.[lr]::
22665::$$$message_0202_0044_0002$$$::She doesn't nod.[lr]::
22666::$$$message_0202_0044_0003$$$::She only looks straight in my eyes.::
22667::$$$message_0202_0045_0000$$$::"I cannot agree.[lr]::
22668::$$$message_0202_0045_0001$$$::I formed a contract to obey you. I did [font italic=true]not[font italic=false] give you my heart, Master."[lr]::
22669::$$$message_0202_0045_0002$$$::Saber speaks slowly and clearly.::
22670::$$$message_0202_0046_0000$$$::"I will not break my vow as a king. I have a responsibility to fulfill my duty.[lr]::
22671::$$$message_0202_0046_0001$$$::King Arthur's goal is to obtain the Holy Grail. Even if that were finished, I will never go back to being Altria.[lr]::
22672::$$$message_0202_0046_0002$$$::My wish remains unchanged. From the moment I drew the sword, my vow could never change."::
22673::$$$message_0202_0047_0000$$$::"What are you talking about? That's not what you really need to do.[lr]::
22674::$$$message_0202_0047_0001$$$::You will never be rewarded for what you did, and that's wrong.[lr]::
22675::$$$message_0202_0047_0002$$$::You don't need the Holy Grail. Besides..."::
22676::$$$message_0202_0048_0000$$$::Besides, Saber's wish won't come true.[lr]::
22677::$$$message_0202_0048_0001$$$::What's already happened can't be changed.::
22678::$$$message_0202_0049_0000$$$::"Saber. You can't redo something that's already happened. Or, at least, you shouldn't. I know you've already figured that out."::
22679::$$$message_0202_0050_0000$$$::"No...that is absolutely..."::
22680::$$$message_0202_0051_0000$$$::"Then I'm going to tell you.[lr]::
22681::$$$message_0202_0051_0001$$$::No matter how bad it ended up, you can't change what's happened. [lr]::
22682::$$$message_0202_0051_0002$$$::Asking for a do-over just because you didn't get the result you wanted is the way a spoiled kid acts!"::
22683::$$$message_0202_0052_0000$$$::We're at an impasse.[lr]::
22684::$$$message_0202_0052_0001$$$::Saber doesn't say anything more, and I don't have any more to say.[lr]::
22685::$$$message_0202_0052_0002$$$::The sound of the wind stops.[lr]::
22686::$$$message_0202_0052_0003$$$::Or rather...[lr]::
22687::$$$message_0202_0052_0004$$$::It pauses for a moment.::
22688::$$$message_0202_0053_0000$$$::An instant later, it picks back up.[lr]::
22689::$$$message_0202_0053_0001$$$::Just as I feel the wind on my cheek...[lr]::
22690::$$$message_0202_0053_0002$$$::"I thought you of all people would understand."[lr]::
22691::$$$message_0202_0053_0003$$$::It becomes a headwind.::
22692::$$$message_0202_0054_0000$$$::"Is that all you have to say after wasting our day?"[lr]::
22693::$$$message_0202_0054_0001$$$::Her voice is cold.[lr]::
22694::$$$message_0202_0054_0002$$$::I hear only rejection in it.::
22695::$$$message_0202_0055_0000$$$::"How...arrogant. What knowledge can you claim to possess that lets you understand me?[lr]::
22696::$$$message_0202_0055_0001$$$::You have no right to involve yourself in my affairs.[lr]::
22697::$$$message_0202_0055_0002$$$::Ordering me not to fight? An untrained Master like you, who is so reliant on my protection, has no right to talk. You should keep such drivel to yourself until you are able to fight [font italic=true]for[font italic=false] yourself.[lr]::
22698::$$$message_0202_0055_0003$$$::...Though I am unsure whether that will ever happen."::
22699::$$$message_0202_0056_0000$$$::"No... This isn't just 'drivel'!"::
22700::$$$message_0202_0057_0000$$$::"It most assuredly is! Think only of myself? I could say the same of you![lr]::
22701::$$$message_0202_0057_0001$$$::You place no value upon your own life.[lr]::
22702::$$$message_0202_0057_0002$$$::You say that I am wrong, while doing the very same thing.[lr]::
22703::$$$message_0202_0057_0003$$$::Only the dead think of prioritizing the lives of others.[lr]::
22704::$$$message_0202_0057_0004$$$::How can a complete fool who does not know the value of their own life spout such nonsense?"::
22705::$$$message_0202_0058_0000$$$::"Saber...why you..."::
22706::$$$message_0202_0059_0000$$$::"Did I strike a nerve? I would be happy to dissolve our contract right now. You have no desire for the Holy Grail in any case.[lr]::
22707::$$$message_0202_0059_0001$$$::I will defeat the remaining Masters and obtain the Holy Grail alone.[lr]::
22708::$$$message_0202_0059_0002$$$::If you do not want to fight, then you need only hide."::
22709::$$$message_0202_0060_0000$$$::"Saber. Are you serious?"[lr]::
22710::$$$message_0202_0060_0001$$$::My voice trembles.[lr]::
22711::$$$message_0202_0060_0002$$$::My teeth are rattling... I'm angrier than I realized.::
22712::$$$message_0202_0061_0000$$$::"Of course. My only goal is attaining the Holy Grail. Nothing else is important to me.[lr]::
22713::$$$message_0202_0061_0001$$$::And you, Shirou, are no exception."::
22714::$$$message_0202_0062_0000$$$::I struggle to breathe.[lr]::
22715::$$$message_0202_0062_0001$$$::I try to fight the blackness encroaching on my vision, try to get my heart beating again.::
22716::$$$message_0202_0063_0000$$$::"You [font italic=true]idiot[font italic=false]! Fine! If you're that eager to fight, go do it yourself! I don't care anymore!"::
22717::$$$message_0202_0064_0000$$$::I can't keep my emotions under control.[lr]::
22718::$$$message_0202_0064_0001$$$::I yell out some sort of lame excuse, then turn and run.[lr]::
22719::$$$message_0202_0064_0002$$$::I run away from her.[lr]::
22720::$$$message_0202_0064_0003$$$::And for an instant...[lr]::
22721::$$$message_0202_0064_0004$$$::I think I see Saber just standing there, dumbfounded.::
22722::$$$message_0202_0065_0000$$$::"Damn...damn...dammit!"[lr]::
22723::$$$message_0202_0065_0001$$$::I just run.[lr]::
22724::$$$message_0202_0065_0002$$$::I don't know why I'm mad, only that I am. So I run in a fit of rage.::
22725::$$$message_0202_0066_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"Nothing else is important to me. And you, Shirou, are no exception."[font italic=false]::
22726::$$$message_0202_0067_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
22727::$$$message_0202_0067_0001$$$::I grit my teeth.[lr]::
22728::$$$message_0202_0067_0002$$$::Honestly, I'm getting dizzy just thinking back on what she said. I'm so unfocused, I might run into a pole or something.::
22729::$$$message_0202_0068_0000$$$::Well, it would be easy if I could do that.[lr]::
22730::$$$message_0202_0068_0001$$$::If I was only angry at Saber, I should've taken it out on her like an idiot and just been done with it.[lr]::
22731::$$$message_0202_0068_0002$$$::But something else caused my fit of rage.[lr]::
22732::$$$message_0202_0068_0003$$$::I'm not mad at Saber.[lr]::
22733::$$$message_0202_0068_0004$$$::I'm so frustrated that I keep running, and I don't allow myself to catch my breath because I know I'm a spineless good-for-nothing.::
22734::$$$message_0202_0069_0000$$$::Saber just stands there, gaping at me.[lr]::
22735::$$$message_0202_0069_0001$$$::I heard her faintly, just as the wind changed directions...::
22736::$$$message_0202_0070_0000$$$::                         [font italic=true]"I thought you of all people would understand."[font italic=false]::
22737::$$$message_0202_0071_0000$$$::"Damn...the hell I would know that... You idiot!"[lr]::
22738::$$$message_0202_0071_0001$$$::I immediately regret my words, and nearly trip.[lr]::
22739::$$$message_0202_0071_0002$$$::What did those words mean?[lr]::
22740::$$$message_0202_0071_0003$$$::They had sounded like parting words, but also...like she'd been about to cry.[lr]::
22741::$$$message_0202_0071_0004$$$::Now that I think back, that was probably the only honest thing she'd said.::
22742::$$$message_0202_0072_0000$$$::She'd hung her head as she muttered that to me.[lr]::
22743::$$$message_0202_0072_0001$$$::Her voice was a mixture of expectation, disappointment, and pleading.[lr]::
22744::$$$message_0202_0072_0002$$$::Then...[lr]::
22745::$$$message_0202_0072_0003$$$::Who was the betrayer, and who was betrayed?::
22746::$$$message_0202_0073_0000$$$::I run into my room and slam the sliding door.[lr]::
22747::$$$message_0202_0073_0001$$$::I flop onto the floor, arms and legs splayed.[lr]::
22748::$$$message_0202_0073_0002$$$::I'm tired of standing.[lr]::
22749::$$$message_0202_0073_0003$$$::I just want to lie down and go right to sleep.::
22750::$$$message_0202_0074_0000$$$::"Ha...haaah...ha...ha..."[lr]::
22751::$$$message_0202_0074_0001$$$::But even when I lie down, my body's on fire.[lr]::
22752::$$$message_0202_0074_0002$$$::My heart feels like it's about to burst, and my lungs are desperate to take in oxygen.[lr]::
22753::$$$message_0202_0074_0003$$$::I ran back here at full speed, not even pausing once, so I can't blame my body for the discomfort.[lr]::
22754::$$$message_0202_0074_0004$$$::I feel like I still haven't run enough, but my body is telling me to slow down.::
22755::$$$message_0202_0075_0000$$$::"Ha...haaah...ha...ha..."[lr]::
22756::$$$message_0202_0075_0001$$$::It takes a bit, but I manage to calm down.[lr]::
22757::$$$message_0202_0075_0002$$$::I take a deep breath, hold it, then release it.::
22758::$$$message_0202_0076_0000$$$::"Ha...haaa...ha...ahhh."[lr]::
22759::$$$message_0202_0076_0001$$$::After my breathing calms down...[lr]::
22760::$$$message_0202_0076_0002$$$::...there's just one thing left swirling in my head, and it's a simple question: What am I really angry about?::
22761::$$$message_0202_0077_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22762::$$$message_0202_0077_0001$$$::It's not really something I need to think about.[lr]::
22763::$$$message_0202_0077_0002$$$::I was running because I know I'm helpless.::
22764::$$$message_0202_0078_0000$$$::I can't help Saber.[lr]::
22765::$$$message_0202_0078_0001$$$::It's so frustrating, I'm angry with myself.[lr]::
22766::$$$message_0202_0078_0002$$$::I can't do anything.[lr]::
22767::$$$message_0202_0078_0003$$$::I said I was going to make her smile.[lr]::
22768::$$$message_0202_0078_0004$$$::I decided to protect Saber, but I couldn't do anything, and that's making me so, so angry.::
22769::$$$message_0202_0079_0000$$$::"But what can I do? If Saber doesn't even [font italic=true]want[font italic=false] happiness, there's no point in someone else trying to get involved."[lr]::
22770::$$$message_0202_0079_0001$$$::That's why I tried to help Saber find happiness on her own.[lr]::
22771::$$$message_0202_0079_0002$$$::But she told me those efforts were futile, even called me an idiot.::
22772::$$$message_0202_0080_0000$$$::"A fool who doesn't even know the value of his own life, huh?"[lr]::
22773::$$$message_0202_0080_0001$$$::But what do I do with all that?[lr]::
22774::$$$message_0202_0080_0002$$$::I value my life, and I don't want to do anything to end it.::
22775::$$$message_0202_0081_0000$$$::And my life has nothing to do with Saber.[lr]::
22776::$$$message_0202_0081_0001$$$::Bringing my circumstances into this wasn't fair.[lr]::
22777::$$$message_0202_0081_0002$$$::No matter how stupid I am, I know for sure that Saber's wrong.[lr]::
22778::$$$message_0202_0081_0003$$$::But when she outright rejects me like that, there's not really anything I can do.::
22779::$$$message_0202_0082_0000$$$::"Damn...argh! She can do whatever the hell she wants!"[lr]::
22780::$$$message_0202_0082_0001$$$::I roll over to lay flat on my face.[lr]::
22781::$$$message_0202_0082_0002$$$::Now all I see is the tatami mat, so I might as well close my eyes and empty my mind.::
22782::$$$message_0202_0083_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
22783::$$$message_0202_0083_0001$$$::I don't care what happens to Saber.[lr]::
22784::$$$message_0202_0083_0002$$$::If the Holy Grail is so important, then she should just marry it![lr]::
22785::$$$message_0202_0083_0003$$$::If she is going to be this stubborn after I've told her this so many times, I should just stay out of it, or I'll end up getting burned.[lr]::
22786::$$$message_0202_0083_0004$$$::Actually, I might not get out of that mess with only a burn... I might actually get really hurt...::
22787::$$$message_0202_0084_0000$$$::"The hell!?"[lr]::
22788::$$$message_0202_0084_0001$$$::I've already gotten hurt.[lr]::
22789::$$$message_0202_0084_0002$$$::This is worse than just getting burned.[lr]::
22790::$$$message_0202_0084_0003$$$::I met her, fought with her multiple times, and to survive, I saw into the depths of her heart in a moment of incredible intimacy.::
22791::$$$message_0202_0085_0000$$$::I remember her heat...the light deep inside her.[lr]::
22792::$$$message_0202_0085_0001$$$::I don't know why I'm remembering this right now.[lr]::
22793::$$$message_0202_0085_0002$$$::There's a faraway grassy field...memories of a girl left behind.[lr]::
22794::$$$message_0202_0085_0003$$$::The moment I think back to that beauty, nothing matters anymore... What Saber says doesn't matter.::
22795::$$$message_0202_0086_0000$$$::"You're just a thing to fight? Then don't expose your own weakness, for crying out loud."[lr]::
22796::$$$message_0202_0086_0001$$$::Saber is just unfair.[lr]::
22797::$$$message_0202_0086_0002$$$::I don't know what, exactly, is unfair about her, but I know [font italic=true]something[font italic=false] is.::
22798::$$$message_0202_0087_0000$$$::Angry as I am, I can't hate her. The more I want to forget her, the harder it gets. It's all tangled up.::
22799::$$$message_0202_0088_0000$$$::"Damn. So the person who falls in love just gets screwed over!?"[lr]::
22800::$$$message_0202_0088_0001$$$::But I can't help it.[lr]::
22801::$$$message_0202_0088_0002$$$::I can't give up no matter how many times she tells me it's useless. I just have to see it through to the end.::
22802::$$$message_0202_0089_0000$$$::                         [font italic=true]"I thought you of all people would understand."[font italic=false]::
22803::$$$message_0202_0090_0000$$$::"Ugh."[lr]::
22804::$$$message_0202_0090_0001$$$::I remember her face there, on the verge of tears.[lr]::
22805::$$$message_0202_0090_0002$$$::Does that mean...[lr]::
22806::$$$message_0202_0090_0003$$$::Will she make that face every time I do something like this?::
22807::$$$message_0202_0091_0000$$$::"But I can't. No matter what happens, I can't agree."[lr]::
22808::$$$message_0202_0091_0001$$$::I'm going to keep doing this, even if I'm wrong.[lr]::
22809::$$$message_0202_0091_0002$$$::If she's really important to me, I'll never apologize to her...::
