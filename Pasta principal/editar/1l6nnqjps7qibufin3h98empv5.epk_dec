24315::$$$message_0213_0000_0000$$$::"It's done.[lr]::
24316::$$$message_0213_0000_0001$$$::I'm having her sleep in the Japanese-style room. She's not waking up anytime soon though, not with the state she's in."::
24317::$$$message_0213_0001_0000$$$::"Thanks for taking a look.[lr]::
24318::$$$message_0213_0001_0001$$$::I wouldn't have been able to treat Saber."::
24319::$$$message_0213_0002_0000$$$::"Well, I just took her armor off to make her more comfortable. There's really nothing to thank me for. Saber's not improving, so I didn't do much."::
24320::$$$message_0213_0003_0000$$$::...But still I'm glad Tohsaka was here.[lr]::
24321::$$$message_0213_0003_0001$$$::The moment I arrived home carrying Saber, Tohsaka understood what was going on.::
24322::$$$message_0213_0004_0000$$$::It's been an hour.[lr]::
24323::$$$message_0213_0004_0001$$$::She tried telling Saber what she was going to do, then took her armor off.::
24324::$$$message_0213_0005_0000$$$::"So what happened?[lr]::
24325::$$$message_0213_0005_0001$$$::You went to go find Shinji, and you came home with a wounded Saber. I know something happened. Care to explain?"::
24326::$$$message_0213_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
24327::$$$message_0213_0006_0001$$$::I don't know how to explain.[lr]::
24328::$$$message_0213_0006_0002$$$::Saber's Noble Phantasm...[lr]::
24329::$$$message_0213_0006_0003$$$::I shouldn't disclose her True Name.[lr]::
24330::$$$message_0213_0006_0004$$$::I can't decide on my own to reveal that.::
24331::$$$message_0213_0007_0000$$$::"Rider's been defeated. Shinji lost his Command Spells and dropped out. But...Saber used her Noble Phantasm, then collapsed right after.::
24332::$$$message_0213_0008_0000$$$::"Hm. Saber's Noble Phantasm..."::
24333::$$$message_0213_0009_0000$$$::"Hmmm. I do want details, but I can let that go for now. Probably the least of your concerns at this point."[lr]::
24334::$$$message_0213_0009_0001$$$::"Why? What do you mean, the least of my concerns?"::
24335::$$$message_0213_0010_0000$$$::"How was that unclear? You've got to have figured it out by now, that Saber's going to disappear."[lr]::
24336::$$$message_0213_0010_0001$$$::"Wha...!"[lr]::
24337::$$$message_0213_0010_0002$$$::She says it so calmly.[lr]::
24338::$$$message_0213_0010_0003$$$::Tohsaka just casually brings up the one thing I've been trying so hard to avoid.::
24339::$$$message_0213_0011_0000$$$::"Disappear? You're saying Saber's going to disappear?"::
24340::$$$message_0213_0012_0000$$$::"Yes. Saber's almost out of magical energy. I don't know what sort of Noble Phantasm she used, but it must have burned through an incredible amount of magical energy.[lr]::
24341::$$$message_0213_0012_0001$$$::Saber's used up most of the magical energy she had.[lr]::
24342::$$$message_0213_0012_0002$$$::She's in so much agony because she's fighting so hard to remain here, even as she's on the brink of disappearing from the lack of magical energy."::
24343::$$$message_0213_0013_0000$$$::"She's going to disappear because she doesn't have magical energy... So you're saying that Saber is going to disappear even though she's not hurt?"::
24344::$$$message_0213_0014_0000$$$::"Yes. Running out of magical energy is a more serious problem than a Servant just getting wounded.[lr]::
24345::$$$message_0213_0014_0001$$$::Magical energy is how Servants are able to give their spirit forms flesh. Without it, they will disappear."::
24346::$$$message_0213_0015_0000$$$::"Typically, Masters provide their Servants with magical energy so that doesn't happen, but you can't do that.[lr]::
24347::$$$message_0213_0015_0001$$$::That means Saber can only fight with her own magical energy. Once she runs out, it's over. You were told that from the start."::
24348::$$$message_0213_0016_0000$$$::    That...[lr]::
24349::$$$message_0213_0016_0001$$$::...is definitely what Saber said.::
24350::$$$message_0213_0017_0000$$$::She was fine before. And Saber said she could recover if she slept[line2]"::
24351::$$$message_0213_0018_0000$$$::"Only because she had an extraordinary amount of magical energy to begin with.[lr]::
24352::$$$message_0213_0018_0001$$$::And yes, there is still some magical energy left in Saber.[lr]::
24353::$$$message_0213_0018_0002$$$::She can probably recover enough magical energy to maintain her body without disappearing."::
24354::$$$message_0213_0019_0000$$$::"But that'll be about it. Saber will need to fight as she is now.[lr]::
24355::$$$message_0213_0019_0001$$$::She absolutely cannot use her Noble Phantasm again. The next time she does, she [font italic=true]will[font italic=false] disappear."::
24356::$$$message_0213_0020_0000$$$::"...She'll disappear if she uses her Noble Phantasm..."[lr]::
24357::$$$message_0213_0020_0001$$$::Well, I wouldn't want Saber fighting like this at all.[lr]::
24358::$$$message_0213_0020_0002$$$::I don't ever want to see Saber on her knees, in that kind of pain again.::
24359::$$$message_0213_0021_0000$$$::"Now do you understand? You only have two ways of getting Saber back to her normal state.[lr]::
24360::$$$message_0213_0021_0001$$$::Either the Master replenishes their magical energy, or they have the Servant collect magical energy themselves."::
24361::$$$message_0213_0022_0000$$$::A Servant collecting it themselves…[lr]::
24362::$$$message_0213_0022_0001$$$::That would mean killing innocent people, like Rider.::
24363::$$$message_0213_0023_0000$$$::"That's impossible. Saber would never do that. She said herself that she'd never do such a thing."::
24364::$$$message_0213_0024_0000$$$::"I figured as much. If she had to involve innocent people, I'm sure Saber would choose to let herself disappear.[lr]::
24365::$$$message_0213_0024_0001$$$::Then there's only one other option. If you don't want Saber to disappear, you'll need to provide her with magical energy."::
24366::$$$message_0213_0025_0000$$$::"If I could...I would've done that a long time ago.[lr]::
24367::$$$message_0213_0025_0001$$$::But I don't know how to give her magical energy. I can't do everything you can."::
24368::$$$message_0213_0026_0000$$$::"Probably not. And it's too late to teach you magecraft to share magical energy. You're really not suited to be a mage, so it would probably take you a year to learn, and even if you learned it, you wouldn't be able to [font italic=true]use[font italic=false] it.[lr]::
24369::$$$message_0213_0026_0001$$$::Well, a path should have been created between you and Saber during her summoning, so there might be a different way, but..."::
24370::$$$message_0213_0028_0000$$$::"Listen. If you want to save Saber, you'll have to make her attack people and then have her eat their souls.[lr]::
24371::$$$message_0213_0028_0001$$$::Which I'm sure you know already."::
24372::$$$message_0213_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
24373::$$$message_0213_0029_0001$$$::That's the most realistic method.[lr]::
24374::$$$message_0213_0029_0002$$$::But it's...::
24375::$$$message_0213_0030_0000$$$::"I'm sure Saber would hate that.[lr]::
24376::$$$message_0213_0030_0001$$$::But if you just do nothing, Saber will disappear, and you'll become a target for other Masters."::
24377::$$$message_0213_0031_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
24378::$$$message_0213_0031_0001$$$::Saber's going to disappear...?[lr]::
24379::$$$message_0213_0031_0002$$$::I can't even consider that.[lr]::
24380::$$$message_0213_0031_0003$$$::I still remember the warmth of her body when I was carrying her.::
24381::$$$message_0213_0032_0000$$$::"Then there's only one answer.[lr]::
24382::$$$message_0213_0032_0001$$$::   Use a Command Spell, Emiya. That should at least let you avoid the worst case here."::
24383::$$$message_0213_0033_0000$$$::What she's trying to say is...[lr]::
24384::$$$message_0213_0033_0001$$$::I need to order Saber to kill innocent people.::
24385::$$$message_0213_0034_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
24386::$$$message_0213_0034_0001$$$::I can't say anything.[lr]::
24387::$$$message_0213_0034_0002$$$::I resent what Tohsaka is saying, but there's a part of me that has to admit it could be one of our options.::
24388::$$$message_0213_0035_0000$$$::"I'll let you decide. Saber's condition might settle down if she sleeps, but she's at her limit."[lr]::
24389::$$$message_0213_0036_0000$$$::Tohsaka leaves the living room.[lr]::
24390::$$$message_0213_0036_0001$$$::I can't even lift my head. All I can do is listen to the sound of her footsteps receding down the hall.::
