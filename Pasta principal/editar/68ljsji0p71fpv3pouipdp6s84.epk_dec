41184::$$$message_0360_0000_0000$$$::We're back at my place.[lr]::
41185::$$$message_0360_0000_0001$$$::I never thought we would make it back alive, so the tension in my shoulders relaxes as soon as I get in the living room.[lr]::
41186::$$$message_0360_0000_0002$$$::"...Whoa."[lr]::
41187::$$$message_0360_0000_0003$$$::I feel a bit dizzy and lean against the wall.::
41188::$$$message_0360_0001_0000$$$::"See. You can't even stay standing, idiot."[lr]::
41189::$$$message_0360_0001_0001$$$::"...Mrgh."::
41190::$$$message_0360_0002_0000$$$::...Tohsaka is right, but I think that last part was unnecessary.[lr]::
41191::$$$message_0360_0002_0001$$$::How many times did she call me an idiot today? I bet she set a new record today.::
41192::$$$message_0360_0003_0000$$$::"Come here. It'll be bad if we don't at least replace those bandages."[lr]::
41193::$$$message_0360_0003_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41194::$$$message_0360_0003_0002$$$::I nod at her stare that won't let me say otherwise and go to Tohsaka.::
41195::$$$message_0360_0004_0000$$$::"I can use this first-aid kit, right? Oh, as expected from a house with a dojo.[lr]::
41196::$$$message_0360_0004_0001$$$::It might be because there's this many scissors in here, but it's rare to see a first-aid kit with needles and threads... Hey, hurry up. Take off your clothes and show me your wound."::
41197::$$$message_0360_0005_0000$$$::"Huh... I have to take my clothes off? Oh, no, I can do it myself. I did it this morning too, so there's no problem."::
41198::$$$message_0360_0006_0000$$$::"...Hey. I don't know why you're being so hesitant, but who do you think treated your wound in the first place?"::
41199::$$$message_0360_0007_0000$$$::"...Oof. But that time, um..."[lr]::
41200::$$$message_0360_0007_0001$$$::I was unconscious, so I was only causing an inconvenience to Tohsaka.::
41201::$$$message_0360_0008_0000$$$::"Stop whining and hurry up. Your wound is special, so we have to treat it or else it won't heal."::
41202::$$$message_0360_0009_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
41203::$$$message_0360_0009_0001$$$::...How unfair.[lr]::
41204::$$$message_0360_0009_0002$$$::I can't complain if she tells me with a face like that.::
41205::$$$message_0360_0010_0000$$$::"...Yeah. Then I'll leave it to you. To be honest, it's been burning."[lr]::
41206::$$$message_0360_0010_0001$$$::I give up and sit down.[lr]::
41207::$$$message_0360_0010_0002$$$::Seeing that my clothes are stained with blood, Tohsaka gives up taking it off and starts cutting it right away. She then quickly but carefully takes off the bandages.::
41208::$$$message_0360_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41209::$$$message_0360_0011_0001$$$::...It must've been bad, as Tohsaka slightly gasps.::
41210::$$$message_0360_0012_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
41211::$$$message_0360_0012_0001$$$::...But, I'm troubled as well.[lr]::
41212::$$$message_0360_0012_0002$$$::It's so embarrassing having her stare at my body so closely.::
41213::$$$message_0360_0013_0000$$$::"You really push yourself. It was healing, but it opened up again.[lr]::
41214::$$$message_0360_0013_0001$$$::...Geez. I can't get mad at you if I see a wound like this."[lr]::
41215::$$$message_0360_0013_0002$$$::She talks abusively, yet gently touches my wound.::
41216::$$$message_0360_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41217::$$$message_0360_0014_0001$$$::...Damn. I'm getting dizzy for a different reason.[lr]::
41218::$$$message_0360_0014_0002$$$::I was calm even when we were that close earlier, but now my heart is unstable and I don't know where to look.::
41219::$$$message_0360_0015_0000$$$::"...Oh, man."[lr]::
41220::$$$message_0360_0015_0001$$$::I mutter inside and hit my boiled head, but it does no good.[lr]::
41221::$$$message_0360_0015_0002$$$::The temperature inside my head will keep on going up if we stay like this.::
41222::$$$message_0360_0016_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka? Um, that's enough, right? You can just use a styptic, antibiotic ointment, and rewrap the bandages."[lr]::
41223::$$$message_0360_0016_0001$$$::"You don't call that treatment... I take it back, I am pissed. You went out with a hack job like this?"::
41224::$$$message_0360_0017_0000$$$::A slapping sound.[lr]::
41225::$$$message_0360_0017_0001$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
41226::$$$message_0360_0017_0002$$$::[font italic=true]W-What was that for...!?[font italic=false][lr]::
41227::$$$message_0360_0017_0003$$$::Tohsaka slapped me on my wound without mercy...!::
41228::$$$message_0360_0018_0000$$$::"Khh, you...! Do you have some grudge against me!?"[lr]::
41229::$$$message_0360_0018_0001$$$::"Humph. You have no idea. You should thank me for going easy on you."[lr]::
41230::$$$message_0360_0018_0002$$$::Saying that, she takes out something that looks like homemade ointment.::
41231::$$$message_0360_0019_0000$$$::"That hurt, right? I healed the dead nerves, so it'll hurt for a while. There's painkiller in this ointment, but it's originally to replace your damaged flesh.[lr]::
41232::$$$message_0360_0019_0001$$$::It'll hurt until it blends in, so don't do anything reckless until the pain goes away."::
41233::$$$message_0360_0020_0000$$$::She applies the jelly-like substance on my wound.[lr]::
41234::$$$message_0360_0020_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41235::$$$message_0360_0020_0002$$$::It looks really suspicious, but Tohsaka is treating me seriously.::
41236::$$$message_0360_0021_0000$$$::"Here, all done. You should feel somewhat better once you wrap bandages around it and get a good night's rest."::
41237::$$$message_0360_0022_0000$$$::She skillfully wraps the bandages around the wound.[lr]::
41238::$$$message_0360_0022_0001$$$::...I'm not praising her, but her wrapping is much better than mine.::
41239::$$$message_0360_0023_0000$$$::"...Yeah. Um, thanks, Tohsaka. I feel better."[lr]::
41240::$$$message_0360_0023_0001$$$::I thank her, trying not to make eye contact.[lr]::
41241::$$$message_0360_0023_0002$$$::"Huh... W-Well, that's good. I'm glad I treated you if you feel better."::
41242::$$$message_0360_0024_0000$$$::"Yeah. It's even more helpful since I didn't think it would heal.[lr]::
41243::$$$message_0360_0024_0001$$$::Anyways, thanks for treating the wound."[lr]::
41244::$$$message_0360_0024_0002$$$::"...H-Heh. Of course. I'm going to heal it as long as I'm treating it."::
41245::$$$message_0360_0025_0000$$$::Finishing the treatment, Tohsaka stands up.[lr]::
41246::$$$message_0360_0025_0001$$$::...Then...[lr]::
41247::$$$message_0360_0025_0002$$$::I don't know why, but she heads straight to the kitchen.::
41248::$$$message_0360_0026_0000$$$::"Tohsaka?"[lr]::
41249::$$$message_0360_0026_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Am I seeing things?[font italic=false][lr]::
41250::$$$message_0360_0026_0002$$$::She's checking inside the refrigerator and the rice cooker.::
41251::$$$message_0360_0027_0000$$$::"Hey, what are you doing?"[lr]::
41252::$$$message_0360_0027_0001$$$::"I'm preparing dinner. You haven't eaten yet right, Shirou? I haven't eaten either. So we're going to have dinner."::
41253::$$$message_0360_0028_0000$$$::"...Yeah, I can tell. But, why are we having dinner in this situation?"[lr]::
41254::$$$message_0360_0028_0001$$$::"It's only natural. People can't come up with decent ideas on an empty stomach, right?"::
41255::$$$message_0360_0029_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
41256::$$$message_0360_0029_0001$$$::Tohsaka declares while glaring at the inside of the refrigerator.::
41257::$$$message_0360_0030_0000$$$::The sounds of clashing tableware echoes.[lr]::
41258::$$$message_0360_0030_0001$$$::It's past 10 PM.[lr]::
41259::$$$message_0360_0030_0002$$$::I don't know how it ended up like this, but I'm eating a late dinner with Tohsaka in the living room.::
41260::$$$message_0360_0031_0000$$$::By the way, the dinner was made by both of us.[lr]::
41261::$$$message_0360_0031_0001$$$::Princess Tohsaka wanted to eat Japanese cuisine, but she didn't even know how to make miso soup.[lr]::
41262::$$$message_0360_0031_0002$$$::It really makes me worried what our school is teaching the girls in cooking class.::
41263::$$$message_0360_0032_0000$$$::Tohsaka focuses on her meal.[lr]::
41264::$$$message_0360_0032_0001$$$::She must be hungry, as her bowl is almost empty.::
41265::$$$message_0360_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41266::$$$message_0360_0033_0001$$$::But, I don't have much of an appetite right now.[lr]::
41267::$$$message_0360_0033_0002$$$::It's partly because this isn't the time to be eating, but more so because I haven't said it yet.::
41268::$$$message_0360_0034_0000$$$::"...Withdraw now."[r][wsay canskip=1]::
41269::$$$message_0360_0034_0001$$$::I haven't expressed my thoughts to Tohsaka who told me that as she left.::
41270::$$$message_0360_0035_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka, I have something I want to talk about."[lr]::
41271::$$$message_0360_0035_0001$$$::I put my chopsticks down and look at Tohsaka.::
41272::$$$message_0360_0036_0000$$$::"What?"[lr]::
41273::$$$message_0360_0036_0001$$$::"I've been thinking since then. About why I joined this battle.[lr]::
41274::$$$message_0360_0036_0002$$$::And what I wanted to do."::
41275::$$$message_0360_0037_0000$$$::"Yeah, and?"[lr]::
41276::$$$message_0360_0037_0001$$$::She urges me as she sips on her miso soup.[lr]::
41277::$$$message_0360_0037_0002$$$::...It puts my spirit down, but I put strength in my abdomen, refusing to lose.::
41278::$$$message_0360_0038_0000$$$::"At first, it was because I was dragged into it. And as long as I became a Master, I wanted to do something about this war.[lr]::
41279::$$$message_0360_0038_0001$$$::...But, it has nothing to do with becoming a Master or being dragged into it."::
41280::$$$message_0360_0039_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
41281::$$$message_0360_0039_0001$$$::"I like being a hero of justice. That's why I need to protect everyone. I don't care about this Master thing. It makes no difference in the fact that I'm going to fight even if I'm not a Master anymore or lost Saber."::
41282::$$$message_0360_0040_0000$$$::I said, ready for Tohsaka's rebuttal.[lr]::
41283::$$$message_0360_0040_0001$$$::...But Tohsaka...[lr]::
41284::$$$message_0360_0040_0002$$$::"Oh, I see."[lr]::
41285::$$$message_0360_0040_0003$$$::...gives an absentminded answer and finishes the food in her bowl. ::
41286::$$$message_0360_0041_0000$$$::"Hey, Tohsaka. I'm talking about serious stuff, so[line2]"::
41287::$$$message_0360_0042_0000$$$::"I'm listening. You're going to fight by yourself, right? You can't stand the fact that people are dying rather than the fact that you might die.[lr]::
41288::$$$message_0360_0042_0001$$$::That's why you decided to fight no matter how weak you are."::
41289::$$$message_0360_0043_0000$$$::She looks straight at me.[lr]::
41290::$$$message_0360_0043_0001$$$::It's as if she sees through a part of me that even I don't know about with integrity... And approves of me fighting.::
41291::$$$message_0360_0044_0000$$$::"Huh... Oh, yeah. That's true."[lr]::
41292::$$$message_0360_0044_0001$$$::"What's with that face? You look like a squirrel that has licked sugar."[lr]::
41293::$$$message_0360_0044_0002$$$::"Well, I thought you were going to object."::
41294::$$$message_0360_0045_0000$$$::"Of course I do. But I can't complain to you when you saved me like that.[lr]::
41295::$$$message_0360_0045_0001$$$::...Besides, I know that you're like that no matter how much I try to stop you."::
41296::$$$message_0360_0046_0000$$$::Tohsaka averts her gaze a bit.[lr]::
41297::$$$message_0360_0046_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
41298::$$$message_0360_0046_0002$$$::I don't know why, but anyway...::
41299::$$$message_0360_0047_0000$$$::"So Tohsaka, we're still cooperating right...!?"[lr]::
41300::$$$message_0360_0047_0001$$$::"...Yeah. It can't be helped, so I'll go along with it. First of all, I'll be so worried that I won't be able to sleep soundly if I let you be on your own. And..."[lr]::
41301::$$$message_0360_0047_0002$$$::She takes a deep breath.[lr]::
41302::$$$message_0360_0047_0003$$$::After getting ready for some reason...::
41303::$$$message_0360_0048_0000$$$::"To say it like you would, I don't hate you.[lr]::
41304::$$$message_0360_0048_0001$$$::...That's how it is for me, so you also don't have a problem being together, right?"::
41305::$$$message_0360_0049_0000$$$::Tohsaka hands me her bowl.[lr]::
41306::$$$message_0360_0049_0001$$$::How long did it take for me to realize that she's asking for seconds?::
41307::$$$message_0360_0050_0000$$$::"Oh... Yeah, of course...! I don't care how much of a tyrant you are; it's what I want!"[lr]::
41308::$$$message_0360_0050_0001$$$::I take the bowl, open the rice cooker, swing the rice paddle, and hand it back to her with an extra portion.[lr]::
41309::$$$message_0360_0050_0002$$$::"...Fine. I'm hungry and the food's good."[lr]::
41310::$$$message_0360_0050_0003$$$::Tohsaka starts eating the mountain of rice.::
41311::$$$message_0360_0051_0000$$$::"...Heh."[lr]::
41312::$$$message_0360_0051_0001$$$::I let out a smile.[lr]::
41313::$$$message_0360_0051_0002$$$::I bet I'm eating with a really happy expression.[lr]::
41314::$$$message_0360_0051_0003$$$::But, I can't put my smile away even if I'm aware.[lr]::
41315::$$$message_0360_0051_0004$$$::I'm so happy right now, so let me smile like a fool for a while...:æþÒ
