56020::$$$message_0496_0000_0000$$$::By the time we're home, the rain has completely stopped.[lr]::
56021::$$$message_0496_0000_0001$$$::...I've been holding hands with Sakura since we left the park.[lr]::
56022::$$$message_0496_0000_0002$$$::She calmed down while we were walking, and we began to get embarrassed as we went up the hill path, but we didn't stop holding hands until we got home.::
56023::$$$message_0496_0001_0000$$$::"Huh...? The lights are on. Sakura, did you come back here earlier?"[lr]::
56024::$$$message_0496_0001_0001$$$::"...Um, I don't think that was me. Maybe it's Ms. Fujimura...?"::
56025::$$$message_0496_0002_0000$$$::"Yeah."[lr]::
56026::$$$message_0496_0002_0001$$$::That could be it. I head for the door, taking Sakura with me.[lr]::
56027::$$$message_0496_0002_0002$$$::Her hand was freezing cold, but now it's incredibly warm.[lr]::
56028::$$$message_0496_0002_0003$$$::I feel reassured by the life I feel flowing through her veins, and go inside like I would if I just got home from school.::
56029::$$$message_0496_0003_0000$$$::"Welcome back. Sorry to intrude, but I made myself at home."::
56030::$$$message_0496_0004_0000$$$::"T-Tohsaka."[lr]::
56031::$$$message_0496_0004_0001$$$::"Ne[line2]Tohsaka...senpai."::
56032::$$$message_0496_0005_0000$$$::"Yeah. I decided to check here as a last resort, but I didn't think you'd come back together... Though there was always a chance, knowing you, Emiya."::
56033::$$$message_0496_0006_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
56034::$$$message_0496_0006_0001$$$::I gasp and push Sakura behind me, facing Tohsaka squarely.::
56035::$$$message_0496_0007_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, you still...!"[lr]::
56036::$$$message_0496_0007_0001$$$::"Of course. As a Tohsaka mage, I can't let Sakura Matou go. If I don't execute her as the administrator of Fuyuki, I'll draw the ire of the Association. It'll be too late once that happens."::
56037::$$$message_0496_0008_0000$$$::"That's your problem. Sakura still hasn't done anything wrong. If you're going to hurt her, then you'll have to go through me."[lr]::
56038::$$$message_0496_0008_0001$$$::"I bet. You're a free mage who isn't affiliated with the Association, so it would be better if I tied up that loose end, too.[lr]::
56039::$$$message_0496_0008_0002$$$::I'm going to kill Sakura. If you get in my way, I'll kill you, too."::
56040::$$$message_0496_0009_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
56041::$$$message_0496_0009_0001$$$::My nerves stand on edge.[lr]::
56042::$$$message_0496_0009_0002$$$::Tohsaka's fingertips.[lr]::
56043::$$$message_0496_0009_0003$$$::If they so much as twitch, that will be the opening shot.::
56044::$$$message_0496_0010_0000$$$::I have to get Sakura outside before Tohsaka finishes an incantation.[lr]::
56045::$$$message_0496_0010_0001$$$::After that...I'll just have to figure it out as we go.[lr]::
56046::$$$message_0496_0010_0002$$$::Right now, I concentrate on how we're going to get out of here.[lr]::
56047::$$$message_0496_0010_0003$$$::There's a huge disparity in our magical skills.[lr]::
56048::$$$message_0496_0010_0004$$$::Archer's probably around, too, and I have no idea how to deal with him.::
56049::$$$message_0496_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56050::$$$message_0496_0011_0001$$$::Tohsaka's lips move slightly.[lr]::
56051::$$$message_0496_0011_0002$$$::Just as I realize that she's about to talk instead of cast a spell...[lr]::
56052::$$$message_0496_0011_0003$$$::"Stop! Please stop, Nee-san!"[lr]::
56053::$$$message_0496_0011_0004$$$::Sakura puts herself between us.::
56054::$$$message_0496_0012_0000$$$::"...Sakura."[lr]::
56055::$$$message_0496_0012_0001$$$::"S-Senpai is right. He's the only person I've hurt so far. If he's willing to forgive me, then I shouldn't be punished."::
56056::$$$message_0496_0013_0000$$$::"...Do you really understand what's happening to your body right now?[lr]::
56057::$$$message_0496_0013_0001$$$::You've got some nerve to say that."[lr]::
56058::$$$message_0496_0013_0002$$$::"...I mean it. I'm still all right.[lr]::
56059::$$$message_0496_0013_0003$$$::What about you, Tohsaka-senpai? Senpai isn't a Master anymore, but you still are. He's back to how he was now that Saber is gone, and you're still going to attack him?"::
56060::$$$message_0496_0014_0000$$$::"Yeah. It doesn't even matter if he's unarmed. If he gets in my way, then I can't show him any mercy."::
56061::$$$message_0496_0015_0000$$$::"Then...if you're going to fight him, then I'll fight you too. I won't lose to you, as Rider's Master."[lr]::
56062::$$$message_0496_0015_0001$$$::Sakura's scared, but she faces Tohsaka with all her courage.::
56063::$$$message_0496_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56064::$$$message_0496_0016_0001$$$::...Is Tohsaka surprised by Sakura's grit, or does she think she's at a disadvantage?[lr]::
56065::$$$message_0496_0016_0002$$$::"Fine. If you really mean that, then win this war. That's the only way to save you.[lr]::
56066::$$$message_0496_0016_0003$$$::If you have the Holy Grail, then you can easily free yourself from Zouken's shackles."::
56067::$$$message_0496_0017_0000$$$::"Uh...Tohsaka-senpai?"[lr]::
56068::$$$message_0496_0017_0001$$$::"I'm not just going to let you go.[lr]::
56069::$$$message_0496_0017_0002$$$::If we're both competing for the Holy Grail, then we're bound to end up fighting. This just isn't the right place for it."::
56070::$$$message_0496_0018_0000$$$::She walks by us.[lr]::
56071::$$$message_0496_0018_0001$$$::Without any hostility or bloodlust, Tohsaka pushes past us with surprising grace.::
56072::$$$message_0496_0019_0000$$$::"Tohsaka."[lr]::
56073::$$$message_0496_0019_0001$$$::"Hmph. Our united front lasted all of one day. Can't really call this an alliance anymore, if you're going to protect Sakura."[lr]::
56074::$$$message_0496_0019_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
56075::$$$message_0496_0020_0000$$$::"But don't forget. We don't know when she'll lose control again.[lr]::
56076::$$$message_0496_0020_0001$$$::You can get yourself killed if you want...but she's your responsibility now, so make sure you're the only victim."[lr]::
56077::$$$message_0496_0020_0002$$$::She leaves without looking back.::
56078::$$$message_0496_0021_0000$$$::"...Senpai, um. I..."[lr]::
56079::$$$message_0496_0021_0001$$$::"Don't look so worried, stupid. That's just Tohsaka's way of being sarcastic. She teases people for fun."[lr]::
56080::$$$message_0496_0021_0002$$$::"..."::
56081::$$$message_0496_0022_0000$$$::I give the sad girl a little push and go into the hallway.[lr]::
56082::$$$message_0496_0022_0001$$$::We're both freezing, so we need to change and get warm.::
56083::$$$message_0496_0023_0000$$$::"She's your responsibility now, so make sure you're the only victim."::
56084::$$$message_0496_0024_0000$$$::She means that I need to take Sakura down with me, if she kills me.[lr]::
56085::$$$message_0496_0024_0001$$$::That was the minimum condition Tohsaka laid down when she left.[lr]::
56086::$$$message_0496_0024_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
56087::$$$message_0496_0024_0003$$$::...It won't happen.[lr]::
56088::$$$message_0496_0024_0004$$$::I tell myself that while I take Sakura to the living room.::
56089::$$$message_0496_0025_0000$$$::...Her hand feels so warm.[lr]::
56090::$$$message_0496_0025_0001$$$::Sakura's alive, and she's here.[lr]::
56091::$$$message_0496_0025_0002$$$::That's all I care about now.[lr]::
56092::$$$message_0496_0025_0003$$$::I can't let other doubts plague me and make Sakura more worried, but...::
56093::$$$message_0496_0026_0000$$$::"...Mm?"[lr]::
56094::$$$message_0496_0026_0001$$$::Hold on.[lr]::
56095::$$$message_0496_0026_0002$$$::Her hand is too warm.::
56096::$$$message_0496_0027_0000$$$::"Sakura. Is your fever back?"[lr]::
56097::$$$message_0496_0027_0001$$$::"Huh...? U-um, I'm not sure. Do I feel hot?"[lr]::
56098::$$$message_0496_0027_0002$$$::Sakura says something strange, like she hasn't even noticed.::
56099::$$$message_0496_0028_0000$$$::"Not really, but you're still warmer than I am. It's like I feel all warm and fuzzy just by touching you."[lr]::
56100::$$$message_0496_0028_0001$$$::"Ah...i-it must be a cold! I think I caught a cold because I was out in the rain for such a long time!"[lr]::
56101::$$$message_0496_0028_0002$$$::?[lr]::
56102::$$$message_0496_0028_0003$$$::Sakura suddenly looks away bashfully, for some reason.::
56103::$$$message_0496_0029_0000$$$::"Oh. Yeah, you were. You'd better get changed and warm up. I'll make dinner, so go take your temperature, and if you have a cold, wear something warm in the living room. I'll make something easy to eat."::
56104::$$$message_0496_0030_0000$$$::"Ah... N-no, I don't need dinner. Um, I'm going to sleep now, so you should rest too!"[lr]::
56105::$$$message_0496_0030_0001$$$::She half runs away.::
56106::$$$message_0496_0031_0000$$$::"???"[lr]::
56107::$$$message_0496_0031_0001$$$::...Well, okay.[lr]::
56108::$$$message_0496_0031_0002$$$::I'll catch a cold if I stay like this too, so I'd better warm up in the bath.::
