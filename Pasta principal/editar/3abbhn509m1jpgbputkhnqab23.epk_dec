45897::$$$message_0408_0000_0000$$$::    The lethal weapons cross.[lr]::
45898::$$$message_0408_0000_0001$$$::The twin swords and the spear repeatedly attack, trying to take each other's necks.[lr]::
45899::$$$message_0408_0000_0002$$$::Those attacks are continuous, without hesitation.[lr]::
45900::$$$message_0408_0000_0003$$$::Every blow that is released is meant to kill.::
45901::$$$message_0408_0001_0000$$$::Lancer is not an exception.[lr]::
45902::$$$message_0408_0001_0001$$$::Even though he told Rin Tohsaka, his ally, that he would take it easy, that becomes secondary once the battle starts.[lr]::
45903::$$$message_0408_0001_0002$$$::It merely means that if his spear happens to miss Archer's heart and it does not kill him instantly, then he won't finish him off.[lr]::
45904::$$$message_0408_0001_0003$$$::Even in that case, his enemy will die, but Lancer would just need to drag Archer to Rin Tohsaka before he does.[lr]::
45905::$$$message_0408_0001_0004$$$::Lancer does not care what happens after that.::
45906::$$$message_0408_0002_0000$$$::"Ungh!"[lr]::
45907::$$$message_0408_0002_0001$$$::The crimson demonic spear invades the enemy's territory.[lr]::
45908::$$$message_0408_0002_0002$$$::The spear breaks through Archer's defense each time it is thrust.[lr]::
45909::$$$message_0408_0002_0003$$$::It is different from the battle from before.[lr]::
45910::$$$message_0408_0002_0004$$$::Archer cannot handle Lancer's attacks that he was able to dodge that night.::
45911::$$$message_0408_0003_0000$$$::It is only natural.[lr]::
45912::$$$message_0408_0003_0001$$$::This is the second battle.[lr]::
45913::$$$message_0408_0003_0002$$$::Lancer was bound by a certain Command Spell.[lr]::
45914::$$$message_0408_0003_0003$$$::To learn his enemy Master's strengths, his Master told Lancer,[lr]::
45915::$$$message_0408_0003_0004$$$::"Fight with everyone. But do not defeat them. Survive the battle against someone you are fighting against for the first time no matter what." [lr]::
45916::$$$message_0408_0003_0005$$$::That is the only command he was given.[lr]::
45917::$$$message_0408_0003_0006$$$::He obeyed such a ridiculous command, and his "no-holds-barred battle" had finally come.::
45918::$$$message_0408_0004_0000$$$::Therefore, there is no way that it is the same as the last battle.[lr]::
45919::$$$message_0408_0004_0001$$$::There is nothing binding Lancer, and Archer is now fighting the fastest Heroic Spirit out of all the Servants.::
45920::$$$message_0408_0005_0000$$$::"Hnng...!"[lr]::
45921::$$$message_0408_0005_0001$$$::Anguish escapes from Archer for a second time.[lr]::
45922::$$$message_0408_0005_0002$$$::Even his hawk-like eyes cannot follow Lancer's spear.[lr]::
45923::$$$message_0408_0005_0003$$$::The spear's trajectory is no more than a point to start with.[lr]::
45924::$$$message_0408_0005_0004$$$::That was changing into a flash of light now.[lr]::
45925::$$$message_0408_0005_0005$$$::He cannot see the tip of the spear closing in on him.[lr]::
45926::$$$message_0408_0005_0006$$$::Even the movements of Lancer's arms and legs are speeding up to reach the realm that is no longer visible.::
45927::$$$message_0408_0006_0000$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
45928::$$$message_0408_0006_0001$$$::He was able to dodge this much because he knew Lancer's spear from the last battle.[lr]::
45929::$$$message_0408_0006_0002$$$::He is doing what he can now... Using the fact that he is inferior to Lancer when it comes to hand-to-hand combat as a weapon to handle his fierce attacks.[lr]::
45930::$$$message_0408_0006_0003$$$::He is adjusting where he gets attacked.[lr]::
45931::$$$message_0408_0006_0004$$$::The knight in a red cloak limits the attacks by creating fatal openings himself.::
45932::$$$message_0408_0007_0000$$$::Of course, he will die if he does not dodge these attacks.[lr]::
45933::$$$message_0408_0007_0001$$$::But, if he is going to die getting wounds all over his body from trying to avoid an instant death, he'd rather die an instant death with all limbs intact.[lr]::
45934::$$$message_0408_0007_0002$$$::Otherwise, it will all have been for nothing.[lr]::
45935::$$$message_0408_0007_0003$$$::Fortunately, Lancer is still underestimating Archer.[lr]::
45936::$$$message_0408_0007_0004$$$::No, he is simply immersed in the battle itself.[lr]::
45937::$$$message_0408_0007_0005$$$::If they are going to keep on killing each other with just a difference in ability, then he can think of another thirty ways of showing openings.::
45938::$$$message_0408_0008_0000$$$::Predicting the enemy's movements using information gained previously, and breaking the status quo from cultivated battle experience.[lr]::
45939::$$$message_0408_0008_0001$$$::That is the mind of steel called the "mind's eye" that is gained from training.[lr]::
45940::$$$message_0408_0008_0002$$$::This is nothing deemed as extraordinary.[lr]::
45941::$$$message_0408_0008_0003$$$::This is the only skill that he possesses.[lr]::
45942::$$$message_0408_0008_0004$$$::It is not innate like Saber's instinct, but it is a simple weapon that anyone can gain from training in a frank manner.::
45943::$$$message_0408_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45944::$$$message_0408_0009_0001$$$::Lancer withdraws his spear and stops for a bit.[lr]::
45945::$$$message_0408_0009_0002$$$::He observes the disgruntled bowman in red. ::
45946::$$$message_0408_0010_0000$$$::It is obvious who is going to win.[lr]::
45947::$$$message_0408_0010_0001$$$::Archer has no chance of victory at hand-to-hand combat.[lr]::
45948::$$$message_0408_0010_0002$$$::That is something he knew.[lr]::
45949::$$$message_0408_0010_0003$$$::If Archer is a bowman like his name states, this cannot be a fair fight unless he is shooting from a distance.[lr]::
45950::$$$message_0408_0010_0004$$$::But, he blocked the attacks.[lr]::
45951::$$$message_0408_0010_0005$$$::He has been at an advantage and should not last a few more blows, but he blocked my full-force attacks.::
45952::$$$message_0408_0011_0000$$$::   Is he strong, or am I going easy on him?[lr]::
45953::$$$message_0408_0011_0001$$$::I sneer.[lr]::
45954::$$$message_0408_0011_0002$$$::Archer is a mysterious Servant.[lr]::
45955::$$$message_0408_0011_0003$$$::I should admit that he's strong in that regard.::
45956::$$$message_0408_0012_0000$$$::But... It is unthinkable that I'm going easy.[lr]::
45957::$$$message_0408_0012_0001$$$::The first attack was aimed at the neck to blow his face off.[lr]::
45958::$$$message_0408_0012_0002$$$::The second attack was aimed at the heart to smash his rib cage.[lr]::
45959::$$$message_0408_0012_0003$$$::There's no way I'm going easy.[lr]::
45960::$$$message_0408_0012_0004$$$::There's no way, but...[lr]::
45961::$$$message_0408_0012_0005$$$::    It is certainly true that I wasn't trying to kill him.::
45962::$$$message_0408_0013_0000$$$::What is there in a serious battle?[lr]::
45963::$$$message_0408_0013_0001$$$::A battle between Servants comes down to a battle of Noble Phantasms.[lr]::
45964::$$$message_0408_0013_0002$$$::The fact that I'm cornering him without using that fatal attack is proof that I'm going easy.[lr]::
45965::$$$message_0408_0013_0003$$$::That reason...[lr]::
45966::$$$message_0408_0013_0004$$$::The cause seems to be the expression of gratitude that he had never heard before.[lr]::
45967::$$$message_0408_0013_0005$$$::"...Damn. Geez, am I being serious...!?"::
45968::$$$message_0408_0014_0000$$$::"Khh...!"[lr]::
45969::$$$message_0408_0014_0001$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
45970::$$$message_0408_0014_0002$$$::The swords clash harder than before.[lr]::
45971::$$$message_0408_0014_0003$$$::Both parties spring apart with sparks that fly.[lr]::
45972::$$$message_0408_0014_0004$$$::Lancer's full-force blow, as if he is about to hit himself, is offset by Archer's full-force attack.::
45973::$$$message_0408_0015_0000$$$::The distance between them is about five meters.[lr]::
45974::$$$message_0408_0015_0001$$$::With that distance, Lancer would be able to close in at an instantâ€¦[lr]::
45975::$$$message_0408_0015_0002$$$::"...I don't get it."[lr]::
45976::$$$message_0408_0015_0003$$$::The spearman in blue murmurs.::
45977::$$$message_0408_0016_0000$$$::"You went under Caster even though you are this strong? You and Rin would be able to defeat Caster."[lr]::
45978::$$$message_0408_0016_0001$$$::Lancer stops emitting murderous intent, but there is no opening in his stance.[lr]::
45979::$$$message_0408_0016_0002$$$::At that, Archer slightly smiles.::
45980::$$$message_0408_0017_0000$$$::"...I'm surprised. I was wondering what you were going to say, but you are still saying such things?[lr]::
45981::$$$message_0408_0017_0001$$$::Lancer, I chose the option that has the highest possible chance of victory. No matter what Rin thinks, I decided that there is no other option than this."[lr]::
45982::$$$message_0408_0017_0002$$$::His voice, full of confidence, has no sense of guilt.[lr]::
45983::$$$message_0408_0017_0003$$$::The knight in red actually did not regret betraying his Master.::
45984::$$$message_0408_0018_0000$$$::"Is that so? It was stupid of me to even ask."[lr]::
45985::$$$message_0408_0018_0001$$$::Archer agrees.[lr]::
45986::$$$message_0408_0018_0002$$$::Lancer snorts and quietly raises the tip of his spear.::
45987::$$$message_0408_0019_0000$$$::"You are certainly good at fighting. You should be able to manage well with the path you chose.[lr]::
45988::$$$message_0408_0019_0001$$$::   But, that is not the right way. Your sword definitively lacks pride."[lr]::
45989::$$$message_0408_0019_0002$$$::His fighting spirit rises.[lr]::
45990::$$$message_0408_0019_0003$$$::Seeing that, the bowman in red smiles in delight.::
45991::$$$message_0408_0020_0000$$$::"Yeah, unfortunately, I don't have any pride.[lr]::
45992::$$$message_0408_0020_0001$$$::But what about it? Will my name as a hero be disgraced? Hah, don't make me laugh, Lancer. I can wash off disgrace with results.[lr]::
45993::$$$message_0408_0020_0002$$$::You can feed your meaningless pride to the dogs."[lr]::
45994::$$$message_0408_0020_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
45995::$$$message_0408_0020_0004$$$::In an instant.[lr]::
45996::$$$message_0408_0020_0005$$$::The slightly relaxed atmosphere completely changes.::
45997::$$$message_0408_0021_0000$$$::    The air freezes.[lr]::
45998::$$$message_0408_0021_0001$$$::The demonic spear, with the magical energy to disrupt the order of the world and invert cause and effect, is raised.::
45999::$$$message_0408_0022_0000$$$::The murderous intent that is released is nothing like before.[lr]::
46000::$$$message_0408_0022_0001$$$::In the midst of the tension where it is difficult to even breathe...[lr]::
46001::$$$message_0408_0022_0002$$$::"You said 'dogs,' Archer?"[lr]::
46002::$$$message_0408_0022_0003$$$::The spearman in blue bellows in a voice that could drive crows away from the battlefield.::
46003::$$$message_0408_0023_0000$$$::"It's the truth, CÃº Chulainn. If you have pride as a hero, you should get rid of it right now."[lr]::
46004::$$$message_0408_0023_0001$$$::"...Well said. Then, you die first."::
46005::$$$message_0408_0024_0000$$$::Lancer jumps back greatly.[lr]::
46006::$$$message_0408_0024_0001$$$::It is not the matter of distance to thrust his spear.[lr]::
46007::$$$message_0408_0024_0002$$$::The distance that opened between them in an instant is over 100 meters.[lr]::
46008::$$$message_0408_0024_0003$$$::Lancer leaps back to the entrance of this clearing and crouches on all fours like a beast.::
46009::$$$message_0408_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46010::$$$message_0408_0025_0001$$$::Archer's five senses freeze.[lr]::
46011::$$$message_0408_0025_0002$$$::Is it fear or awe?[lr]::
46012::$$$message_0408_0025_0003$$$::Whichever it is, he immediately understood.[lr]::
46013::$$$message_0408_0025_0004$$$::The meaning of Lancer's retreat.[lr]::
46014::$$$message_0408_0025_0005$$$::The fact that his enemy's next attack is literally a fatal attack.::
46015::$$$message_0408_0026_0000$$$::"You know about GÃ¡e Bolg's ability, right, Archer?"[lr]::
46016::$$$message_0408_0026_0001$$$::Lancer, crouching on the ground on all fours, raises his waist.[lr]::
46017::$$$message_0408_0026_0002$$$::His form is like a sprinter waiting for the starting pistol.::
46018::$$$message_0408_0027_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46019::$$$message_0408_0027_0001$$$::Archer does not have the time to answer.[lr]::
46020::$$$message_0408_0027_0002$$$::The knight in red throws away his swords and immerses himself in his own mind as fast as possible.[lr]::
46021::$$$message_0408_0027_0003$$$::But will he make it?[lr]::
46022::$$$message_0408_0027_0004$$$::Lancer's posture...[lr]::
46023::$$$message_0408_0027_0005$$$::If his demonic spear is like the legend, the Noble Phantasm that blocks it cannot be superficial.::
46024::$$$message_0408_0028_0000$$$::"...Here I come. Take this attack as a farewell present...!"[lr]::
46025::$$$message_0408_0028_0001$$$::The blue panther runs.[lr]::
46026::$$$message_0408_0028_0002$$$::Even his afterimage is far away. Lancer sprints towards Archer like the wind.::
46027::$$$message_0408_0029_0000$$$::The distance between both parties is 100 meters.[lr]::
46028::$$$message_0408_0029_0001$$$::Lancer is not going to thrust his spear with that running start.[lr]::
46029::$$$message_0408_0029_0002$$$::The blue figure crouches.[lr]::
46030::$$$message_0408_0029_0003$$$::The spearman that ran through fifty meters in an instant suddenly leaps up from the ground.::
46031::$$$message_0408_0030_0000$$$::His body flies through the air.[lr]::
46032::$$$message_0408_0030_0001$$$::He holds up the magical spear that "always pierces the heart once it is thrust."[lr]::
46033::$$$message_0408_0030_0002$$$::Space distorts.[lr]::
46034::$$$message_0408_0030_0003$$$::   According to the legend...[lr]::
46035::$$$message_0408_0030_0004$$$::That spear scatters numerous arrowheads once it is thrust into the enemy.[lr]::
46036::$$$message_0408_0030_0005$$$::In other words...::
46037::$$$message_0408_0031_0000$$$::"GÃ¡e (Soaring Spear that)..."[lr]::
46038::$$$message_0408_0031_0001$$$::The spear of causality respond to the words.[lr]::
46039::$$$message_0408_0031_0002$$$::The spearman in blue leans back as if drawing a bow,[lr]::
46040::$$$message_0408_0031_0003$$$::"Bolg (Plunges with Death)!!!!!"[lr]::
46041::$$$message_0408_0031_0004$$$::and he slams down that blow with a roar.::
46042::$$$message_0408_0032_0000$$$::It is a Noble Phantasm that was made to be thrown.[lr]::
46043::$$$message_0408_0032_0001$$$::The spear that always pierces the heart once it is aimed.[lr]::
46044::$$$message_0408_0032_0002$$$::The cursed Noble Phantasm that cannot be avoided and will continue attacking the target every time it is avoided.[lr]::
46045::$$$message_0408_0032_0003$$$::That is GÃ¡e Bolg, the spear of destruction possessed by the hero who never lost once in his lifetime.[lr]::
46046::$$$message_0408_0032_0004$$$::There is no way to stop the thing that is shot out with all of Lancer's magical energy. It cannot be avoided nor dodged.::
46047::$$$message_0408_0033_0000$$$::   Therefore, it is fatal.[lr]::
46048::$$$message_0408_0033_0001$$$::There is no way for one to survive once they are targeted by the magical spear...!::
46049::$$$message_0408_0034_0000$$$::The magical bullet approaches.[lr]::
46050::$$$message_0408_0034_0001$$$::In a split second, the knight in red closes his eyes as if accepting his death...::
46051::$$$message_0408_0035_0000$$$::"I am the bone of my sword."::
46052::$$$message_0408_0036_0000$$$::The thorn of light clashes.[lr]::
46053::$$$message_0408_0036_0001$$$::The moment the thorn of destruction comes falling from the sky to directly hit the knight in red...[lr]::
46054::$$$message_0408_0036_0002$$$::"Rho Aias (Seven Rings Cradling the Burning Heavens)!"[lr]::
46055::$$$message_0408_0036_0003$$$::The True Name is spoken, shaking the air.::
46056::$$$message_0408_0037_0000$$$::The spear and shield clash.[lr]::
46057::$$$message_0408_0037_0001$$$::The spear of death which breaks through every protective wall and evasion...[lr]::
46058::$$$message_0408_0037_0002$$$::That spear is stopped.[lr]::
46059::$$$message_0408_0037_0003$$$::The fatal spear is stopped by Archer's Noble Phantasm, swirling up a storm of wind and scattering debris.[lr]::
46060::$$$message_0408_0037_0004$$$::The seven flower petals that appeared from somewhere protect Archer and oppose the magical bullet that tries to shoot him down...!::
46061::$$$message_0408_0037_0005$$$::Who would know?[lr]::
46062::$$$message_0408_0037_0006$$$::This protection itself is Aias. The only thing said to have stopped the javelin of the great hero is the shield of Aias.[lr]::
46063::$$$message_0408_0037_0007$$$::There are seven barriers shaped like flower petals, and each layer is as strong as a castle wall.[lr]::
46064::$$$message_0408_0037_0008$$$::It is a Bounded Field Noble Phantasm that is invincible against any projectile weapon targeted towards the user.::
46065::$$$message_0408_0038_0000$$$::A thrown spear would surely be defeated by the shield without penetrating even one of the petals.[lr]::
46066::$$$message_0408_0038_0001$$$::At the very least, Archer does not know of any spear that can break through this shield.::
46067::$$$message_0408_0039_0000$$$::And yet...[lr]::
46068::$$$message_0408_0039_0001$$$::That fatal spear breaks through it effortlessly.::
46069::$$$message_0408_0040_0000$$$::"...Guh...!!!!!"[lr]::
46070::$$$message_0408_0040_0001$$$::The sixth flower petal is destroyed.[lr]::
46071::$$$message_0408_0040_0002$$$::Only one remains.[lr]::
46072::$$$message_0408_0040_0003$$$::The magical spear reaches the seventh petal that has never been pierced through and doesn't stop its force.::
46073::$$$message_0408_0041_0000$$$::The unstoppable thorn of the magical spear.[lr]::
46074::$$$message_0408_0041_0001$$$::With that right in front of him...[lr]::
46075::$$$message_0408_0041_0002$$$::"NU... NUAAAAAAAAA...!!!!"[lr]::
46076::$$$message_0408_0041_0003$$$::With a roaring spirit, Archer pours all of his magical energy into his own Noble Phantasm...!::
46077::$$$message_0408_0042_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46078::$$$message_0408_0042_0001$$$::Lancer, who has landed on the ground, stares at the Servant in front of him.[lr]::
46079::$$$message_0408_0042_0002$$$::...Archer has wounds all over his body.[lr]::
46080::$$$message_0408_0042_0003$$$::His stretched out arm is like a decayed branch.[lr]::
46081::$$$message_0408_0042_0004$$$::His face is distorted in pain, not only from the wounds on his arm, but from enduring a headache beyond his imagination.::
46082::$$$message_0408_0043_0000$$$::"...I'm surprised. I did not think there was a spear in this world that could penetrate Aias.[lr]::
46083::$$$message_0408_0043_0001$$$::Your spear surpasses the original Gungnir."[lr]::
46084::$$$message_0408_0043_0002$$$::The knight in red compliments the spearman in blue from the bottom of his heart.::
46085::$$$message_0408_0044_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46086::$$$message_0408_0044_0001$$$::There is no way such a thing would get through to Lancer. [lr]::
46087::$$$message_0408_0044_0002$$$::His strongest attack.[lr]::
46088::$$$message_0408_0044_0003$$$::The attack that made him a hero was blocked.[lr]::
46089::$$$message_0408_0044_0004$$$::He is so angry that his glare should be able to kill someone.::
46090::$$$message_0408_0045_0000$$$::But, that anger is almost erased by a strong wonder.[lr]::
46091::$$$message_0408_0045_0001$$$::...It is too strange.[lr]::
46092::$$$message_0408_0045_0002$$$::It is true that Archer is a mysterious Servant.[lr]::
46093::$$$message_0408_0045_0003$$$::His identity is unknown, he carries twin swords while being a bowman, and even showed a shield that could block Lancer's strongest attack.[lr]::
46094::$$$message_0408_0045_0004$$$::That is abnormal.[lr]::
46095::$$$message_0408_0045_0005$$$::Such a hero cannot be found anywhere in this world.::
46096::$$$message_0408_0046_0000$$$::"Who are you...?"[lr]::
46097::$$$message_0408_0046_0001$$$::"I'm just a bowman. Your judgment is not incorrect."[lr]::
46098::$$$message_0408_0046_0002$$$::"Nonsense. A bowman would not have a shield that could block a Noble Phantasm."[lr]::
46099::$$$message_0408_0046_0003$$$::"It depends.[lr]::
46100::$$$message_0408_0046_0004$$$::But, this is the result. I used up most of my magical energy, one of my arms is destroyed, and Aias is completely shattered.[lr]::
46101::$$$message_0408_0046_0005$$$::...Geez, that was my strongest protection."::
46102::$$$message_0408_0047_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46103::$$$message_0408_0047_0001$$$::Lancer keeps glaring at Archer, who is bantering.[lr]::
46104::$$$message_0408_0047_0002$$$::Then...[lr]::
46105::$$$message_0408_0047_0003$$$::"More importantly, have you noticed, Lancer?[lr]::
46106::$$$message_0408_0047_0004$$$::Caster seems to be unexpectedly struggling. She is no longer supervising us."[lr]::
46107::$$$message_0408_0047_0005$$$::Archer adds, raising his arms as if to surrender.::
46108::$$$message_0408_0048_0000$$$:: "...I see. I thought so. So that was your intention from the start."[lr]::
46109::$$$message_0408_0048_0001$$$::"Of course. I told you, right? That I would only choose the option with the highest success rate."[lr]::
46110::$$$message_0408_0048_0002$$$::"...Heh. I really hate you."::
46111::$$$message_0408_0049_0000$$$::Lancer says bitterly and turns his back to Archer.[lr]::
46112::$$$message_0408_0049_0001$$$::...His job is done.[lr]::
46113::$$$message_0408_0049_0002$$$::His role to distract Archer is meaningless now.[lr]::
46114::$$$message_0408_0049_0003$$$::There is no need for him to support Rin Tohsaka any longer.::
46115::$$$message_0408_0050_0000$$$::The spearman in blue turns on one heel to return to his Master, and...[lr]::
46116::$$$message_0408_0050_0001$$$::Lays on the grass to observe some more.:¬¯t
