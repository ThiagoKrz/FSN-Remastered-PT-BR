11718::$$$message_0116_0000_0000$$$::"...Ngh."[lr]::
11719::$$$message_0116_0000_0001$$$::I don't know how serious Illya is.[lr]::
11720::$$$message_0116_0000_0002$$$::I'm sure telling me to be her Servant is some sort of metaphor, and even if she makes me her familiar, nothing's going to change.::
11721::$$$message_0116_0001_0000$$$::I still won't be of any use, and besides, Illya has Berserker.[lr]::
11722::$$$message_0116_0001_0001$$$::Illya doesn't have any kind of use for a half-assed mage like me.::
11723::$$$message_0116_0002_0000$$$::"Answer me.[lr]::
11724::$$$message_0116_0002_0001$$$::Will you be with me?"[lr]::
11725::$$$message_0116_0002_0002$$$::Illya's voice practically brims with expectation.[lr]::
11726::$$$message_0116_0002_0003$$$::And so I...[lr]::
11727::$$$message_0116_0002_0004$$$::"...Fine. I'll be your familiar."[lr]::
11728::$$$message_0116_0002_0005$$$::I lie evasively for the time being.::
11729::$$$message_0116_0003_0000$$$::"Okay! This is exciting! We'll be together forever, brother!"[lr]::
11730::$$$message_0116_0003_0001$$$::"Wha...?"[lr]::
11731::$$$message_0116_0003_0002$$$::Illya starts jumping up and down. She must be really excited.::
11732::$$$message_0116_0004_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
11733::$$$message_0116_0004_0001$$$::...I feel guilty.[lr]::
11734::$$$message_0116_0004_0002$$$::Illya's holding me prisoner, so I had to lie.[lr]::
11735::$$$message_0116_0004_0003$$$::But I feel bad seeing her so happy...so maybe I can indulge Illya a little bit...::
11736::$$$message_0116_0005_0000$$$::"Eh...?"[lr]::
11737::$$$message_0116_0005_0001$$$::A wave of dizziness crashes over me.[lr]::
11738::$$$message_0116_0005_0002$$$::An invisible weight settles across my shoulders.::
11739::$$$message_0116_0006_0000$$$::"Illya."[lr]::
11740::$$$message_0116_0006_0001$$$::Increasingly uneasy, I find myself calling out to her.::
11741::$$$message_0116_0007_0000$$$::"Hm? What is it, Shirou? Oh, I'll undo the restraints on your wrists for you."[lr]::
11742::$$$message_0116_0007_0001$$$::"...Ah. That's not what I... I just feel a little sick."[lr]::
11743::$$$message_0116_0007_0002$$$::Sudden nausea grips me, and I find myself gasping for breath.::
11744::$$$message_0116_0008_0000$$$::"What is it? Do you feel sick? Does your body feel like it's weighing you down? Do you have this indescribable sense of anxiety?"[lr]::
11745::$$$message_0116_0008_0001$$$::   She smiles.[lr]::
11746::$$$message_0116_0008_0002$$$::It's a cruel smile, like she sees right through me.::
11747::$$$message_0116_0009_0000$$$::"Illya..."[lr]::
11748::$$$message_0116_0009_0001$$$::"Yep. I know everything about you, because you formed a contract with me.[lr]::
11749::$$$message_0116_0009_0002$$$::So now you can't hide anything from me."::
11750::$$$message_0116_0010_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
11751::$$$message_0116_0010_0001$$$::Oh, God...[lr]::
11752::$$$message_0116_0010_0002$$$::The strange sense of unease drives me to my feet. It's not at all like the more immediate fear her presence caused in the past.[lr]::
11753::$$$message_0116_0010_0003$$$::But my body refuses to move.[lr]::
11754::$$$message_0116_0010_0004$$$::This isn't Illya's magical energy affecting me.[lr]::
11755::$$$message_0116_0010_0005$$$::My body just...can't move...!?::
11756::$$$message_0116_0011_0000$$$::"Illya...what did you...!?"[lr]::
11757::$$$message_0116_0011_0001$$$::"You did this to yourself. You feel sick because you lied to me. You're a nice person, so you just hurt yourself."::
11758::$$$message_0116_0012_0000$$$::"But...well, you didn't really put your heart into your last response, so I'll ask again."[lr]::
11759::$$$message_0116_0012_0001$$$::"Shirou...you're mine now, right?"::
11760::$$$message_0116_0013_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
11761::$$$message_0116_0013_0001$$$::The weight on my back digs into me, seeming to squirm into my skin.::
11762::$$$message_0116_0014_0000$$$::"Come on, admit it, Shirou. Your soul is already mine."::
11763::$$$message_0116_0015_0000$$$::"Ah...gahhh...!"[lr]::
11764::$$$message_0116_0015_0001$$$::I hear myself wheezing.[lr]::
11765::$$$message_0116_0015_0002$$$::My mouth opens on its own, forming words in quick, shallow breaths.::
11766::$$$message_0116_0016_0000$$$::"All...right... I'll be Illya's fami...liar..."::
11767::$$$message_0116_0017_0000$$$::"Yes. I, Illyasviel, have accepted you, Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
11768::$$$message_0116_0017_0001$$$::Fufufu. Now I have your soul, Shirou."::
11769::$$$message_0116_0018_0000$$$::"...Illya..."[lr]::
11770::$$$message_0116_0018_0001$$$::I need to get up. I need to tear off these ropes. I need to run as far and as fast as I can.[lr]::
11771::$$$message_0116_0018_0002$$$::If she's in the way, I just need to punch her or something to force her aside.[lr]::
11772::$$$message_0116_0018_0003$$$::Otherwise, I don't even want to think about what might happen to me.[lr]::
11773::$$$message_0116_0018_0004$$$::Yeah. I'm in such a dire situation, yet for some reason...::
11774::$$$message_0116_0019_0000$$$::"I can't move..."[lr]::
11775::$$$message_0116_0019_0001$$$::My limbs don't even react, as if to tell me I'm no longer in control of my own body.::
11776::$$$message_0116_0020_0000$$$::"Oh don't worry, Shirou. I've just shut off all the commands going to your body for now.[lr]::
11777::$$$message_0116_0020_0001$$$::For now, your body's just keeping your soul alive. I'll have a new body to serve as a container for it soon.[lr]::
11778::$$$message_0116_0020_0002$$$::Human bodies are so fragile, so I'm going to transfer your consciousness to something else, so it won't matter even if it breaks."::
11779::$$$message_0116_0021_0000$$$::"Oh, but it won't matter if I tell you anyway.[lr]::
11780::$$$message_0116_0021_0001$$$::Hmmm, I doubt you'd understand even if I did explain it to you. Getting used to it yourself will probably be better than being told.[lr]::
11781::$$$message_0116_0021_0002$$$::Sella, Leysritt. I'm going to start the apport now, so bring me some sort of doll for a container."::
11782::$$$message_0116_0022_0000$$$::"...! ...!"[lr]::
11783::$$$message_0116_0022_0001$$$::I can't even talk anymore.[lr]::
11784::$$$message_0116_0022_0002$$$::I'm physically here, but it feels like I'm watching everything that's happening through a screen.::
11785::$$$message_0116_0023_0000$$$::"Here you are, milady. So we are to perform an apport, you say?"[lr]::
11786::$$$message_0116_0023_0001$$$::"Yes. I really don't want to wear it, but I'm going to put on the Dress of Heaven because I don't even want to chance messing up. Liz, can you prepare it?"[lr]::
11787::$$$message_0116_0023_0002$$$::"...It's done. But are you sure, Illya?"::
11788::$$$message_0116_0024_0000$$$::"Wh-what did you just say? Is a defective like you trying to give me her opinion? I-I-I'm not in the wrong here! Sh-Shirou said okay, so I can make him my familiar!"::
11789::$$$message_0116_0025_0000$$$::"No, you are not in the wrong, milady.[lr]::
11790::$$$message_0116_0025_0001$$$::Leysritt, please watch your mouth. We needn't concern ourselves with a mere human like him. If anything, he should be honored, even grateful to be able to experience such a miracle."::
11791::$$$message_0116_0026_0000$$$::"...You indulge Illya too much. Do you realize that might not be such a good thing?"::
11792::$$$message_0116_0027_0000$$$::"Leysritt! Refrain from calling milady by her name! Miss Illyasviel is the successor of the Einzbern's miracle... She is nothing like such failures as us!"::
11793::$$$message_0116_0028_0000$$$::"...Illya, let's begin. Sella's annoying."[lr]::
11794::$$$message_0116_0028_0001$$$::"Leysritt!"::
11795::$$$message_0116_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
11796::$$$message_0116_0029_0001$$$::The calmer of the two women who appear to be maids approaches me.::
11797::$$$message_0116_0030_0000$$$::Liz...or the woman called Leysritt says,[lr]::
11798::$$$message_0116_0030_0001$$$::"I'm sorry. You can't go back to that vessel anymore."[lr]::
11799::$$$message_0116_0030_0002$$$::My vision goes black, like someone's just flipped a switch.::
11800::$$$message_0116_0031_0000$$$::"Oh yes, milady. It seems someone has entered the forest. What would you like to do? Shall we send out Berserker?"::
11801::$$$message_0116_0032_0000$$$::I only hear voices.[lr]::
11802::$$$message_0116_0032_0001$$$::...This is so strange.[lr]::
11803::$$$message_0116_0032_0002$$$::My consciousness is not connected to my limbs, and my senses are...disconnected.[lr]::
11804::$$$message_0116_0032_0003$$$::If my body and senses have no connection, then how the hell am I hearing voices?::
11805::$$$message_0116_0033_0000$$$::"Of course not. They came all the way over here, so it would be rude of us not to show them our hospitality. You two, as well as Berserker, should hide.[lr]::
11806::$$$message_0116_0033_0001$$$::I'm going to show off my Shirou when Rin and Saber arrive. I'll let Berserker do whatever he wants after."::
11807::$$$message_0116_0034_0000$$$::She giggles.[lr]::
11808::$$$message_0116_0034_0001$$$::I feel nothing, and yet...I feel like someone's taking my arm.::
11809::$$$message_0116_0035_0000$$$::   I'm feeling faint.[lr]::
11810::$$$message_0116_0035_0001$$$::I don't know what will happen to me next, but it seems my fight has already ended...::
