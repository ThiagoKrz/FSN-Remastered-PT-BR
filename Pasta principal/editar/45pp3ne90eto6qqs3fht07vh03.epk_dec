34673::$$$message_0280_0000_0000$$$::"...Damn it. Now there's no way Kuzuki will come out from the temple."[lr]::
34674::$$$message_0280_0000_0001$$$::After Caster and Kuzuki disappear...[lr]::
34675::$$$message_0280_0000_0002$$$::Without concern over her wounded chest, Tohsaka grits her teeth in regret.::
34676::$$$message_0280_0001_0000$$$::...I understand how Tohsaka feels.[lr]::
34677::$$$message_0280_0001_0001$$$::At this point, Kuzuki won't come out of the temple.[lr]::
34678::$$$message_0280_0001_0002$$$::If we are to defeat Caster, we're going to have to take the fight to them this time and make an attack on their territory.::
34679::$$$message_0280_0002_0000$$$::But Assassin is the gatekeeper at the temple, and Kuzuki and Caster are not opponents that can be defeated easily. We'll be defeated again if we just attack recklessly.[lr]::
34680::$$$message_0280_0002_0001$$$::Yet we have no other choice but to go to the temple if we want to defeat Caster.::
34681::$$$message_0280_0003_0000$$$::"Rin, I must warn you. That temple is a dangerous place for us Servants.[lr]::
34682::$$$message_0280_0003_0001$$$::The chance at victory is slim even if we have Archer join us and push our way through."[lr]::
34683::$$$message_0280_0003_0002$$$::"...Hmph. I know how strange that mountain is. I won't chase after them no matter how frustrating it is, and I won't involve your Master in attack strategies that are overly aggressive."::
34684::$$$message_0280_0004_0000$$$::"...Then, are you giving up on attacking Caster?"[lr]::
34685::$$$message_0280_0004_0001$$$::"You're kidding. I can't stand being beaten, and most of all, I can't let Caster be. I think your Master has the same opinion, isn't that right?"[lr]::
34686::$$$message_0280_0004_0002$$$::She turns her gaze towards me.::
34687::$$$message_0280_0005_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
34688::$$$message_0280_0005_0001$$$::Saber follows Tohsaka's lead and looks to me as if there's any question.::
34689::$$$message_0280_0006_0000$$$::"Of course. I can't let those two be.[lr]::
34690::$$$message_0280_0006_0001$$$::Caster's not going to stop collecting magical energy, and her Master, Kuzuki, said he won't stop her either. So it's up to us to stop them.[lr]::
34691::$$$message_0280_0006_0002$$$::Assassin is still at the temple, but everything will be settled if we defeat Caster's Master, Kuzuki."::
34692::$$$message_0280_0007_0000$$$::"Yeah. I don't think Mr. Kuzuki will let us take away his Command Spells that easily, but we should be able to manage if we get ahold of him."[lr]::
34693::$$$message_0280_0007_0001$$$::...We'll also have to plan strategies for the time being..."[lr]::
34694::$$$message_0280_0007_0002$$$::   Then...[lr]::
34695::$$$message_0280_0007_0003$$$::I don't know why, but Tohsaka suddenly...::
34696::$$$message_0280_0008_0000$$$::"More than that, what was that earlier, Emiya? Wasn't Strengthening your only magecraft?"[lr]::
34697::$$$message_0280_0008_0001$$$::She asks with a serious expression, as if watching an enemy.::
34698::$$$message_0280_0009_0000$$$::I'm at a loss.[lr]::
34699::$$$message_0280_0009_0001$$$::The magecraft from earlier... Is she asking about reproducing Archer's swords?[lr]::
34700::$$$message_0280_0009_0002$$$::Well, I'm also surprised that I can do that, but it's not something that ought to earn me that look.::
34701::$$$message_0280_0010_0000$$$::"Don't be quiet and answer me. You said before that the only magecraft that you can use is Strengthening, right?"::
34702::$$$message_0280_0011_0000$$$::"Well, yeah. The first magecraft I was able to use was Projection, but I was taught to use Strengthening instead since Projection is inefficient... Wait, did I not tell you about this?"::
34703::$$$message_0280_0012_0000$$$::"...You didn't. It pisses me off that you didn't tell me."[lr]::
34704::$$$message_0280_0012_0001$$$::Her glare intensifies.[lr]::
34705::$$$message_0280_0012_0002$$$::I really don't get why she's so angry with me.::
34706::$$$message_0280_0013_0000$$$::"Then let me ask you. This isn't your first time using Projection magecraft?"::
34707::$$$message_0280_0014_0000$$$::"Oh...well, I guess not. Whenever I fail at Strengthening, I'll often use Projection to clear my head. But it's not like I was able to conjure anything useful like earlier.[lr]::
34708::$$$message_0280_0014_0001$$$::I can get them to look similar on the outside, but everything would be empty on the inside."::
34709::$$$message_0280_0015_0000$$$::"Empty on the inside? What, do you mean you can only reproduce the appearance?"::
34710::$$$message_0280_0016_0000$$$::"No, well, I'd try for the inside too, but it never went well. That's why I'm surprised myself.[lr]::
34711::$$$message_0280_0016_0001$$$::What I imagined isn't close to the real thing, but those swords earlier were pretty close."::
34712::$$$message_0280_0017_0000$$$::"Then does it mean you acquired Projection before Strengthening?"[lr]::
34713::$$$message_0280_0017_0001$$$::"It's more like that was the only thing I could do.[lr]::
34714::$$$message_0280_0017_0002$$$::But my old man said that was useless and I should change my focus to Strengthening."::
34715::$$$message_0280_0018_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I would've had you do the same thing.[lr]::
34716::$$$message_0280_0018_0001$$$::...But that's strange. You reproduced Archer's swords for such a long time, but you can't reproduce normal things.[lr]::
34717::$$$message_0280_0018_0002$$$::...Maybe you have a narrow alignment.[lr]::
34718::$$$message_0280_0018_0003$$$::There are mages who aren't versatile, but are skilled in only one matter..."::
34719::$$$message_0280_0019_0000$$$::She starts thinking out loud.[lr]::
34720::$$$message_0280_0019_0001$$$::Tohsaka doesn't try to look at me.[lr]::
34721::$$$message_0280_0019_0002$$$::"...Let's go home for today.[lr]::
34722::$$$message_0280_0019_0003$$$::Saber seems to have used magical energy to heal herself, so we have to let her rest."[lr]::
34723::$$$message_0280_0019_0004$$$::And she goes home by herself just like that.::
