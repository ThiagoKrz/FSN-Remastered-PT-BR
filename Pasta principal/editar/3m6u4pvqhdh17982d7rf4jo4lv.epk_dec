30848::$$$message_0244_0000_0000$$$::I get to school over an hour late.[lr]::
30849::$$$message_0244_0000_0001$$$::The hallway is crowded with students between classes.[lr]::
30850::$$$message_0244_0000_0002$$$::It seems like 2-C also finished class just now, as many familiar faces file out.::
30851::$$$message_0244_0001_0000$$$::"Yo. I don't know why, but Taiga was pissed. You should brace yourself for fourth period."[lr]::
30852::$$$message_0244_0001_0001$$$::"...Oh yeah. I have English today."::
30853::$$$message_0244_0002_0000$$$::My classmates tell me the very thing I don't want to hear.[lr]::
30854::$$$message_0244_0002_0001$$$::The moment I sluggishly put my hand on the door...[lr]::
30855::$$$message_0244_0002_0002$$$::"Mm?"[lr]::
30856::$$$message_0244_0002_0003$$$::The history teacher comes out.::
30857::$$$message_0244_0003_0000$$$::"Good morning, Mr. Kuzuki."[lr]::
30858::$$$message_0244_0003_0001$$$::"You were late, Emiya? We went over what's going to be covered in the exam. Make sure to get it from a friend later."[lr]::
30859::$$$message_0244_0003_0002$$$::"Y-yes. I'm sorry for being late."::
30860::$$$message_0244_0004_0000$$$::Kuzuki nods and leaves.[lr]::
30861::$$$message_0244_0004_0001$$$::Souichirou Kuzuki is the ironclad teacher that teaches world history and ethics. He's also in charge of the student council.[lr]::
30862::$$$message_0244_0004_0002$$$::Though he's a terse talker like that, he's kind of a rarity in this school where his popularity grows as people come to know him.::
30863::$$$message_0244_0005_0000$$$::"Morning."[lr]::
30864::$$$message_0244_0005_0001$$$::I make my way to my desk and greet people as I go.[lr]::
30865::$$$message_0244_0005_0002$$$::It's a little embarrassing to show up late like this.::
30866::$$$message_0244_0006_0000$$$::"Hey. You're here rather late."[lr]::
30867::$$$message_0244_0006_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
30868::$$$message_0244_0006_0002$$$::Someone greets me, so I turn around.[lr]::
30869::$$$message_0244_0006_0003$$$::   There...[lr]::
30870::$$$message_0244_0006_0004$$$::It's Shinji, strangely all smiles.::
30871::$$$message_0244_0007_0000$$$::"...Shinji? What's wrong? You're acting weird.[lr]::
30872::$$$message_0244_0007_0001$$$::Did you not get enough sleep last night?"[lr]::
30873::$$$message_0244_0007_0002$$$::I tell him my honest opinion.[lr]::
30874::$$$message_0244_0007_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
30875::$$$message_0244_0007_0004$$$::For a moment he scowls, then his smile returns.[lr]::
30876::$$$message_0244_0007_0005$$$::Shinji was strange yesterday, but that doesn't even compare with this morning.::
30877::$$$message_0244_0008_0000$$$::"Shinji? Were you attacked? You idiot, I thought I told you. Stay home if you want to protect yourself."[lr]::
30878::$$$message_0244_0008_0001$$$::"...Shut up. What's with the high and mighty tone?"[lr]::
30879::$$$message_0244_0008_0002$$$::"...Shinji?"::
30880::$$$message_0244_0009_0000$$$::"What, full of yourself because you're friends with Tohsaka? Don't get ahead of yourself. Just because you're working with her doesn't make you hot shit. I know you're happy you have a strong Servant, but isn't it embarrassing to be so pleased with yourself?"::
30881::$$$message_0244_0010_0000$$$::Shinji glares back at me.[lr]::
30882::$$$message_0244_0010_0001$$$::Now it seems like he's lost all composure, which is really unlike him.[lr]::
30883::$$$message_0244_0010_0002$$$::"Whatever, I'm glad you came. It'd be boring if you didn't have front row seats, you know?"[lr]::
30884::$$$message_0244_0010_0003$$$::That must be all he wanted to say, as he goes back to his seat, chuckling.::
30885::$$$message_0244_0011_0000$$$::It's lunch break and the classroom gets louder.[lr]::
30886::$$$message_0244_0011_0001$$$::"...Huh? Issei's already gone."[lr]::
30887::$$$message_0244_0011_0002$$$::He must've gone to the student council room again to go nap.[lr]::
30888::$$$message_0244_0011_0003$$$::I made lunch again, so I would like to avoid eating in the classroom...::
30889::$$$message_0244_0012_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
30890::$$$message_0244_0012_0001$$$::The guys in the class are making a commotion.::
30891::$$$message_0244_0013_0000$$$::"Hey, what's going on?"[lr]::
30892::$$$message_0244_0013_0001$$$::I call out to them.[lr]::
30893::$$$message_0244_0013_0002$$$::The boys are huddled in a secret meeting and look at me suspiciously.::
30894::$$$message_0244_0014_0000$$$::"This is not the time, that it is not. Look outside the classroom. But do so secretly."[lr]::
30895::$$$message_0244_0014_0001$$$::Gotou must've been watching some kind of period drama last night, the way he's talking. Still, I do as he suggests.::
30896::$$$message_0244_0015_0000$$$::"...Wha[line2]"[lr]::
30897::$$$message_0244_0015_0001$$$::There...[lr]::
30898::$$$message_0244_0015_0002$$$::Outside the classroom in the hallway, someone's acting even more suspiciously than Gotou.::
30899::$$$message_0244_0016_0000$$$::"That's Tohsaka from 2-A, right? D-does she have some business with our class?"[lr]::
30900::$$$message_0244_0016_0001$$$::"There's no mistaking it. I've been watching carefully, that I have. She continually peers into our classroom. This is the seventh pass she's made. Now, eight."::
30901::$$$message_0244_0017_0000$$$::"Yeah, this ain't a coincidence anymore. Come to think of it, doesn't she have a real nasty look right now? Usually she's all composed, right?"[lr]::
30902::$$$message_0244_0017_0001$$$::"You thinking what I'm thinking? Because it looks to me like each time she passes by she looks even more pissed. I don't want any of that.[lr]::
30903::$$$message_0244_0017_0002$$$::She's super angry. What do you think has her panties in a twist?"::
30904::$$$message_0244_0018_0000$$$::"It's as if the one she awaits has yet to appear, and has not even noticed she waits. Like she has hidden away a birthday present, but now fumes over that person not noticing for an entire year."[lr]::
30905::$$$message_0244_0018_0001$$$::"Your metaphors are crazy, Gotou. Yet strangely on point.[lr]::
30906::$$$message_0244_0018_0002$$$::Were you some strategist or military advisor in a past life?"::
30907::$$$message_0244_0019_0000$$$::...The guys are saying whatever they want.[lr]::
30908::$$$message_0244_0019_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
30909::$$$message_0244_0019_0002$$$::I timidly look out to the hallway again.::
30910::$$$message_0244_0020_0000$$$::   She's pissed.[lr]::
30911::$$$message_0244_0020_0001$$$::I don't know what she's pissed at, but I feel like Gotou's guess is right.::
30912::$$$message_0244_0021_0000$$$::So...[lr]::
30913::$$$message_0244_0021_0001$$$::What should I do?[lr]ºœGÁ
