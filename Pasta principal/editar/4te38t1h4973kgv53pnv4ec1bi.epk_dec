64761::$$$message_0596_0000_0000$$$::The clock turns.[lr]::
64762::$$$message_0596_0000_0001$$$::It's past 9 o'clock.[lr]::
64763::$$$message_0596_0000_0002$$$::Two hours ago, I carried Sakura who had collapsed near the front door into the living room, as Tohsaka told me to.[lr]::
64764::$$$message_0596_0000_0003$$$::My paralyzed brain finally started working.::
64765::$$$message_0596_0001_0000$$$::"Hey, Shirou. Are you feeling better now?"[lr]::
64766::$$$message_0596_0001_0001$$$::"Mm, I think I'm back to normal. Sorry for making you worry, Illya. To be honest, I don't have any memory of the last two hours, so I don't know what stupid stuff I did."::
64767::$$$message_0596_0002_0000$$$::"Hmm. You didn't really do anything. You came in carrying Sakura and held her hand the whole time while Rin was treating her. Once we knew that she just had a high fever, you sat on the floor."::
64768::$$$message_0596_0003_0000$$$::"Oh. What about Tohsaka? I think she took Sakura to her bedroom."[lr]::
64769::$$$message_0596_0003_0001$$$::"Rin was looking through the closet in the tatami room.[lr]::
64770::$$$message_0596_0003_0002$$$::I bet she was looking for a change of clothes for Sakura. She came back all dirty, so we would need to change her before getting her to bed, right?"::
64771::$$$message_0596_0004_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64772::$$$message_0596_0004_0001$$$::I see.[lr]::
64773::$$$message_0596_0004_0002$$$::That makes sense.[lr]::
64774::$$$message_0596_0004_0003$$$::I'd have to stay in the living room, in that case.[lr]::
64775::$$$message_0596_0004_0004$$$::"Hey. I'm going to change her, and you're a guy, so why are you coming with us?"[lr]::
64776::$$$message_0596_0004_0005$$$::Tohsaka probably gave me such a warning.::
64777::$$$message_0596_0005_0000$$$::"So I've been waiting here for 2 hours, huh. Even if I was confused, that's still..."[lr]::
64778::$$$message_0596_0005_0001$$$::It makes me feel like an idiot.[lr]::
64779::$$$message_0596_0005_0002$$$::Seriously, what's going on with me today?[lr]::
64780::$$$message_0596_0005_0003$$$::There's so many things I should be thinking about.[lr]::
64781::$$$message_0596_0005_0004$$$::Sakura's well-being after she collapsed from a fever.[lr]::
64782::$$$message_0596_0005_0005$$$::The massive meal that the enemy had last night.::
64783::$$$message_0596_0006_0000$$$::...No, I can think about those later.[lr]::
64784::$$$message_0596_0006_0001$$$::Right now, I should be considering why Sakura was found outside the house, when she went to sleep next to[line2]::
64785::$$$message_0596_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64786::$$$message_0596_0007_0001$$$::I want to vomit.[lr]::
64787::$$$message_0596_0007_0002$$$::My thoughts deny each other.[lr]::
64788::$$$message_0596_0007_0003$$$::Two hours of lost time.[lr]::
64789::$$$message_0596_0007_0004$$$::That's how long I thought about that problem to the point of not wanting to anymore, my body reminds me...::
64790::$$$message_0596_0008_0000$$$::"Shirou. Don't try to remember things that you can't remember.[lr]::
64791::$$$message_0596_0008_0001$$$::You didn't forget it. It's just gone. When you try to dig up something that doesn't exist anymore, all you'll find is pain."[lr]::
64792::$$$message_0596_0008_0002$$$::"Huh...? Illya?"[lr]::
64793::$$$message_0596_0008_0003$$$::"...Never mind. I was just talking to myself. Forget it."[lr]::
64794::$$$message_0596_0008_0004$$$::Illya looks away and goes quiet.::
64795::$$$message_0596_0009_0000$$$::A few minutes pass.[lr]::
64796::$$$message_0596_0009_0001$$$::Around the time the hand on the clock points to ten...[lr]::
64797::$$$message_0596_0009_0002$$$::"Thanks for waiting. Sakura's awake."[lr]::
64798::$$$message_0596_0009_0003$$$::Tohsaka came in and said it like it was no big deal.::
64799::$$$message_0596_0010_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka. Is Sakura all right?"[lr]::
64800::$$$message_0596_0010_0001$$$::"Who knows? You should be asking her, not me. I don't think you should hear it from me."[lr]::
64801::$$$message_0596_0010_0002$$$::"...All right. I'm going to see her."[lr]::
64802::$$$message_0596_0010_0003$$$::I stand up.[lr]::
64803::$$$message_0596_0010_0004$$$::I leave Illya and Tohsaka in the living room and go to Sakura's bedroom.::
64804::$$$message_0596_0011_0000$$$::"Thank goodness. You came, Senpai."[lr]::
64805::$$$message_0596_0011_0001$$$::In bed,[lr]::
64806::$$$message_0596_0011_0002$$$::Sakura sees my face and makes a slightly pained sigh.::
64807::$$$message_0596_0012_0000$$$::"Of course I came, silly. You fainted. I'd come for you no matter where you are. Tohsaka beat me to it first, but it's my job to look after you when you're sick."::
64808::$$$message_0596_0013_0000$$$::I take a seat on the chair next to her bed.[lr]::
64809::$$$message_0596_0013_0001$$$::Sakura does her best to make eye contact from where she's lying.::
64810::$$$message_0596_0014_0000$$$::"So, how are you feeling? Tohsaka wouldn't tell me anything."[lr]::
64811::$$$message_0596_0014_0001$$$::"Oh, really? She didn't tell you?"::
64812::$$$message_0596_0015_0000$$$::"Nope. She said to ask you everything. I guess she was being considerate."[lr]::
64813::$$$message_0596_0015_0001$$$::"Hehe. You look a little happy, Senpai. I've wondered this for a while, but you like the way my sister is strict on you sometimes, don't you?"::
64814::$$$message_0596_0016_0000$$$::"A-as if![lr]::
64815::$$$message_0596_0016_0001$$$::Tohsaka's got a good head on her shoulders, but I couldn't take it if she were like that all the time! Besides, at times like these, it's that obvious consideration that keeps us sane. That goes for me and you."::
64816::$$$message_0596_0017_0000$$$::Sakura nods with a smile.[lr]::
64817::$$$message_0596_0017_0001$$$::Her expression looks so content, it makes me feel a little relieved.::
64818::$$$message_0596_0018_0000$$$::"Good, I feel better seeing you like this. What did Tohsaka say?"[lr]::
64819::$$$message_0596_0018_0001$$$::"Um, that my stamina is getting worse, I'm malnourished, and that I have a light fever.[lr]::
64820::$$$message_0596_0018_0002$$$::She also said that there's nothing to worry about as long as I'm sleeping enough, so I have to get bed rest all day."::
64821::$$$message_0596_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64822::$$$message_0596_0019_0001$$$::Sakura's breathing sounds labored even as she says that.[lr]::
64823::$$$message_0596_0019_0002$$$::...Is she having a hard time even when she's lying down?[lr]::
64824::$$$message_0596_0019_0003$$$::It seems like she's trying to control her breathing so that I don't worry.::
64825::$$$message_0596_0020_0000$$$::"Okay. Then keep lying down for now. Do you, um, have enough magical energy?"[lr]::
64826::$$$message_0596_0020_0001$$$::"Uh...ah, y-yes! I'm doing all right on that front th-thanks to you!"::
64827::$$$message_0596_0021_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64828::$$$message_0596_0021_0001$$$::I feel myself blushing as I ask.[lr]::
64829::$$$message_0596_0021_0002$$$::Still, it's something I need to be sure of, so I'll have to put up with it.::
64830::$$$message_0596_0022_0000$$$::"I bet you'll feel better once you get something good to eat. Hang on, I'll put everything I got into making you lunch."[lr]::
64831::$$$message_0596_0022_0001$$$::I roll up my sleeve reassuringly.[lr]::
64832::$$$message_0596_0022_0002$$$::However...::
64833::$$$message_0596_0023_0000$$$::"...I'm sorry. I should actually be the one cooking for you.[lr]::
64834::$$$message_0596_0023_0001$$$::...If I could stand up, I'd at least be able to help you, but I can't. It's frustrating."[lr]::
64835::$$$message_0596_0023_0002$$$::Apparently, they were hard words for Sakura to hear.::
64836::$$$message_0596_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64837::$$$message_0596_0024_0001$$$::...That's right.[lr]::
64838::$$$message_0596_0024_0002$$$::Sakura's worried about her role in our home.[lr]::
64839::$$$message_0596_0024_0003$$$::She wants to at least live life, even if she can't do anything about our situation.[lr]::
64840::$$$message_0596_0024_0004$$$::But she isn't even allowed to do simple things like cook anymore.::
64841::$$$message_0596_0025_0000$$$::"Just hang in there for now. When a sick person doesn't rest, they'll just get sicker. Don't you worry, I plan to ask you to cook three meals a day once you're all better. You'll regret that you didn't get any rest while you still could."::
64842::$$$message_0596_0026_0000$$$::I jokingly tell Sakura what's in store for her.[lr]::
64843::$$$message_0596_0026_0001$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
64844::$$$message_0596_0026_0002$$$::I'll let her have the kitchen for half a year, if that makes her happy.::
64845::$$$message_0596_0027_0000$$$::"Really? You won't go back on that, will you?"[lr]::
64846::$$$message_0596_0027_0001$$$::"Really. I'll behave for half a year, at least.[lr]::
64847::$$$message_0596_0027_0002$$$::Oh, no, I'll help you when things get hard. You should at least let me work in front of the stove."[lr]::
64848::$$$message_0596_0027_0003$$$::I've been standing in the kitchen for the last eight years, too.[lr]::
64849::$$$message_0596_0027_0004$$$::I need to hold a frying pan in my hands at least once in a while to feel at ease.::
64850::$$$message_0596_0028_0000$$$::"All right, it's a promise. Once I get better, please eat my food."[lr]::
64851::$$$message_0596_0028_0001$$$::"Yeah. I'll make you as many promises as you want."::
64852::$$$message_0596_0029_0000$$$::I stand up from the chair.[lr]::
64853::$$$message_0596_0029_0001$$$::I shouldn't tire Sakura out with any more conversation.[lr]::
64854::$$$message_0596_0029_0002$$$::We got to talk, and I confirmed that Sakura is safe.[lr]::
64855::$$$message_0596_0029_0003$$$::Now I need to let her rest.::
64856::$$$message_0596_0030_0000$$$::"I'll be back when it's lunch time, so try to sleep until then."[lr]::
64857::$$$message_0596_0030_0001$$$::I leave her bedside.[lr]::
64858::$$$message_0596_0030_0002$$$::Sakura nods without saying anything.::
64859::$$$message_0596_0031_0000$$$::"Oh right, Sakura..."[lr]::
64860::$$$message_0596_0031_0001$$$::As I reach for the doorknob, something occurs to me.::
64861::$$$message_0596_0032_0000$$$::"Yes? What, Senpai?"[lr]::
64862::$$$message_0596_0032_0001$$$::"I was just wondering why you were on the ground in front of the door.[lr]::
64863::$$$message_0596_0032_0002$$$::You went to sleep in my room last night, right?"[lr]::
64864::$$$message_0596_0032_0003$$$::I ask the question as casually as possible.[lr]::
64865::$$$message_0596_0032_0004$$$::After a slight pause, she answers.::
64866::$$$message_0596_0033_0000$$$::"I was out on a morning walk. I woke up earlier than you, so I decided to go outside. But then, I fainted.[lr]::
64867::$$$message_0596_0033_0001$$$::My sister's right. I really shouldn't go outside right now."[lr]::
64868::$$$message_0596_0033_0002$$$::She answers as brightly and naturally as I asked the question.::
