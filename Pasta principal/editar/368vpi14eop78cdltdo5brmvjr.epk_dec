16306::$$$message_0148_0000_0000$$$::I listen to the rain in Tohsaka's room.[lr]::
16307::$$$message_0148_0000_0001$$$::Today, under the pretense of a magecraft lesson, she performed yet another physical examination like yesterday. She gave me more medicine, then checked all my Magic Circuits.::
16308::$$$message_0148_0001_0000$$$::It's not that I mind doing this, I just...don't like the feeling that I'm not doing anything productive.[lr]::
16309::$$$message_0148_0001_0001$$$::She tells me not to move so she can see what happens to me, but that doesn't mean I can't talk.::
16310::$$$message_0148_0002_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. Do you have a minute?"[lr]::
16311::$$$message_0148_0002_0001$$$::I call out to her as I sit in my meditative pose.::
16312::$$$message_0148_0003_0000$$$::"Hm? What is it?"[lr]::
16313::$$$message_0148_0003_0001$$$::"It's about Saber.[lr]::
16314::$$$message_0148_0003_0002$$$::I really don't know how to explain it, but..."::
16315::$$$message_0148_0004_0000$$$::I realize I haven't thought this through at all.[lr]::
16316::$$$message_0148_0004_0001$$$::It's not even a question of, "What can I do for Saber?"[lr]::
16317::$$$message_0148_0004_0002$$$::I haven't even thought about what I want to do with her.::
16318::$$$message_0148_0005_0000$$$::"Um...well...I was just wondering what she wants to do.[lr]::
16319::$$$message_0148_0005_0001$$$::She's never told us anything she wants to do for herself. So..."::
16320::$$$message_0148_0006_0000$$$::"You don't know what Saber's thinking?"[lr]::
16321::$$$message_0148_0006_0001$$$::"Uh...no, it's not that. I just don't know why she's so selfless.[lr]::
16322::$$$message_0148_0006_0002$$$::Yeah...I just don't know what to do about that."::
16323::$$$message_0148_0007_0000$$$::"Huh. Well, you're right. The only thing she's done voluntarily is protect you. It may be a natural thing for a Servant to do, but I can't blame you for thinking that since she's so dedicated to doing it.[lr]::
16324::$$$message_0148_0007_0001$$$::But that doesn't mean she's selfless.[lr]::
16325::$$$message_0148_0007_0002$$$::Saber is protecting you because protecting you helps fulfill her goal."::
16326::$$$message_0148_0008_0000$$$::"Oh..."[lr]::
16327::$$$message_0148_0008_0001$$$::I completely forgot her reason for even becoming a Servant.::
16328::$$$message_0148_0009_0000$$$::"You're right. Saber wants to get the Holy Grail. So it's not like she doesn't have any goals."::
16329::$$$message_0148_0010_0000$$$::And that Holy Grail will grant its possessor's wish.[lr]::
16330::$$$message_0148_0010_0001$$$::That means Saber at least has a wish she wants granted.[lr]::
16331::$$$message_0148_0010_0002$$$::I don't know what it is, but she wants it enough to even become a Servant.[lr]::
16332::$$$message_0148_0010_0003$$$::So it must have some hope of saving her.::
16333::$$$message_0148_0011_0000$$$::Like, for example...[lr]::
16334::$$$message_0148_0011_0001$$$::She's here in this time period, and the power of the Holy Grail can help her so she can stay here and live a second life.[lr]::
16335::$$$message_0148_0011_0002$$$::And, she would have to wish for something that big, just to make up for all the suffering and tragedy she endured.::
16336::$$$message_0148_0012_0000$$$::"Oh. Then it's actually pretty simple!"[lr]::
16337::$$$message_0148_0012_0001$$$::"Huh? You're energetic all of a sudden... It's creeping me out. Were we talking about something fun, for you to get all excited like this?"::
16338::$$$message_0148_0013_0000$$$::"Yeah. I [font italic=true]am[font italic=false] getting excited. And yeah...she wouldn't be fighting so hard unless it was for something real big.[lr]::
16339::$$$message_0148_0013_0001$$$::After all, Saber needs to fight for her own wish!"::
16340::$$$message_0148_0014_0000$$$::I nod to myself.[lr]::
16341::$$$message_0148_0014_0001$$$::Tohsaka, on the other hand, seems utterly bewildered.::
16342::$$$message_0148_0015_0000$$$::"Emiya. Sorry to rain on your parade, but you're jumping to the wrong conclusion. Saber's not fighting for her own sake."::
16343::$$$message_0148_0016_0000$$$::"You understand that, right? Saber isn't like that. She doesn't want the Holy Grail for herself."::
16344::$$$message_0148_0017_0000$$$::"Wha...what's your reasoning?"[lr]::
16345::$$$message_0148_0017_0001$$$::...I can't even ask that.[lr]::
16346::$$$message_0148_0017_0002$$$::I know...[lr]::
16347::$$$message_0148_0017_0003$$$::She met her final moments alone BECAUSE she didn't have any desires for herself.[lr]::
16348::$$$message_0148_0017_0004$$$::So Saber wouldn't seek for her own salvation now.::
16349::$$$message_0148_0018_0000$$$::"...Ugh."[lr]::
16350::$$$message_0148_0018_0001$$$::But still...[lr]::
16351::$$$message_0148_0018_0002$$$::I hoped otherwise, even for a brief moment, so I pushed my distorted desire on her.::
16352::$$$message_0148_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
16353::$$$message_0148_0019_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
16354::$$$message_0148_0019_0002$$$::Our conversation trails off.[lr]::
16355::$$$message_0148_0019_0003$$$::Just as I think this awkward silence is going to continue forever...::
16356::$$$message_0148_0020_0000$$$::"This might be a boring story, but Archer actually said something similar to what you said."[lr]::
16357::$$$message_0148_0020_0001$$$::"Huh? Archer? You mean, your Archer?"::
16358::$$$message_0148_0021_0000$$$::"Yep. I once asked him what his wish was.[lr]::
16359::$$$message_0148_0021_0001$$$::And do you know what he said?"::
16360::$$$message_0148_0022_0000$$$::"Eh...um...I wouldn't have the slightest idea."[lr]::
16361::$$$message_0148_0022_0001$$$::I never knew a single thing about him.[lr]::
16362::$$$message_0148_0022_0002$$$::Archer once declared that we were bound to be enemies anyway, so he made no effort to communicate with Saber or me.[lr]::
16363::$$$message_0148_0022_0003$$$::And yet...[lr]::
16364::$$$message_0148_0022_0004$$$::He may have been cynical, but he didn't seem the sort to have stupid objectives in mind.::
16365::$$$message_0148_0023_0000$$$::"Get this...you're going to laugh... When I asked him what his wish was, he said,[lr]::
16366::$$$message_0148_0023_0001$$$::[font italic=true]'Hm. How about world peace, forever?'[font italic=false][lr]::
16367::$$$message_0148_0023_0002$$$::It was so ridiculous, I couldn't help laughing.[lr]::
16368::$$$message_0148_0023_0003$$$::But then he got all weird and said, [font italic=true]'I knew you'd laugh. Well, you know there's no meaning in gaining salvation from others. Fine, let's just say this was a joke and leave it at that.'[font italic=false]"::
16369::$$$message_0148_0024_0000$$$::"It made me think that that's probably why a guy like him became a Heroic Spirit to get ordered around by a girl like me."::
16370::$$$message_0148_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
16371::$$$message_0148_0025_0001$$$::I see.[lr]::
16372::$$$message_0148_0025_0002$$$::He didn't look it, but he was a great, proud knight in his own right.::
16373::$$$message_0148_0026_0000$$$::"But don't get the wrong idea. If the Holy Grail really grants any wish, permanent world peace would be the worst one. [lr]::
16374::$$$message_0148_0026_0001$$$::It'd just mean nothing happens. If there was no conflict in the world, that'd be as good as death. If nothing happens, the only thing is to rot away from stagnation."::
16375::$$$message_0148_0027_0000$$$::"Huh. Did you tell Archer that too?"[lr]::
16376::$$$message_0148_0027_0001$$$::"I did. And he said, [font italic=true]'That's what the wise would think.[font italic=false][lr]::
16377::$$$message_0148_0027_0002$$$::[font italic=true]I agree, but I'm still going to follow this dream, even if it is a fool's dream.'[font italic=false]"::
16378::$$$message_0148_0028_0000$$$::"Then I pressed him about whether he had any other wishes, and he said, [font italic=true]'I do, but it's not a wish that should be granted by the Holy Grail. So I'll let you make your own wish in my place.'[font italic=false][lr]::
16379::$$$message_0148_0028_0001$$$::Pretty pretentious, right? I bet he was quite the womanizer while he was alive."::
16380::$$$message_0148_0029_0000$$$::"Huh. I really didn't get that impression from him. But what's your point here, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
16381::$$$message_0148_0029_0001$$$::"Nothing in particular. I was just saying that there are different kinds of Servants."::
16382::$$$message_0148_0030_0000$$$::Is that so?[lr]::
16383::$$$message_0148_0030_0001$$$::Well, I guess it was good for me to know, so it was at least kinda helpful.::
16384::$$$message_0148_0031_0000$$$::"Then let's move on to the next topic.[lr]::
16385::$$$message_0148_0031_0001$$$::Well, actually this is mostly about Saber anyway."::
16386::$$$message_0148_0032_0000$$$::"Huh? I do remember you saying you wanted to talk to me about something this morning."::
16387::$$$message_0148_0033_0000$$$::"Yes. It's nothing big, but I was curious...[lr]::
16388::$$$message_0148_0033_0001$$$::Might be a bit late in the game for this, but do you know the legend of King Arthur?"[lr]::
16389::$$$message_0148_0033_0002$$$::   The legend of King Arthur...[lr]::
16390::$$$message_0148_0033_0003$$$::I've been reminded of it more than enough in the past few days.::
16391::$$$message_0148_0034_0000$$$::"I know as much as the next person. Although, I didn't know King Arthur was a girl."::
16392::$$$message_0148_0035_0000$$$::"Right. Her sex doesn't matter though.[lr]::
16393::$$$message_0148_0035_0001$$$::King Arthur being a girl wouldn't change the legend. As long as King Arthur managed to hide that fact from everyone, she would be treated as a man anyway."::
16394::$$$message_0148_0036_0000$$$::"Fortunately, King Arthur had a mage called Merlin in his service. Merlin was truly devilish[line2]half incubus, actually[line2]so it would have been easy for him to hide King Arthur's sex, or prepare a child who shouldn't have been born."::
16395::$$$message_0148_0037_0000$$$::"Yeah, I bet. So?"[lr]::
16396::$$$message_0148_0037_0001$$$::"So my concern is the discrepancy between the legend and the Saber we have in front of us.[lr]::
16397::$$$message_0148_0037_0002$$$::Emiya. Do you know what Excalibur was?"::
16398::$$$message_0148_0038_0000$$$::"Why ask this now? Excalibur is a symbol of King Arthur. It's the sword fairies gave her, famed for being able to cut through anything without ever dulling."[lr]::
16399::$$$message_0148_0038_0001$$$::"Yeah, that's about what I figured you'd say."[lr]::
16400::$$$message_0148_0038_0002$$$::Tohsaka looks oddly triumphant.::
16401::$$$message_0148_0039_0000$$$::"Huh? Was that a weird thing to say?"[lr]::
16402::$$$message_0148_0039_0001$$$::"Yes. You and King Arthur made the same mistake. If Merlin was around, he would probably mock you for being a fool."::
16403::$$$message_0148_0040_0000$$$::"Why's that?[lr]::
16404::$$$message_0148_0040_0001$$$::Um...the sword in the stone wasn't Excalibur. That sword broke. He later received another sword from a fairy in the lake, and that was Excalibur, right?"::
16405::$$$message_0148_0041_0000$$$::"Yep. When King Arthur received Excalibur, Merlin asked,[lr]::
16406::$$$message_0148_0041_0001$$$::[font italic=true]'My king, which do you prefer?[font italic=false][lr]::
16407::$$$message_0148_0041_0002$$$::[font italic=true]The sword or the sheath?'[font italic=false]"::
16408::$$$message_0148_0042_0000$$$::"King Arthur answered 'the sword' without a moment's hesitation. But Merlin scolded the king for that.[lr]::
16409::$$$message_0148_0042_0001$$$::[font italic=true]'Do not mistake their worth; the sword may cut your enemies, but the sheath protects you. So long as you possess that sheath, you will spill not a single drop of blood, nor sustain any injury. The sheath, rather than the blade, is what you should value.'[font italic=false]"::
16410::$$$message_0148_0043_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
16411::$$$message_0148_0043_0001$$$::Tohsaka skillfully acts out the parts of King Arthur and Merlin.::
16412::$$$message_0148_0044_0000$$$::"Look at you, Tohsaka, you're getting into the part.[lr]::
16413::$$$message_0148_0044_0001$$$::   So what's your point?"::
16414::$$$message_0148_0045_0000$$$::"Oh come on, do you STILL not get it!? It means King Arthur is immortal! Excalibur is an invincible Noble Phantasm, in both offense and defense![lr]::
16415::$$$message_0148_0045_0001$$$::Which is why Saber should be able to heal immediately!"::
16416::$$$message_0148_0046_0000$$$::"Tohsaka...Saber's wounds do heal."::
16417::$$$message_0148_0047_0000$$$::"Yes, that's true, but Saber's self-healing abilities come from using a great amount of magical energy. And that sounds like it's separate from the sheath of the legendary Excalibur."::
16418::$$$message_0148_0048_0000$$$::"I see. If you say so, it's probably true.[lr]::
16419::$$$message_0148_0048_0001$$$::Then here's my question.[lr]::
16420::$$$message_0148_0048_0002$$$::You say that King Arthur is immortal, so then why and how did King Arthur die? The legend ends with King Arthur's death, right?"::
16421::$$$message_0148_0049_0000$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
16422::$$$message_0148_0049_0001$$$::Tohsaka's mouth drops open.[lr]::
16423::$$$message_0148_0049_0002$$$::After freezing up for a few seconds, she grinds her teeth and looks away.::
16424::$$$message_0148_0050_0000$$$::"Oh right...Excalibur's sheath was stolen..."[lr]::
16425::$$$message_0148_0050_0001$$$::Ah, rookie mistake right there.[lr]::
16426::$$$message_0148_0050_0002$$$::I'd forgotten, but according to legend, King Arthur's fate was sealed the moment the king lost the all-important sheath.::
16427::$$$message_0148_0051_0000$$$::"So are you convinced now, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
16428::$$$message_0148_0051_0001$$$::"Yeah, yeah...go ahead and make fun of me if you want."::
16429::$$$message_0148_0052_0000$$$::She doesn't mean that.[lr]::
16430::$$$message_0148_0052_0001$$$::I can tell she's ready to kick me in the head the moment I laugh at her.::
16431::$$$message_0148_0053_0000$$$::"It's all good as long as you understand now. But why did that bother you so much? It shouldn't matter to you whether Saber gets hurt or not."::
16432::$$$message_0148_0054_0000$$$::"Sh-shut up! I might've just gotten a little...arrogant, thinking she would be invincible if that were the case.[lr]::
16433::$$$message_0148_0054_0001$$$::I make mistakes sometimes too, you know!"::
16434::$$$message_0148_0055_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
16435::$$$message_0148_0055_0001$$$::This is a tough one.[lr]::
16436::$$$message_0148_0055_0002$$$::Would there be any benefit in me pointing out that she makes mistakes [font italic=true]a lot[font italic=false], not just sometimes?::
