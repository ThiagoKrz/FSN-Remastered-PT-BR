64405::$$$message_0591_0000_0000$$$::This is clearly a trap.[lr]::
64406::$$$message_0591_0000_0001$$$::I'm curious about what Zouken has to say, but I can't leave Sakura right now.::
64407::$$$message_0591_0001_0000$$$::"I refuse. I don't trust you. Tell him to come here if he wants to talk."[lr]::
64408::$$$message_0591_0001_0001$$$::"I see. Then I shall relay your message."::
64409::$$$message_0591_0002_0000$$$::That's all Assassin says before he disappears.[lr]::
64410::$$$message_0591_0002_0001$$$::He's probably on the way back to Zouken by now.::
64411::$$$message_0591_0003_0000$$$::"...Good. I made the right choice."[lr]::
64412::$$$message_0591_0003_0001$$$::Even if I got to meet Zouken alone, I have no way to defeat him.[lr]::
64413::$$$message_0591_0003_0002$$$::And he's a monster that can't be reasoned with.[lr]::
64414::$$$message_0591_0003_0003$$$::I shouldn't face Zouken until we have all of our weapons at the ready.::
64415::$$$message_0591_0004_0000$$$::"...The Jeweled Sword, huh."[lr]::
64416::$$$message_0591_0004_0001$$$::It's the name of the trump card that Tohsaka and Illya are trying to make.[lr]::
64417::$$$message_0591_0004_0002$$$::Archer's arm contains records of a thousand or more famous, magical swords, but this isn't among them.::
64418::$$$message_0591_0005_0000$$$::"...But we can win if I replicate this. I can believe in that, right, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
64419::$$$message_0591_0005_0001$$$::I rest my heavy body on the ground.[lr]::
64420::$$$message_0591_0005_0002$$$::...I'm a little tired. I should sleep.[lr]::
64421::$$$message_0591_0005_0003$$$::Once I wake up, I can check on Sakura, make some food, and help Tohsaka and Illya with their work...::
64422::$$$message_0591_0006_0000$$$::"Mm...mm."[lr]::
64423::$$$message_0591_0006_0001$$$::I awaken to the presence of dinner.[lr]::
64424::$$$message_0591_0006_0002$$$::Dinner has a "presence", of course. It's the sound of a chef knife on a cutting board, the low chatter of the TV, and the smell of delicious food in the making.::
64425::$$$message_0591_0007_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
64426::$$$message_0591_0007_0001$$$::I find Sakura's pajamas, an empty bowl, and a wet towel in the room.::
64427::$$$message_0591_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64428::$$$message_0591_0008_0001$$$::I search my memory.[lr]::
64429::$$$message_0591_0008_0002$$$::Based on the situation, I checked on Sakura sometime in the afternoon.[lr]::
64430::$$$message_0591_0008_0003$$$::I try to recall the details, but stop.[lr]::
64431::$$$message_0591_0008_0004$$$::That doesn't matter now.[lr]::
64432::$$$message_0591_0008_0005$$$::It just slipped my mind, so it isn't worth thinking about now.::
64433::$$$message_0591_0009_0000$$$::Tohsaka must be making dinner.[lr]::
64434::$$$message_0591_0009_0001$$$::Sakura and Illya aren't here.[lr]::
64435::$$$message_0591_0009_0002$$$::Sakura must be in her bedroom, while Illya's in the tatami room.::
64436::$$$message_0591_0010_0000$$$::"Huh? You're back? You said you were going to take a break since you're tired."[lr]::
64437::$$$message_0591_0010_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64438::$$$message_0591_0010_0002$$$::My face stiffens for an instant.[lr]::
64439::$$$message_0591_0010_0003$$$::"Nah, I'll help. You must be tired, too. Sorry for dumping it all on you."[lr]::
64440::$$$message_0591_0010_0004$$$::I respond as naturally as I can to avoid suspicion.::
64441::$$$message_0591_0011_0000$$$::"Dummy. I appreciate the thought, but you can't even hold a knife with that arm. I've got tonight, so go and rest."[lr]::
64442::$$$message_0591_0011_0001$$$::I hear the satisfying sound of knife on cutting board.[lr]::
64443::$$$message_0591_0011_0002$$$::Tohsaka's finely slicing a lot of bell peppers. Maybe we're having vegetable stir-fry tonight.::
64444::$$$message_0591_0012_0000$$$::"...Oh, I should get ready to take a bath. I'll take care of the laundry too, so can I take in your clothes?"[lr]::
64445::$$$message_0591_0012_0001$$$::"O-of course not, you idiot! I'll do that myself!"[lr]::
64446::$$$message_0591_0012_0002$$$::The sound of the knife becomes fierce and gallant.[lr]::
64447::$$$message_0591_0012_0003$$$::Tohsaka's cutting beef into chunks. Maybe we're having beef for dinner.::
64448::$$$message_0591_0013_0000$$$::"I wonder which it is."[lr]::
64449::$$$message_0591_0013_0001$$$::I grumble as I start to make my way to the bathroom.[lr]::
64450::$$$message_0591_0013_0002$$$::Whatever we're having, I'm looking forward to the final[line2]::
64451::$$$message_0591_0014_0000$$$::"Eh...?"[lr]::
64452::$$$message_0591_0014_0001$$$::The lights go out on their own.[lr]::
64453::$$$message_0591_0014_0002$$$::"Is it a power outage...?"::
64454::$$$message_0591_0015_0000$$$::"...Looks like it. I didn't touch the light switch."[lr]::
64455::$$$message_0591_0015_0001$$$::"...Yeah. There was no response from the Bounded Field, so it can't be an intruder."[lr]::
64456::$$$message_0591_0015_0002$$$::"Yeah. Even if Zouken attacks, we'd at least hear an alarm[line2]"::
64457::$$$message_0591_0016_0000$$$::No, we wouldn't.[lr]::
64458::$$$message_0591_0016_0001$$$::Remember what happened this morning.[lr]::
64459::$$$message_0591_0016_0002$$$::Assassin might be able to breach the Emiya house's Bounded Field without setting it off!::
64460::$$$message_0591_0017_0000$$$::"Stay here, Tohsaka. I'm going to check on things, just in case."[lr]::
64461::$$$message_0591_0017_0001$$$::"Huh...? Hold on, I should go too. It's dangerous on your own."::
64462::$$$message_0591_0018_0000$$$::"Oh, right... No, you should go to Sakura. I'll join you once I get Illya."[lr]::
64463::$$$message_0591_0018_0001$$$::"Okay. I got Sakura."::
64464::$$$message_0591_0019_0000$$$::I go to Illya's tatami room.[lr]::
64465::$$$message_0591_0019_0001$$$::It's quiet, but the house feels the way it always does.[lr]::
64466::$$$message_0591_0019_0002$$$::"Maybe I'm overthinking it. It's just a blackout."[lr]::
64467::$$$message_0591_0019_0003$$$::Still, I should wake Illya up while I'm at it.[lr]::
64468::$$$message_0591_0019_0004$$$::Even if the power's out, it's almost time for dinner.::
64469::$$$message_0591_0020_0000$$$::"Illya, are you awake?"[lr]::
64470::$$$message_0591_0020_0001$$$::I slide open the door.[lr]::
64471::$$$message_0591_0020_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64472::$$$message_0591_0020_0003$$$::I'm greeted by a vicious mural of bloodstains.::
64473::$$$message_0591_0021_0000$$$::"Illya..."[lr]::
64474::$$$message_0591_0021_0001$$$::Illya isn't here.[lr]::
64475::$$$message_0591_0021_0002$$$::All I see in the room is blood.[lr]::
64476::$$$message_0591_0021_0003$$$::I think I see something that looks like a bundle of silver thread in the corner of the blood-drenched room, but that isn't Illya.[lr]::
64477::$$$message_0591_0021_0004$$$::It's not Illya anymore.::
64478::$$$message_0591_0022_0000$$$::I run out of the room.[lr]::
64479::$$$message_0591_0022_0001$$$::My [block len=2]mind has gone stone cold, and I head for the guestrooms.[lr]::
64480::$$$message_0591_0022_0002$$$::   Sakura's in danger.[lr]::
64481::$$$message_0591_0022_0003$$$::I grasp the situation in a second without really understanding anything at all, and take the shortest path through the backyard.::
64482::$$$message_0591_0023_0000$$$::There...[lr]::
64483::$$$message_0591_0023_0001$$$::I see something that shouldn't exist.::
64484::$$$message_0591_0024_0000$$$::"...Oh."[lr]::
64485::$$$message_0591_0024_0001$$$::It's like the story about that ghost under a willow tree.[lr]::
64486::$$$message_0591_0024_0002$$$::Why didn't the Bounded Field react?[lr]::
64487::$$$message_0591_0024_0003$$$::What is this thing doing here?[lr]::
64488::$$$message_0591_0024_0004$$$::Before I even process my own question,[lr]::
64489::$$$message_0591_0024_0005$$$::I lose any chance to flee, any avenue of escape.[lr]::
64490::$$$message_0591_0024_0006$$$::Shadows already cover the entire house.[lr]::
64491::$$$message_0591_0024_0007$$$::It's made of shadow, so there's no getting away from it in the lightless night.::
64492::$$$message_0591_0025_0000$$$::I learned that last night.[lr]::
64493::$$$message_0591_0025_0001$$$::The second I run into this thing, my life is over.::
64494::$$$message_0591_0026_0000$$$::The ribbon-like tentacles impale me through the chest like a crowbar.[lr]::
64495::$$$message_0591_0026_0001$$$::It easily tears me open,[lr]::
64496::$$$message_0591_0026_0002$$$::like a blooming red flower.[lr]::
64497::$$$message_0591_0026_0003$$$::This must be how Illya stopped being Illya.::
64498::$$$message_0591_0027_0000$$$::Petals gush out in a red spray.[lr]::
64499::$$$message_0591_0027_0001$$$::Shirou Emiya's body has no way to stop itself from being instantly torn to pieces.U‡‡|
