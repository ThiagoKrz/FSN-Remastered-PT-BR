65273::$$$message_0600_0000_0000$$$::It's 2:00 PM.[lr]::
65274::$$$message_0600_0000_0001$$$::I make a late lunch and bring it to Sakura's room.::
65275::$$$message_0600_0001_0000$$$::"...Okay."[lr]::
65276::$$$message_0600_0001_0001$$$::I remove my apron and place a bowl of okayu on a tray.[lr]::
65277::$$$message_0600_0001_0002$$$::I take one deep breath,[lr]::
65278::$$$message_0600_0001_0003$$$::and completely still my heart.::
65279::$$$message_0600_0002_0000$$$::I don't know what I'll say if I see Sakura in my current condition.[lr]::
65280::$$$message_0600_0002_0001$$$::That wouldn't be good.[lr]::
65281::$$$message_0600_0002_0002$$$::If she notices my inner turmoil, it'll make her suffer even worse than me.::
65282::$$$message_0600_0003_0000$$$::I need to cool my emotions so that I don't say anything careless.[lr]::
65283::$$$message_0600_0003_0001$$$::...This will probably be the last time.[lr]::
65284::$$$message_0600_0003_0002$$$::It's our last chance to meet and look at each other, like we always have.[lr]::
65285::$$$message_0600_0003_0003$$$::At the very least, I want this precious time to end with a smile.::
65286::$$$message_0600_0004_0000$$$::"Are you awake, Sakura? I brought lunch. Sorry it's late."[lr]::
65287::$$$message_0600_0004_0001$$$::I knock and enter the room.[lr]::
65288::$$$message_0600_0004_0002$$$::Sakura looks like she was sleeping, but her face lights up when I come in.[lr]::
65289::$$$message_0600_0004_0003$$$::"Yes! I'm glad you came, Senpai!"[lr]::
65290::$$$message_0600_0004_0004$$$::She smiles warmly, looking genuinely happy.::
65291::$$$message_0600_0005_0000$$$::...Time passes.[lr]::
65292::$$$message_0600_0005_0001$$$::Sakura's body is on the mend.[lr]::
65293::$$$message_0600_0005_0002$$$::She's well enough to sit up and eat her okayu on her own.::
65294::$$$message_0600_0006_0000$$$::We spend lunchtime leisurely, chatting about nothing important.[lr]::
65295::$$$message_0600_0006_0001$$$::Sakura goes back to her bed and continues talking to me. Maybe she's sleepy after eating.[lr]::
65296::$$$message_0600_0006_0002$$$::That's all.[lr]::
65297::$$$message_0600_0006_0003$$$::This is all I can do for her now.::
65298::$$$message_0600_0007_0000$$$::Sakura looks lively now.[lr]::
65299::$$$message_0600_0007_0001$$$::Her breathing is steadier now, and the color has returned to her cheeks.[lr]::
65300::$$$message_0600_0007_0002$$$::I'd have a hard time believing someone who told me that she only has a few days left to live.::
65301::$$$message_0600_0008_0000$$$::"I've never really caught a cold before, you know.[lr]::
65302::$$$message_0600_0008_0001$$$::I've always had a good constitution, and I've certainly never been bedridden."::
65303::$$$message_0600_0009_0000$$$::The topic turns from disliking cold medicine to Sakura telling me how healthy she normally is.[lr]::
65304::$$$message_0600_0009_0001$$$::Apparently, she's never been a sickly person, and anytime she came close to catching a cold, she would overcome her symptoms through sheer willpower.::
65305::$$$message_0600_0010_0000$$$::"By 'willpower,' do you mean staying warm and resting?[lr]::
65306::$$$message_0600_0010_0001$$$::...No, that doesn't really capture the nuance of it, does it? How do you show willpower when you have a cold?"[lr]::
65307::$$$message_0600_0010_0002$$$::"Uh, well... it's pretty embarrassing, so this is a secret."::
65308::$$$message_0600_0011_0000$$$::Sakura gives me a rare shy giggle.[lr]::
65309::$$$message_0600_0011_0001$$$::...Hm. It sounds like Sakura was a feisty kid in a different way than I was.::
65310::$$$message_0600_0012_0000$$$::"I don't dislike cold medicine so much as I don't really believe in it. Doesn't it make you nervous when you aren't sure if it's even working after you take it?"::
65311::$$$message_0600_0013_0000$$$::"Ahh, I did think that as a kid. When you drink that bitter stuff and you don't feel any better, and you get a fever and hurt all over, you start to wonder if it's the medicine's fault."::
65312::$$$message_0600_0014_0000$$$::Sakura agrees enthusiastically with an "I know, right!?"[lr]::
65313::$$$message_0600_0014_0001$$$::...Her smile is almost enough to make me imagine that she's well enough to be back on her feet tomorrow.::
65314::$$$message_0600_0015_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65315::$$$message_0600_0015_0001$$$::...I do my best to quash that wishful thinking.[lr]::
65316::$$$message_0600_0015_0002$$$::Sakura won't get better.[lr]::
65317::$$$message_0600_0015_0003$$$::I can't keep hoping that she'll get better and everything will go back to normal, and keep delaying my decision.::
65318::$$$message_0600_0016_0000$$$::"...Hey, Sakura."[lr]::
65319::$$$message_0600_0016_0001$$$::Maybe I ask this because I've accepted the cold, hard reality.[lr]::
65320::$$$message_0600_0016_0002$$$::"Once you get better...is there anything you want to do?"[lr]::
65321::$$$message_0600_0016_0003$$$::I start imagining what-if,[lr]::
65322::$$$message_0600_0016_0004$$$::and ask her about fantasies of the future.::
65323::$$$message_0600_0017_0000$$$::"Huh...? Something I want to do...?"[lr]::
65324::$$$message_0600_0017_0001$$$::"Yeah. Things that you think are fun. It can be anything. I'm just asking, so it doesn't matter whether it's realistic."[lr]::
65325::$$$message_0600_0017_0002$$$::"Uh... Hmm, give me a moment."[lr]::
65326::$$$message_0600_0017_0003$$$::Sakura's gaze wanders, her face troubled.::
65327::$$$message_0600_0018_0000$$$::She pauses to think.[lr]::
65328::$$$message_0600_0018_0001$$$::"I don't think I've ever said this before, actually.[lr]::
65329::$$$message_0600_0018_0002$$$::I think I'd be happy staying right here, as long as you're with me."[lr]::
65330::$$$message_0600_0018_0003$$$::She answers shyly, her cheeks flushing.::
65331::$$$message_0600_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65332::$$$message_0600_0019_0001$$$::My vision narrows.[lr]::
65333::$$$message_0600_0019_0002$$$::I use my stilled heart to quash the urge to pick her up and hug her.::
65334::$$$message_0600_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]"Until now, she has never acted in her own interests."[font italic=false]::
65335::$$$message_0600_0021_0000$$$::Damn that old man! It's not that she never tried...![lr]::
65336::$$$message_0600_0021_0001$$$::She just doesn't know![lr]::
65337::$$$message_0600_0021_0002$$$::She doesn't know what it means to do something fun.[lr]::
65338::$$$message_0600_0021_0003$$$::She doesn't know what she wants because she's never lived a normal life.[lr]::
65339::$$$message_0600_0021_0004$$$::She values the small things so much because she's never known normal happiness...::
65340::$$$message_0600_0022_0000$$$::"...Senpai? Um, is something wrong?"[lr]::
65341::$$$message_0600_0022_0001$$$::"Huh? Oh, I was just thinking about something."::
65342::$$$message_0600_0023_0000$$$::She still hasn't done anything.[lr]::
65343::$$$message_0600_0023_0001$$$::Sakura doesn't know what it means to aspire to something, or to feel the need to obtain something.::
65344::$$$message_0600_0024_0000$$$::She doesn't laugh when she's outside.[lr]::
65345::$$$message_0600_0024_0001$$$::She doesn't make friends.[lr]::
65346::$$$message_0600_0024_0002$$$::She's only known closed-off spaces, like the Matou house and mine.[lr]::
65347::$$$message_0600_0024_0003$$$::I'd pay any price to change that.::
65348::$$$message_0600_0025_0000$$$::"S-Senpai? You're acting strange.[lr]::
65349::$$$message_0600_0025_0001$$$::...Does your left hand hurt?"[lr]::
65350::$$$message_0600_0025_0002$$$::"No, it's not that.[lr]::
65351::$$$message_0600_0025_0003$$$::Sakura. Once this commotion is over, let's go someplace far away.[lr]::
65352::$$$message_0600_0025_0004$$$::You've never taken a vacation anywhere, have you? It could be fun to go on a trip."::
65353::$$$message_0600_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65354::$$$message_0600_0026_0001$$$::Sakura looks at me curiously.[lr]::
65355::$$$message_0600_0026_0002$$$::Her surprised silence at my sudden suggestion gives the impression that she's wondering if this is a dream.::
65356::$$$message_0600_0027_0000$$$::"It's decided, then. Where do you want to go?"[lr]::
65357::$$$message_0600_0027_0001$$$::"Huh? Where? Um..."[lr]::
65358::$$$message_0600_0027_0002$$$::She looks panicked.[lr]::
65359::$$$message_0600_0027_0003$$$::She can't come up with an answer.[lr]::
65360::$$$message_0600_0027_0004$$$::Still, perhaps she found a wish within herself.::
65361::$$$message_0600_0028_0000$$$::"...Can it be anywhere?"[lr]::
65362::$$$message_0600_0028_0001$$$::She timidly looks up at me.::
65363::$$$message_0600_0029_0000$$$::"Sure. There's nowhere humans can't go when we set our minds to it."[lr]::
65364::$$$message_0600_0029_0001$$$::I meant it seriously, but Sakura seems to have taken it as a joke.[lr]::
65365::$$$message_0600_0029_0002$$$::She laughs.[lr]::
65366::$$$message_0600_0029_0003$$$::"Then I'd like to go flower-viewing in the spring."[lr]::
65367::$$$message_0600_0029_0004$$$::She voices a modest wish in a grateful tone.::
65368::$$$message_0600_0030_0000$$$::"Flower-viewing? Like for hanami, during the cherry blossom season?"[lr]::
65369::$$$message_0600_0030_0001$$$::"Yes. We could do it at this house, but all we have are plum trees. I want to go see the flowers with you in a big field on a sunny day."::
65370::$$$message_0600_0031_0000$$$::"...All right. That does sound..."[lr]::
65371::$$$message_0600_0031_0001$$$::Like an incredibly fun time.[lr]::
65372::$$$message_0600_0031_0002$$$::It would be nice to go look at the springtime trees at the park under the bridge, on a bright blue day without any clouds.[lr]::
65373::$$$message_0600_0031_0003$$$::There's countless fun things we could do.[lr]::
65374::$$$message_0600_0031_0004$$$::Hanami would be a perfect first outing for Sakura.::
65375::$$$message_0600_0032_0000$$$::"...Okay, it's a promise. Once you get better and this is all over, we'll go together."[lr]::
65376::$$$message_0600_0032_0001$$$::Sakura flashes a contented smile.[lr]::
65377::$$$message_0600_0032_0002$$$::We exchange a promise, and then I slowly stand up.::
65378::$$$message_0600_0033_0000$$$::...Yeah.[lr]::
65379::$$$message_0600_0033_0001$$$::It would be a dream come true if that could happen.[lr]::
65380::$$$message_0600_0033_0002$$$::A dream of my own happiness, which I've never had ever since that fire ten years ago.::
65381::$$$message_0600_0034_0000$$$::I leave the guestroom.[lr]::
65382::$$$message_0600_0034_0001$$$::All that's left is that humble promise.[lr]::
65383::$$$message_0600_0034_0002$$$::It isn't only Sakura's wish. It's mine, too.[lr]::
65384::$$$message_0600_0034_0003$$$::Once April comes, I'll grant it as many times as it takes.::
65385::$$$message_0600_0035_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
65386::$$$message_0600_0035_0001$$$::A warm illusion forms in my cold heart.::
65387::$$$message_0600_0036_0000$$$::Winter will end someday.[lr]::
65388::$$$message_0600_0036_0001$$$::And we'll go look at the cherry blossoms together, once the new spring comes.::
