40465::$$$message_0350_0000_0000$$$::Well.[lr]::
40466::$$$message_0350_0000_0001$$$::Now we're drinking tea together after dinner.::
40467::$$$message_0350_0001_0000$$$::"So Projection has its limitations.[lr]::
40468::$$$message_0350_0001_0001$$$::It looks like its powers are unlimited since it makes things you imagine real, but it has its own set of rules.[lr]::
40469::$$$message_0350_0001_0002$$$::The easiest thing to understand in those rules is the durability of the things Projected. It's the strength of its existence."[lr]::
40470::$$$message_0350_0001_0003$$$::Tohsaka puts up a finger while she drinks her tea.::
40471::$$$message_0350_0002_0000$$$::"Strength of its existence...? What? You mean its flimsiness in being unable to bear an existence of the illusion?"[lr]::
40472::$$$message_0350_0002_0001$$$::I sip on my green tea and tilt my head in response,::
40473::$$$message_0350_0003_0000$$$::"...For someone who doesn't seem to know anything, you sure do know some boring terms... But well, you're not right, but you're not wrong.[lr]::
40474::$$$message_0350_0003_0001$$$::Projection is where you completely reproduce the real thing from your own imagination. There is no exception to this.[lr]::
40475::$$$message_0350_0003_0002$$$::You can't Project it if it's not perfect inside of you. As it is a shadow of the true object, Projection magecraft doesn't even allow a minute to waste."::
40476::$$$message_0350_0004_0000$$$::"So... Basically, things created by Projection has the same strength as you imagine it. In the regard of an illusion, it's perfect.[lr]::
40477::$$$message_0350_0004_0001$$$::Additionally, the closer the mage's image and knowledge is to the real thing, it becomes perfect in reality as well."::
40478::$$$message_0350_0005_0000$$$::"...Mm? Hold on, that's weird.[lr]::
40479::$$$message_0350_0005_0001$$$::I Projected Archer's swords. But, Kuzuki destroyed them.[lr]::
40480::$$$message_0350_0005_0002$$$::I know Caster Strengthened Kuzuki's fists, but they aren't strong enough to destroy a Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
40481::$$$message_0350_0005_0003$$$::Doesn't that mean that Archer's Kanshou and Bakuya that I Projected is inferior by several ranks to the original ones?"::
40482::$$$message_0350_0006_0000$$$::"Yes, you realized a good point, Emiya.[lr]::
40483::$$$message_0350_0006_0001$$$::That's the limitation of Projection, the strength of its existence.[lr]::
40484::$$$message_0350_0006_0002$$$::You see, Projection is just Projection. It's not creation. What creates the Projection is the mage's image, so when there's a flaw in the image itself, it vanishes even if it has the same ability as the real thing."::
40485::$$$message_0350_0007_0000$$$::"...Hm? A flaw in the image...? Isn't that weird too? If the image is wrong, then you can't Project it in the first place."::
40486::$$$message_0350_0008_0000$$$::"Right. That's why the flaw is created after it is Projected.[lr]::
40487::$$$message_0350_0008_0001$$$::...Let's see. For example, let's say you Projected 'the famous sword that would never break.'"[lr]::
40488::$$$message_0350_0008_0002$$$::I nod.[lr]::
40489::$$$message_0350_0008_0003$$$::Tohsaka nods in satisfaction.::
40490::$$$message_0350_0009_0000$$$::"But, there's no such thing as a sword that never breaks.[lr]::
40491::$$$message_0350_0009_0001$$$::Just by having a personality trait of never breaking in its expression method, tradition, and sales pitch, it can chip or break if it comes across an illusion greater than itself."::
40492::$$$message_0350_0010_0000$$$::"...Hm? Doesn't that mean that my image was wrong if it breaks? Since I made a sword that won't break, right?"::
40493::$$$message_0350_0011_0000$$$::"It doesn't.[lr]::
40494::$$$message_0350_0011_0001$$$::At the point that it succeeded, there's no mistake shape-wise, and first of all, 'a sword that won't break' is like a name, right? There's no such thing as a sword that won't break.[lr]::
40495::$$$message_0350_0011_0002$$$::But Shirou. What you imagined was 'a sword that never breaks,' right? If this sword breaks in real life, then what you Projected becomes a lie."::
40496::$$$message_0350_0012_0000$$$::"That is not because the sword broke.[lr]::
40497::$$$message_0350_0012_0001$$$::What you imagined is 'a sword that won't break.'[lr]::
40498::$$$message_0350_0012_0002$$$::At the point that it broke, 'a sword that won't break' and 'the sword that just broke right now' are two different things.[lr]::
40499::$$$message_0350_0012_0003$$$::   It's because the scale between you and reality tips."::
40500::$$$message_0350_0013_0000$$$::...?[lr]::
40501::$$$message_0350_0013_0001$$$::Umm, so to sum it up...::
40502::$$$message_0350_0014_0000$$$::"...All right.[lr]::
40503::$$$message_0350_0014_0001$$$::So, I imagined a sword that won't break and Projected it. But, the sword that I Projected broke during battle.[lr]::
40504::$$$message_0350_0014_0002$$$::At that point, since I denied the sword myself saying, 'hey, this sword breaks in real life,' the Projected thing disappeared as a result.[lr]::
40505::$$$message_0350_0014_0003$$$::Because of the image's discrepancy."::
40506::$$$message_0350_0015_0000$$$::"You're pretty bright. Yes, you're right.[lr]::
40507::$$$message_0350_0015_0001$$$::You Projected Archer's swords.[lr]::
40508::$$$message_0350_0015_0002$$$::I don't know how you ranked Archer's swords, but you yourself didn't imagine a sword that would get destroyed by Kuzuki's attacks."::
40509::$$$message_0350_0016_0000$$$::"But the sword got destroyed in reality.[lr]::
40510::$$$message_0350_0016_0001$$$::At that point, you thought 'these aren't Archer's swords.'[lr]::
40511::$$$message_0350_0016_0002$$$::So, the Projection was denied by the creator, so it lost the strength of its existence and became a fantasy again."::
40512::$$$message_0350_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40513::$$$message_0350_0017_0001$$$::...I see.[lr]::
40514::$$$message_0350_0017_0002$$$::Even Projected weapons can break.[lr]::
40515::$$$message_0350_0017_0003$$$::But, it's not the enemy that makes the Projected weapon disappear, but yourself.[lr]::
40516::$$$message_0350_0017_0004$$$::When the difference between your image and reality becomes too big to amend, the Projected weapon disappears.[lr]::
40517::$$$message_0350_0017_0005$$$::Most of all, it is because the one who created it stopped believing in that illusion.::
40518::$$$message_0350_0018_0000$$$::"Got it? That's why Projection magecraft starts from the blueprint. You should also consider the materials, properties, and history. If you have those down, then it shouldn't disappear right away even if reality is slightly different from your image."::
40519::$$$message_0350_0019_0000$$$::"Huh? Then, wouldn't you start from considering why you decided to make that in the first place?[lr]::
40520::$$$message_0350_0019_0001$$$::Materials and techniques aren't enough.[lr]::
40521::$$$message_0350_0019_0002$$$::Today's dinner also started from you saying that you wanted to eat Japanese cuisine. Then, you have to start from the beginning of the creation."::
40522::$$$message_0350_0020_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40523::$$$message_0350_0020_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Oh.[font italic=false][lr]::
40524::$$$message_0350_0020_0002$$$::Tohsaka is stunned.::
40525::$$$message_0350_0021_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
40526::$$$message_0350_0021_0001$$$::Tohsaka stares me.[lr]::
40527::$$$message_0350_0021_0002$$$::I sip my tea and tilt my head in wonder.::
40528::$$$message_0350_0022_0000$$$::"Hey. Why did we start talking about this again?"[lr]::
40529::$$$message_0350_0022_0001$$$::"...Come to think of it. I thought we were discussing our strategy moving forward..."::
40530::$$$message_0350_0023_0000$$$::Yeah, that's right.[lr]::
40531::$$$message_0350_0023_0001$$$::As we were talking about what we should do moving forward, Tohsaka...[lr]::
40532::$$$message_0350_0023_0002$$$::"Shirou, do you want to try Projection magecraft fully fledged?"[lr]::
40533::$$$message_0350_0023_0003$$$::...said an irresponsible thing like that.::
40534::$$$message_0350_0024_0000$$$::"...I remember now. We were so stuck that we started placing hope on uncertain factors."[lr]::
40535::$$$message_0350_0024_0001$$$::"...Yeah, you're right.[lr]::
40536::$$$message_0350_0024_0002$$$::First off, all I can manage to Project is swords. And that's never helped me before, so that probably won't be of much help."::
40537::$$$message_0350_0025_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
40538::$$$message_0350_0025_0001$$$::Oh, she's looking at me with weird eyes again.[lr]::
40539::$$$message_0350_0025_0002$$$::...I wonder why she makes that expression when we talk about Projection magecraft.::
40540::$$$message_0350_0026_0000$$$::"...Oh well. Let's confirm our situation again.[lr]::
40541::$$$message_0350_0026_0001$$$::For now, the enemy is Caster. It's not a big deal if it's just her, but we can't do anything as long as she's protected by Kuzuki, who's skilled in close combat, and Archer, who went to the other side.[lr]::
40542::$$$message_0350_0026_0002$$$::On top of that, it's only a matter of time until Saber will be manipulated. The situation is getting worse by the second..."::
40543::$$$message_0350_0027_0000$$$::"...Yeah. But, Archer aside, Saber isn't fully under Caster's control yet.[lr]::
40544::$$$message_0350_0027_0001$$$::That gives us a chance of victory.[lr]::
40545::$$$message_0350_0027_0002$$$::There's no chance to win once Saber completely submits to Caster."::
40546::$$$message_0350_0028_0000$$$::Besides, I won't let that happen.[lr]::
40547::$$$message_0350_0028_0001$$$::...She told me to run.[lr]::
40548::$$$message_0350_0028_0002$$$::For the sake of Saber who said that while crying, I can't let Caster have her way.::
40549::$$$message_0350_0029_0000$$$::"...That's right.[lr]::
40550::$$$message_0350_0029_0001$$$::Raise your hand if you have an idea. Shirou, do you have any good ideas?"::
40551::$$$message_0350_0030_0000$$$::"Hm..."[lr]::
40552::$$$message_0350_0030_0001$$$::A plan that will be a solution to the current situation.[lr]::
40553::$$$message_0350_0030_0002$$$::If there's a way to oppose Caster, it's...[lr]Mhæ¥
