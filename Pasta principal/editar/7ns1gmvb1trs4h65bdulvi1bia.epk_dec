68546::$$$message_0630_0000_0000$$$::We reach the forest's exit sooner than I imagined.[lr]::
68547::$$$message_0630_0000_0001$$$::It's probably because Illya showed me the way. She owns these woods.[lr]::
68548::$$$message_0630_0000_0002$$$::When we go out to the highway, the car I arrived in is gone.[lr]::
68549::$$$message_0630_0000_0003$$$::We start walking in the direction of the town, and decide to flag down a passing vehicle to take us the rest of the way.::
68550::$$$message_0630_0001_0000$$$::Wounded and covered in mud, Illya and I must look suspicious.[lr]::
68551::$$$message_0630_0001_0001$$$::We run in front of a passing car to get it to stop, and then Illya hypnotizes the surprised driver into taking us home.[lr]::
68552::$$$message_0630_0001_0002$$$::Wow.[lr]::
68553::$$$message_0630_0001_0003$$$::I never thought in my life that I'd hitchhike like a car hijacker.::
68554::$$$message_0630_0002_0000$$$::"Shirou, we're home. Let's go."[lr]::
68555::$$$message_0630_0002_0001$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
68556::$$$message_0630_0002_0002$$$::We got home before I knew it.[lr]::
68557::$$$message_0630_0002_0003$$$::The sun is going down.[lr]::
68558::$$$message_0630_0002_0004$$$::At some point during the several hours it took to return from the forest, I must have dozed off.::
68559::$$$message_0630_0003_0000$$$::The sun has set by the time I'm back in the living room.[lr]::
68560::$$$message_0630_0003_0001$$$::The clock reads past 7:00 PM.::
68561::$$$message_0630_0004_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
68562::$$$message_0630_0004_0001$$$::Something's wrong.[lr]::
68563::$$$message_0630_0004_0002$$$::Time is passing too quickly.[lr]::
68564::$$$message_0630_0004_0003$$$::It was barely sunset when I got into the house, but the moment I enter the living room, night has fallen. That's impossible.::
68565::$$$message_0630_0005_0000$$$::"Illya. Isn't time passing too quickly?"[lr]::
68566::$$$message_0630_0005_0001$$$::I talk to Illya next to me.::
68567::$$$message_0630_0006_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68568::$$$message_0630_0006_0001$$$::But Illya isn't next to me.[lr]::
68569::$$$message_0630_0006_0002$$$::Illya is...[lr]::
68570::$$$message_0630_0006_0003$$$::"Hm? Dinner was delicious, Shirou."[lr]::
68571::$$$message_0630_0006_0004$$$::She's already in the living room, saying something odd.::
68572::$$$message_0630_0007_0000$$$::"...Dinner?"[lr]::
68573::$$$message_0630_0007_0001$$$::"Yeah. I was surprised when you said that we need nutrition first, but it was a good idea. You worked hard in the kitchen."::
68574::$$$message_0630_0008_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68575::$$$message_0630_0008_0001$$$::There are remains of a meal on the dining table.[lr]::
68576::$$$message_0630_0008_0002$$$::Enough used dishes for two.[lr]::
68577::$$$message_0630_0008_0003$$$::I calmly think it through and realize that I feel full.[lr]::
68578::$$$message_0630_0008_0004$$$::It seems like I really did cook dinner.::
68579::$$$message_0630_0009_0000$$$::"...That's odd. Did I buy groceries ahead of time?"[lr]::
68580::$$$message_0630_0009_0001$$$::"No, you didn't. That's why you went down to the store and brought a lot back, remember?"::
68581::$$$message_0630_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68582::$$$message_0630_0010_0001$$$::Hm. I search my memory.[lr]::
68583::$$$message_0630_0010_0002$$$::...[lr]::
68584::$$$message_0630_0010_0003$$$::......[lr]::
68585::$$$message_0630_0010_0004$$$::.........[lr]::
68586::$$$message_0630_0010_0005$$$::............Oh, well.[lr]::
68587::$$$message_0630_0010_0006$$$::Maybe that did happen.::
68588::$$$message_0630_0011_0000$$$::"Oh, right. Not sure why I said that. Anyway, dinner's over."[lr]::
68589::$$$message_0630_0011_0001$$$::"Yeah. You just need to rest now, Shirou."::
68590::$$$message_0630_0012_0000$$$::"Mm. Yeah, I should get some rest. I'm going to go change in my room. I want to talk to you about something, so wait here a little longer. I'll be right back."[lr]::
68591::$$$message_0630_0012_0001$$$::Illya nods.[lr]::
68592::$$$message_0630_0012_0002$$$::I apologize and leave the living room.::
68593::$$$message_0630_0013_0000$$$::I find myself in my bedroom.[lr]::
68594::$$$message_0630_0013_0001$$$::The second I left the living room, I collapsed in my room.::
68595::$$$message_0630_0014_0000$$$::"Zzhh...grrgh...!"[lr]::
68596::$$$message_0630_0014_0001$$$::I'm awoken by stabbing pain.[lr]::
68597::$$$message_0630_0014_0002$$$::A sword is stabbing the left side of my chest.[lr]::
68598::$$$message_0630_0014_0003$$$::That's the only way I can describe it. My chest is hot, and numb. It feels like my life force is gushing out instead of blood.::
68599::$$$message_0630_0015_0000$$$::"Guh..."[lr]::
68600::$$$message_0630_0015_0001$$$::Of course, I'm not literally being stabbed.[lr]::
68601::$$$message_0630_0015_0002$$$::That's just a hallucination.[lr]::
68602::$$$message_0630_0015_0003$$$::The part of my body that's closest to my left arm is rejecting the sense of wrongness coming from it.[lr]::
68603::$$$message_0630_0015_0004$$$::And that's when I realize it.[lr]::
68604::$$$message_0630_0015_0005$$$::The way time seems to pass too quickly...[lr]::
68605::$$$message_0630_0015_0006$$$::The disjointed images. They're all...::
68606::$$$message_0630_0016_0000$$$::"...Oh. It's not my sense of time that's weird."[lr]::
68607::$$$message_0630_0016_0001$$$::There's just something wrong with my memory.[lr]::
68608::$$$message_0630_0016_0002$$$::I'm not missing memories of my past, but I'm not making new records of my experiences.::
68609::$$$message_0630_0017_0000$$$::Bit by bit, when I let time pass without focusing, I don't remember anything that happens during that time.[lr]::
68610::$$$message_0630_0017_0001$$$::No wonder I can't remember anything that happened since leaving the forest.[lr]::
68611::$$$message_0630_0017_0002$$$::If not for this pain, I'd have lost my mind by now.::
68612::$$$message_0630_0018_0000$$$::"That's...bad."[lr]::
68613::$$$message_0630_0018_0001$$$::I grab hold of my consciousness that seems to cut off whenever I relax.[lr]::
68614::$$$message_0630_0018_0002$$$::Unless I stay aware of myself and keep my mind in tight focus, Shirou Emiya will disappear.[lr]::
68615::$$$message_0630_0018_0003$$$::My memories and my self won't hold together unless I keep my focus as keen as the pain stabbing me in the chest.[lr]::
68616::$$$message_0630_0018_0004$$$::In other words, I need to maintain the same level of concentration that I did when I tried to insert Magic Circuits into my spine, at all times?::
68617::$$$message_0630_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68618::$$$message_0630_0019_0001$$$::...Uh oh.[lr]::
68619::$$$message_0630_0019_0002$$$::I can't keep that up, and even if I could, I don't know how long it will keep working.::
68620::$$$message_0630_0020_0000$$$::"...Wait. How am I supposed to sleep, then?"[lr]::
68621::$$$message_0630_0020_0001$$$::I'll never wake up if I sleep.[lr]::
68622::$$$message_0630_0020_0002$$$::If I fall asleep, I won't go back to being Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
68623::$$$message_0630_0020_0003$$$::My mind will be torn to pieces without a single wound on my physical body.::
68624::$$$message_0630_0021_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
68625::$$$message_0630_0021_0001$$$::I rise.[lr]::
68626::$$$message_0630_0021_0002$$$::I rummage through my desk. I need some kind of small blade. Something I can hide in my right hand and squeeze hard to cut myself.[lr]::
68627::$$$message_0630_0021_0003$$$::I can't constantly maintain a state of concentration like when I'm training.[lr]::
68628::$$$message_0630_0021_0004$$$::When it feels like the images are about to cut out, I'll make a fist and use the pain to ground myself.::
68629::$$$message_0630_0022_0000$$$::"...Oh. I don't have a blade, but this..."[lr]::
68630::$$$message_0630_0022_0001$$$::I find the crystal I got a while ago in my desk.[lr]::
68631::$$$message_0630_0022_0002$$$::The night I became a Master, I found this pendant lying next to me after Lancer killed me.[lr]::
68632::$$$message_0630_0022_0003$$$::I don't know how much magical energy it used to contain, but it doesn't have enough left to use my Strengthening even once.::
68633::$$$message_0630_0023_0000$$$::...Yeah. I could try and figure out who saved my life that night. They must be the owner of his pendant.[lr]::
68634::$$$message_0630_0023_0001$$$::We were the only ones on campus that night. I don't know why they saved me, but it was someone who didn't need a reason to help a dying person.::
68635::$$$message_0630_0024_0000$$$::"Ah..."[lr]::
68636::$$$message_0630_0024_0001$$$::My consciousness is cutting out.[lr]::
68637::$$$message_0630_0024_0002$$$::I'll figure this out later.[lr]::
68638::$$$message_0630_0024_0003$$$::If I think of fun or happy things, I'll relax and pass out.::
68639::$$$message_0630_0025_0000$$$::   I confirm my fighting strength.[lr]::
68640::$$$message_0630_0025_0001$$$::I've broken the seal on my left arm.[lr]::
68641::$$$message_0630_0025_0002$$$::The holy shroud is still wrapped around it, but all it does is take the edge off now.[lr]::
68642::$$$message_0630_0025_0003$$$::Kotomine told me that using Archer's arm would flip a switch.[lr]::
68643::$$$message_0630_0025_0004$$$::It's too late to do anything about it now.::
68644::$$$message_0630_0026_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68645::$$$message_0630_0026_0001$$$::My body is still functional.[lr]::
68646::$$$message_0630_0026_0002$$$::The problem is with my brain. I can keep going as long as I don't sleep.[lr]::
68647::$$$message_0630_0026_0003$$$::As for Projection... I can probably use Archer's "Blade Works" no more than three times.::
68648::$$$message_0630_0027_0000$$$::If it's just once, I can deal with it.[lr]::
68649::$$$message_0630_0027_0001$$$::Twice scares me a little, to be honest.[lr]::
68650::$$$message_0630_0027_0002$$$::And the third Projection will be decisive. My mind might remain, but I have a feeling my body will self-destruct.::
68651::$$$message_0630_0028_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
68652::$$$message_0630_0028_0001$$$::I close my eyes and focus on my ears.[lr]::
68653::$$$message_0630_0028_0002$$$::...I hear a hard, grinding noise next to my heartbeat.::
68654::$$$message_0630_0029_0000$$$::...Something is invading my body from Archer's left arm.[lr]::
68655::$$$message_0630_0029_0001$$$::Each time I use Blade Works, I lose control of his Reality Marble and create Unlimited Blade Works inside my body, instead of outside of it.[lr]::
68656::$$$message_0630_0029_0002$$$::...I don't want to think about the consequences of that.[lr]::
68657::$$$message_0630_0029_0003$$$::I'm going to get stabbed from the inside by a thousand swords and die.::
68658::$$$message_0630_0030_0000$$$::"...Just kidding. I'm not going kill myself."[lr]::
68659::$$$message_0630_0030_0001$$$::The situation is desperate.[lr]::
68660::$$$message_0630_0030_0002$$$::I've more or less accepted that.[lr]::
68661::$$$message_0630_0030_0003$$$::I just need to break out of these straits.[lr]::
68662::$$$message_0630_0030_0004$$$::I won't die, and I won't kill myself.[lr]::
68663::$$$message_0630_0030_0005$$$::Sleeping and never waking up? That's just a cowardly delusion.::
68664::$$$message_0630_0031_0000$$$::   I'll be saved.[lr]::
68665::$$$message_0630_0031_0001$$$::Once I do what I need to do and end all of this, I'll be saved.[lr]::
68666::$$$message_0630_0031_0002$$$::There's no point to it otherwise.[lr]::
68667::$$$message_0630_0031_0003$$$::I said that I'd protect Sakura, no matter what.[lr]::
68668::$$$message_0630_0031_0004$$$::So I can't go dying on my own.::
68669::$$$message_0630_0032_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I should contact Tohsaka first."[lr]::
68670::$$$message_0630_0032_0001$$$::There's no time.[lr]::
68671::$$$message_0630_0032_0002$$$::I've gotta hurry over to Tohsaka's house.[lr]::
68672::$$$message_0630_0032_0003$$$::I wonder if Kotomine's safe, but now that I've rescued Illya, he'll probably go back to his usual stance.[lr]::
68673::$$$message_0630_0032_0004$$$::I don't want his help, but I promised[line2]::
68674::$$$message_0630_0033_0000$$$::It's past nine o'clock.[lr]::
68675::$$$message_0630_0033_0001$$$::I meant to be right back, but it's been two hours.::
68676::$$$message_0630_0034_0000$$$::"...Sorry for making you wait, Illya. I want to go to Tohsaka's house. Let's go together."[lr]::
68677::$$$message_0630_0034_0001$$$::"Rin's house? Mm, I don't mind, but why?"::
68678::$$$message_0630_0035_0000$$$::"Huh? Well, we need to regroup with her. I want to know how she's doing, too.[lr]::
68679::$$$message_0630_0035_0001$$$::Kotomine said that she'd recover by tonight, but I can't trust what he says. If she's in trouble, we need to help her."::
68680::$$$message_0630_0036_0000$$$::"Hmm. That's fine, but Shirou..."[lr]::
68681::$$$message_0630_0036_0001$$$::Illya points at the wall.[lr]::
68682::$$$message_0630_0036_0002$$$::    Oh.::
68683::$$$message_0630_0037_0000$$$::"I'm happy you care. I'm fine, as you can see.[lr]::
68684::$$$message_0630_0037_0001$$$::But if you were that worried about me, I wish you would've stopped by my house after you left the forest."::
68685::$$$message_0630_0038_0000$$$::"T-Tohsaka...!? When did you get here...?"::
68686::$$$message_0630_0039_0000$$$::"Just an hour ago. Illya told me what happened in the forest."::
68687::$$$message_0630_0040_0000$$$::Tohsaka's in a bad mood...no, she's positively furious.[lr]::
68688::$$$message_0630_0040_0001$$$::She must be upset that we went to the forest without her.::
68689::$$$message_0630_0041_0000$$$::"I didn't have much choice. I thought it was a race against time, and Illya was in actual danger.[lr]::
68690::$$$message_0630_0041_0001$$$::Right, Illya?"::
68691::$$$message_0630_0042_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I wasn't locked up, but they might have taken me to the Greater Grail and ripped out my heart if you'd come a few minutes later.[lr]::
68692::$$$message_0630_0042_0001$$$::If Zouken manages to take over Sakura, he'll use me to open the gate. If you and Kotomine had come a little later, I'd be dead already."::
68693::$$$message_0630_0043_0000$$$::"See? I wouldn't have made it in time if I waited for you."[lr]::
68694::$$$message_0630_0043_0001$$$::"Oh, really? Those excuses all depend on Sakura. How about the truth, Illya?"::
68695::$$$message_0630_0044_0000$$$::"Oh, could you tell?[lr]::
68696::$$$message_0630_0044_0001$$$::Yeah, I think I still had a bit more time. Sakura is strong-willed, so she won't break that easily. I would have given it one more day until she lost her mind and became Zouken's puppet."::
68697::$$$message_0630_0045_0000$$$::"I knew it. Illya, you shouldn't spoil Shirou so much, you know. You just need to be twice as strict on him as you are to other people."[lr]::
68698::$$$message_0630_0045_0001$$$::"Yeah. I'm glad that you're here to do that for him."::
68699::$$$message_0630_0046_0000$$$::I watch them rake me over the coals.[lr]::
68700::$$$message_0630_0046_0001$$$::But even if there was an extra day's worth of time left, I'm still not sure I could have made it in time with Tohsaka, even if we went right now.[lr]::
68701::$$$message_0630_0046_0002$$$::I was faced with a tough choice in the forest, but thanks to that, all three of us are here again.::
68702::$$$message_0630_0047_0000$$$::"Ngh."[lr]::
68703::$$$message_0630_0047_0001$$$::...I tightly squeeze my wandering mind.[lr]::
68704::$$$message_0630_0047_0002$$$::Tohsaka and Illya's banter threatened to relax my tension.::
68705::$$$message_0630_0048_0000$$$::"...Hm? Hold on, Illya.[lr]::
68706::$$$message_0630_0048_0001$$$::If you weren't sure whether Sakura would hold on for another day, then you would have had..."::
68707::$$$message_0630_0049_0000$$$::"Half a day or so... No. No matter how hard Sakura tries, she's about to give birth to Avenger. She'll completely change once she conceives it. Nobody will be able to save Sakura then, and nobody will be saved, either."::
68708::$$$message_0630_0050_0000$$$::"Avenger?"[lr]::
68709::$$$message_0630_0050_0001$$$::Tohsaka and I frown at the unfamiliar word.::
68710::$$$message_0630_0051_0000$$$::"Yeah, a literal avenger.[lr]::
68711::$$$message_0630_0051_0001$$$::It's the eighth class of the Holy Grail War that the Einzberns summoned when they broke the rules.[lr]::
68712::$$$message_0630_0051_0002$$$::Its curse is what contaminated the inside of the Holy Grail.[lr]::
68713::$$$message_0630_0051_0003$$$::It can't get out on its own, so it merged with Sakura to project that Shadow.[lr]::
68714::$$$message_0630_0051_0004$$$::And, it's an impossible existence that's still eating people to try and gain a definite form."::
68715::$$$message_0630_0052_0000$$$::"That's Avenger[line2]an Anti-Hero who must never be summoned, and who was called forth by the Einzbern Master during the third ritual."::
68716::$$$message_0630_0053_0000$$$::"You knew, Illya!? You knew what the Shadow was, and what was trying to possess Sakura!?"[lr]::
68717::$$$message_0630_0053_0001$$$::"Yes. I understood what was happening when I extracted necessary information from Sakura.[lr]::
68718::$$$message_0630_0053_0002$$$::What I need to do, and what you and Shirou call your enemy."::
68719::$$$message_0630_0054_0000$$$::Illya closes her eyes once.[lr]::
68720::$$$message_0630_0054_0001$$$::...In resignation, I think.[lr]::
68721::$$$message_0630_0054_0002$$$::She sighs, and seems to make up her mind about something.::

68723::$$$message_0630_0055_0001$$$::As the final Masters in this Holy Grail War, I'll let you hear the facts."::
68724::$$$message_0630_0056_0000$$$::"Illya?"[lr]::
68725::$$$message_0630_0056_0001$$$::Tohsaka looks at her in amazement.[lr]::
68726::$$$message_0630_0056_0002$$$::So do I.[lr]::
68727::$$$message_0630_0056_0003$$$::Right now, Illya's displaying a hollow calm that makes her seem like a different person.::
68728::$$$message_0630_0057_0000$$$::"It all began two hundred years ago.[lr]::
68729::$$$message_0630_0057_0001$$$::No, their journey in search of the Holy Grail had been going on for some time before that, but the ritual was established in this land two hundred years ago."::
68730::$$$message_0630_0058_0000$$$::"That's where our story begins.[lr]::
68731::$$$message_0630_0058_0001$$$::The Holy Grail is a device that can grant any wish. To complete it, the Einzberns, Makiris, and Tohsakas cooperated in a ritual to summon the Holy Grail.[lr]::
68732::$$$message_0630_0058_0002$$$::That was the start of the Holy Grail War. A deathmatch to determine ownership of the Holy Grail, wherein seven Heroic Spirits are summoned.[lr]::
68733::$$$message_0630_0058_0003$$$::The Masters chosen by the Holy Grail become hosts for Heroic Spirits and kill each other until only one survives.[lr]::
68734::$$$message_0630_0058_0004$$$::That's the pretext for what you two know as the Holy Grail War."::
68735::$$$message_0630_0059_0000$$$::"You don't look surprised, Rin. Did you start to suspect something?"::
68736::$$$message_0630_0060_0000$$$::"...More or less. I realized right away that someone was taking advantage of it, but I didn't give it too much thought.[lr]::
68737::$$$message_0630_0060_0001$$$::We use a system that someone else created and reap the benefits. It's only fair that's using us as much as we use it.[lr]::
68738::$$$message_0630_0060_0002$$$::I'm not dumb enough to split hairs over every single flaw, though."::
68739::$$$message_0630_0061_0000$$$::"I see. Then I don't need to explain that the reality is the other way around, right? What about you, Shirou? Did you notice that the entire premise of having Servants fight each other is unnecessary?"::
68740::$$$message_0630_0062_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68741::$$$message_0630_0062_0001$$$::...I guess I did, now that I think about it.::
68742::$$$message_0630_0063_0000$$$::Servants are summoned by the Holy Grail.[lr]::
68743::$$$message_0630_0063_0001$$$::Heroic Spirits are summoned as tools to test the worthiness of those chosen by the Holy Grail.[lr]::
68744::$$$message_0630_0063_0002$$$::To obtain the Holy Grail, the summoned Heroic Spirits make contracts with hosts[line2]Masters who will anchor them to the mortal world, and fight to defeat all of the other grail-seekers.::
68745::$$$message_0630_0064_0000$$$::...If that's all it was, then I might have looked past it.[lr]::
68746::$$$message_0630_0064_0001$$$::But when I learned that defeated Heroic Spirits are absorbed into the Holy Grail instead of disappearing, I started to have questions.[lr]::
68747::$$$message_0630_0064_0002$$$::Heroic Spirits[line2]Servants[line2]are components used to select the worthiest Master for the Holy Grail.[lr]::
68748::$$$message_0630_0064_0003$$$::So why are they stored in the Holy Grail once they've served their purpose?::
68749::$$$message_0630_0065_0000$$$::"...You're saying that the Holy Grail War only needs the Heroic Spirits, and that the Masters are tools to summon them...?"::
68750::$$$message_0630_0066_0000$$$::"Yeah. In the Holy Grail War ritual, Masters are nothing but receptors for the Servants. As long as they can summon the Servants, it doesn't matter if they all die afterward.[lr]::
68751::$$$message_0630_0066_0001$$$::Only the Heroic Spirits are needed to complete the Holy Grail.[lr]::
68752::$$$message_0630_0066_0002$$$::They are pure souls which exist outside the time axis, separate from the world's laws, yet have power from outside the world which allows them to interfere with our world. That is the true essence of Heroic Spirits."::
68753::$$$message_0630_0067_0000$$$::"The founders needed that power.[lr]::
68754::$$$message_0630_0067_0001$$$::They tried to use it to go outside the world.[lr]::
68755::$$$message_0630_0067_0002$$$::And that's the true objective of the Holy Grail built on this land.[lr]::
68756::$$$message_0630_0067_0003$$$::The Holy Grail Wars that have been taking place here are meant to achieve a miracle beyond human power, to attain an inhuman phenomenon."::
68757::$$$message_0630_0068_0000$$$::"It's a Mystic believed lost to us Einzberns. A grand ritual to achieve true immortality.[lr]::
68758::$$$message_0630_0068_0001$$$::A godly feat that can materialize the souls that depart when the body dies, not as Heroic or Divine Spirits, but as humble humans."::

68763::$$$message_0630_0070_0002$$$::We're stunned.[lr]::
68764::$$$message_0630_0070_0003$$$::Illya said that the Holy Grail is a ritual to operate Magic.::
68765::$$$message_0630_0071_0000$$$::[font italic=true]Magic.[font italic=false][lr]::
68766::$$$message_0630_0071_0001$$$::Mystics that magecraft can't achieve. Phenomena that current humans can't realize through any means.[lr]::
68767::$$$message_0630_0071_0002$$$::It's said to be the final objective of mages, and they call those who master it Magicians, with envy and awe.::
68768::$$$message_0630_0072_0000$$$::Currently, the Mage's Association recognizes five Magics.[lr]::
68769::$$$message_0630_0072_0001$$$::An outsider like me[line2]on the edges of the edge, no, who isn't even affiliated with the Association[line2]couldn't possibly know what the details are, but I've heard that there are five rituals that are recognized as Magic, and that there are only four people who can use them.::
68770::$$$message_0630_0073_0000$$$::"H-hold on! The Third Magic is the materialization of the soul!? But Servants are already materialized souls...!"::
68771::$$$message_0630_0074_0000$$$::"They aren't. It's true that the foundation of Heroic Spirit summoning uses a portion of the Third Magic, but Heroic Spirits are ultimately evocations.[lr]::
68772::$$$message_0630_0074_0001$$$::Servants don't live in this land, this time period. They're incomplete manifestations of the Third Magic, and Heroic Spirits can use hosts to materialize without using the Third Magic."::

68774::$$$message_0630_0075_0001$$$::It creates higher-dimensional beings which can exist independently and interact with the material world, while still being cognitive bodies.[lr]::
68775::$$$message_0630_0075_0002$$$::I'm talking about turning souls themselves into living beings and advancing them to the next stage of life."::
68776::$$$message_0630_0076_0000$$$::"T-the next stage? That does sound...incredible, but...[lr]::
68777::$$$message_0630_0076_0001$$$::Illya, even if they all do different things, the Magics are supposed to be a path to the Root, aren't they!? What does this have to do with the Holy Grail?"::
68778::$$$message_0630_0077_0000$$$::"To begin with, there's only one territory in Japan that can activate Magic.[lr]::
68779::$$$message_0630_0077_0001$$$::Fuyuki boasts first-rate leylines, but it lacks any quirks that would let it connect to the Root."::
68780::$$$message_0630_0078_0000$$$::"Yes. This place isn't distorted enough to reach it. So a hole is opened instead. If there's no road connecting to the Root, then you just need to break the walls down, right?"::
68781::$$$message_0630_0079_0000$$$::"And the Holy Grail War is the act of breaking that wall.[lr]::
68782::$$$message_0630_0079_0001$$$::Collecting enough magical energy to grant any wish is part of that process, but the Einzberns only view it as a secondary benefit. In fact, it's just advertising to lure in Masters to serve as sacrifices for the ritual."::
68783::$$$message_0630_0080_0000$$$::"All the Einzberns needed was a giant magic circle that could store a large amount of magical energy away from the prying eyes of the Mage's Association.[lr]::
68784::$$$message_0630_0080_0001$$$::The Tohsaka patriarch at the time helped them.[lr]::
68785::$$$message_0630_0080_0002$$$::This has always been a land where the Association's reach is limited, and there aren't many places comparable to the Aozakis' land.[lr]::
68786::$$$message_0630_0080_0003$$$::To the Einzberns, Fuyuki was a nearly perfect testing ground with all the conditions they needed."::
68787::$$$message_0630_0081_0000$$$::"You know the rest.[lr]::
68788::$$$message_0630_0081_0001$$$::There are two Holy Grails.[lr]::
68789::$$$message_0630_0081_0002$$$::The Holy Grail sleeping in the earth, and the Holy Grail which the Einzberns prepare.[lr]::
68790::$$$message_0630_0081_0003$$$::The former is a magic circle that uses the Tohsakas' land.[lr]::
68791::$$$message_0630_0081_0004$$$::We call it the Greater Grail,[lr]::
68792::$$$message_0630_0081_0005$$$::while the key that the Einzberns supply each time is the Lesser Grail."::
68793::$$$message_0630_0082_0000$$$::"The Greater Grail manages the Holy Grail War system, while the Lesser Grail collects the souls of defeated Heroic Spirits and serves as a core to power the Greater Grail."::
68794::$$$message_0630_0083_0000$$$::"Once enough souls are saved up to activate the Greater Grail, it uses the souls of the visitors from the outside, Heroic Spirits, to open the hole.[lr]::
68795::$$$message_0630_0083_0001$$$::Once their role is complete and they return to the Throne they came from, the small opening is stabilized by the Greater Grail's power, and a path to the Root, which can't be reached by humans, opens."::
68796::$$$message_0630_0084_0000$$$::"Of course, that's just the first step. They can't obtain what they want just because they made an opening. The path to the Root is too long."::
68797::$$$message_0630_0085_0000$$$::"Still, those who obtain the Holy Grail gain access to an unlimited source of magical energy.[lr]::
68798::$$$message_0630_0085_0001$$$::Nobody's used it yet, because this land is still suffused in an incomparable amount of mana. To a normal mage, that reward is more than enough to call a miracle."::
68799::$$$message_0630_0086_0000$$$::"...Okay. So there's a big magic circle called the Greater Grail, and the Lesser Grail is its activation key.[lr]::
68800::$$$message_0630_0086_0001$$$::The reason the Holy Grail War takes place every fifty years is to save up enough mana to summon Heroic Spirits."::
68801::$$$message_0630_0087_0000$$$::"An individual doesn't have enough magical energy to pull off a summoning like that.[lr]::
68802::$$$message_0630_0087_0001$$$::The Greater Grail takes fifty years to collect this land's mana without sucking it dry, and once it has enough..."::
68803::$$$message_0630_0088_0000$$$::"It summons Heroic Spirits and molds them into Servants.[lr]::
68804::$$$message_0630_0088_0001$$$::But the summoning comes at a price. They wouldn't respond to the call unless they had something to gain.[lr]::
68805::$$$message_0630_0088_0002$$$::So, the Lesser Grail was created as an offering to them."::
68806::$$$message_0630_0089_0000$$$::"...Of course, it was always a lie.[lr]::
68807::$$$message_0630_0089_0001$$$::The Einzberns have only ever wanted the Heroic Spirits' souls.[lr]::
68808::$$$message_0630_0089_0002$$$::They didn't care about the spiritual cores. They just wanted massive souls.[lr]::
68809::$$$message_0630_0089_0003$$$::So, they came up with the Holy Grail War scheme to trick Servants and Masters into killing each other. It is a scheme that continues to this day."::
68810::$$$message_0630_0090_0000$$$::"...That only started from the second war, though.[lr]::
68811::$$$message_0630_0090_0001$$$::I was taught that during the first war, they wantonly summoned Heroic Spirits, and Tohsaka, Makiri, and Einzbern all fought over control of them, until it all ended in sudden failure."::
68812::$$$message_0630_0091_0000$$$::"That's why they came up with the current rules, which were applied starting from the second war.[lr]::
68813::$$$message_0630_0091_0001$$$::They invited mages from afar, and they all killed each other for the Holy Grail.[lr]::
68814::$$$message_0630_0091_0002$$$::As long as they had their own Servants, the other Masters were just obstacles, and it was efficient to have them die in battle.[lr]::
68815::$$$message_0630_0091_0003$$$::From the perspective of the founding families, it was a legal and convenient way to eliminate the other collaborators."::
68816::$$$message_0630_0092_0000$$$::"My god. So, what, the rule about Masters fighting each other was invented because they couldn't peacefully negotiate ownership rights and tried to seize it by force?"::
68817::$$$message_0630_0093_0000$$$::"That's right. But the deathmatch turned out to be an effective way to select the winners.[lr]::
68818::$$$message_0630_0093_0001$$$::It's like you, Rin. Some Servants and Masters might have realized they were being lied to, but they still didn't care. After all, they would still obtain the Holy Grail if they won."::
68819::$$$message_0630_0094_0000$$$::Tohsaka seems to accept that.[lr]::
68820::$$$message_0630_0094_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
68821::$$$message_0630_0094_0002$$$::...In other words, the Holy Grail War ritual wasn't meant to obtain the Holy Grail, but to use it to go outside of the world.::
68822::$$$message_0630_0095_0000$$$::It was an attempt to go outside.[lr]::
68823::$$$message_0630_0095_0001$$$::According to studies of the arcane, a power said to be the pinnacle of dimensional theory is located outside of this world.[lr]::
68824::$$$message_0630_0095_0002$$$::It's called the "Swirl of the Root," and its coordinates are believed to be the origin of all things.[lr]::
68825::$$$message_0630_0095_0003$$$::It's said to be the seat of the gods[line2]the alpha and omega of creation, where everything in the world is recorded, and everything in the world can be made.::
68826::$$$message_0630_0096_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
68827::$$$message_0630_0096_0001$$$::But who cares about all of that, honestly?[lr]::
68828::$$$message_0630_0096_0002$$$::My old man might have understood how important it was, but it has absolutely nothing to do with me.[lr]::
68829::$$$message_0630_0096_0003$$$::What's important is how it concerns the identity of the thing possessing Sakura.::
68830::$$$message_0630_0097_0000$$$::"Illya. I don't care about the true goal of the Holy Grail War. You said yourself that it isn't relevant to us.[lr]::
68831::$$$message_0630_0097_0001$$$::More importantly, tell us about the thing you mentioned earlier."::
68832::$$$message_0630_0098_0000$$$::"I-irrelevant!? This is Magic we're talking about! The Third Magic, no less! It's a taboo of taboos which the Association has kept under wraps forever![lr]::
68833::$$$message_0630_0098_0001$$$::You're a mage, too, so you can't just ignore the Third[line2]"::
68834::$$$message_0630_0099_0000$$$::"Yes, I can... Come on, Tohsaka, what are you thinking?[lr]::
68835::$$$message_0630_0099_0001$$$::This isn't the time to talk about some ritual that won't work, anyway."[lr]::
68836::$$$message_0630_0099_0002$$$::"O-oh yeah? Where's your proof that it won't work?"::
68837::$$$message_0630_0100_0000$$$::"Look, I don't know why, but nobody's ever won the Holy Grail War, right? So something must be wrong with the way the ritual works.[lr]::
68838::$$$message_0630_0100_0001$$$::...Besides, how else would you explain Sakura? If the Holy Grail is a path to Magic, are you saying that what's happening to Sakura is Magic, too?"[lr]::
68839::$$$message_0630_0100_0002$$$::Tohsaka goes quiet. I seem to have struck a nerve.::
68840::$$$message_0630_0101_0000$$$::"Illya, why did the Holy Grail War turn into this?[lr]::
68841::$$$message_0630_0101_0001$$$::Kotomine mentioned that there's something inside the Holy Grail.[lr]::
68842::$$$message_0630_0101_0002$$$::It's gotta be that Avenger thing you mentioned. Is it inside the Holy Grail? Not inside you or Sakura, but the Greater Grail?"::
68843::$$$message_0630_0102_0000$$$::"Oh, so Kotomine knew.[lr]::
68844::$$$message_0630_0102_0001$$$::He's a mage who was tainted by Avenger, like Sakura. He's probably known all along what was inside the Holy Grail."[lr]::
68845::$$$message_0630_0102_0002$$$::"Huh...? Kirei is like Sakura?"::
68846::$$$message_0630_0103_0000$$$::"Yeah. The rest of this concerns both of you.[lr]::
68847::$$$message_0630_0103_0001$$$::It's what Zouken is trying to acquire, and what changed Sakura. I'll tell you about the thing lurking in the Holy Grail, which contaminated the souls of the Heroic Spirits, which are comprised of neutral power.[lr]::
68848::$$$message_0630_0103_0002$$$::Its class name is Avenger.[lr]::
68849::$$$message_0630_0103_0003$$$::It's a Heroic Spirit that's on its way to becoming a successful case of the Third Magic, using the power of the Grail to acquire a shape as a living creature."::
68850::$$$message_0630_0104_0000$$$::"...What? Hang on, then how could anyone say Magic is irrelevant? You just said Magic."::
68851::$$$message_0630_0105_0000$$$::"No, Avenger's materialization doesn't use the Magic of the Holy Grail. It's a Heroic Spirit who's always innately had those attributes.[lr]::
68852::$$$message_0630_0105_0001$$$::It can materialize inside the Holy Grail because it's Avenger.[lr]::
68853::$$$message_0630_0105_0002$$$::The Greater Grail only summoned Avenger, who is capable of using the Third Magic; the grail itself isn't capable of using the Third Magic."::
68854::$$$message_0630_0106_0000$$$::"...? Um, so you're saying that it's a monster that could always materialize itself?[lr]::
68855::$$$message_0630_0106_0001$$$::It can just do the Third Magic on its own, even if the Greater Grail doesn't manage to activate Magic?"::
68856::$$$message_0630_0107_0000$$$::"Yes... It started in the third war.[lr]::
68857::$$$message_0630_0107_0001$$$::After failing in the first war and being eliminated early in the second, the Einzberns got desperate and summoned a Heroic Spirit specialized at killing."::

68865::$$$message_0630_0109_0003$$$::It's the greatest devil of Zoroastrianism[line2]an advocate of evil that has been battling for nine thousand years against the light god safeguarding humanity's goodness.[lr]::

68970::$$$message_0630_0144_0001$$$::Aŋra Mainiiu has changed so much while it's inside the Holy Grail that Sakura's personality will be erased the moment it comes out. If that happens, she won't even be a Master."::
