76235::$$$message_0706_0000_0000$$$::"...So hot."[lr]::
76236::$$$message_0706_0000_0001$$$::I open my eyes. I can't sleep.[lr]::
76237::$$$message_0706_0000_0002$$$::My pajamas are heavy with sweat. I kick off the covers.[lr]::
76238::$$$message_0706_0000_0003$$$::I wipe my forehead, finding that it's slick with enough sweat to soak a kitchen rag.::
76239::$$$message_0706_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76240::$$$message_0706_0001_0001$$$::...I can't think straight.[lr]::
76241::$$$message_0706_0001_0002$$$::Did the summer-like heat cook my brain?[lr]::
76242::$$$message_0706_0001_0003$$$::I think as hard as I can, but I can't tell what, when, or where this is.::
76243::$$$message_0706_0001_0004$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
76244::$$$message_0706_0001_0005$$$::I go out into the yard.[lr]::
76245::$$$message_0706_0001_0006$$$::I just want to cool off my burning body.[lr]::
76246::$$$message_0706_0001_0007$$$::...Was the room hot, or was it just me?[lr]::
76247::$$$message_0706_0001_0008$$$::Thinking is a pain, so I'll sleep in the shed tonight.[lr]::
76248::$$$message_0706_0001_0009$$$::It's cold in there.[lr]::
76249::$$$message_0706_0001_0010$$$::It doesn't matter whether it's hot or[line2]::
76250::$$$message_0706_0002_0000$$$::"Guh... Argh...!"[lr]::
76251::$$$message_0706_0002_0001$$$::Suddenly, stabbing pain drives me to my knees.[lr]::
76252::$$$message_0706_0002_0002$$$::"...Argh..."[lr]::
76253::$$$message_0706_0002_0003$$$::I keel over, panting hard.::
76254::$$$message_0706_0003_0000$$$::...I'm awake.[lr]::
76255::$$$message_0706_0003_0001$$$::I clutch my left arm, the source of the heat and pain.[lr]::
76256::$$$message_0706_0003_0002$$$::It's wrapped in a holy shroud.[lr]::
76257::$$$message_0706_0003_0003$$$::The red cloth locks the arm up tight.[lr]::
76258::$$$message_0706_0003_0004$$$::I can move it, but it's wrapped so tightly the blood is cut off.[lr]::
76259::$$$message_0706_0003_0005$$$::Then, I wonder if it's the cloth that's hurting my arm.::
76260::$$$message_0706_0004_0000$$$::"Maybe it'll actually go back to normal if I take this off."[lr]::
76261::$$$message_0706_0004_0001$$$::It's a terribly enticing delusion.[lr]::
76262::$$$message_0706_0004_0002$$$::I haven't even seen what's under the red cloth yet.[lr]::
76263::$$$message_0706_0004_0003$$$::It's not that I don't believe what the priest said, but what if he's wrong?::
76264::$$$message_0706_0005_0000$$$::Nothing's that wrong with my arm. Maybe if I unwrap it, it'll just be the same old arm I've always known.[lr]::
76265::$$$message_0706_0005_0001$$$::It can't possibly be made of steel.[lr]::
76266::$$$message_0706_0005_0002$$$::The only reason I can't move it is because it's bound up so tightly. If I unwrap it, I'm sure...[lr]::
