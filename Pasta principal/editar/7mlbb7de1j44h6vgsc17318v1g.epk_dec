64108::$$$message_0589_0000_0001$$$::My body still feels heavy.[lr]::
64109::$$$message_0589_0000_0002$$$::I need to make lunch for Sakura, but right now I want to lie down for a little while and give my mind a break.::
64110::$$$message_0589_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64111::$$$message_0589_0001_0001$$$::I flop onto the futon and bury my head in the pillow.::
64112::$$$message_0589_0002_0000$$$::...I know.[lr]::
64113::$$$message_0589_0002_0001$$$::Ever since that day, we've run out of time to stall any longer.[lr]::
64114::$$$message_0589_0002_0002$$$::I can't keep putting off the question.[lr]::
64115::$$$message_0589_0002_0003$$$::Sakura.[lr]::
64116::$$$message_0589_0002_0004$$$::I need to decide what I'm going to do, right here, right no[line2]::
64117::$$$message_0589_0003_0000$$$::"Shirou Emiya, I take it?"::
64118::$$$message_0589_0004_0000$$$::"Who's there!?"[lr]::
64119::$$$message_0589_0004_0001$$$::I jump out of bed.[lr]::
64120::$$$message_0589_0004_0002$$$::A voice. I'm sure I heard a voice.[lr]::
64121::$$$message_0589_0004_0003$$$::It came from within this room, very close by.::
64122::$$$message_0589_0005_0000$$$::"Ngh."[lr]::
64123::$$$message_0589_0005_0001$$$::A chill runs down my spine.[lr]::
64124::$$$message_0589_0005_0002$$$::...The scary thing is, I know the owner of the voice is in here, and I still have no idea where it is.::
64125::$$$message_0589_0006_0000$$$::"Your caution is unwarranted. I am not here to kill you."[lr]::
64126::$$$message_0589_0006_0001$$$::Someone whispers in my ear.[lr]::
64127::$$$message_0589_0006_0002$$$::This voice.[lr]::
64128::$$$message_0589_0006_0003$$$::The flowing yet robotic way of talking belongs to that skull-masked Servant.::
64129::$$$message_0589_0007_0000$$$::"Assassin."[lr]::
64130::$$$message_0589_0007_0001$$$::...What a disaster.[lr]::
64131::$$$message_0589_0007_0002$$$::Even if he specializes at stealth, how'd he manage to slip through the house's Bounded Field and get this far without anyone noticing!?::
64132::$$$message_0589_0008_0000$$$::"...You aren't here to kill me? Is this a social call, then?"::
64133::$$$message_0589_0009_0000$$$::I search for the presence I felt behind me while judging the distance to the door.[lr]::
64134::$$$message_0589_0009_0001$$$::It'll take three seconds to leap across the room to the hallway and dive into the yard.[lr]::
64135::$$$message_0589_0009_0002$$$::Assassin could kill me four times in that span of time.[lr]::
64136::$$$message_0589_0009_0003$$$::...Meaning that the only way to survive this is to entertain him.::
64137::$$$message_0589_0010_0000$$$::"Not by me. My Lord Mage desires a meeting."[lr]::
64138::$$$message_0589_0010_0001$$$::"Lord Mage? You mean Zouken?"[lr]::
64139::$$$message_0589_0010_0002$$$::"Yes. He is waiting for you at the Matou home. He has no desire to fight you. If you go alone, then I believe he will welcome you as a guest."::
64140::$$$message_0589_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
64141::$$$message_0589_0011_0001$$$::...Assassin's words are believable.[lr]::
64142::$$$message_0589_0011_0002$$$::If his goal was to kill me, I would've been dead as soon as he entered the room.::
64143::$$$message_0589_0012_0000$$$::The fact that it hasn't happened yet means that Zouken wants to talk.[lr]::
64144::$$$message_0589_0012_0001$$$::What he wants to talk about and whether it's a trap are separate issues.[lr]::
