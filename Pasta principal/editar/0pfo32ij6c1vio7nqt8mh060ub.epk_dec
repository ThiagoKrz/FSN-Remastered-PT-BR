39176::$$$message_0337_0000_0000$$$::"Oof..."[lr]::
39177::$$$message_0337_0000_0001$$$::I'm overwhelmed by the crowd the moment we get off the bus.[lr]::
39178::$$$message_0337_0000_0002$$$::It's lively in front of the train station.[lr]::
39179::$$$message_0337_0000_0003$$$::It's a nice weekend morning before 10 AM, so it would be weird for it to not be lively.::
39180::$$$message_0337_0001_0000$$$::"...I am surprised. There're this many people that gather when it's a weekend."[lr]::
39181::$$$message_0337_0001_0001$$$::Saber looks at the town, bewildered.[lr]::
39182::$$$message_0337_0001_0002$$$::She has never seen the town during the day, so her reaction is only natural.::
39183::$$$message_0337_0002_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
39184::$$$message_0337_0002_0001$$$::As I say this, I'm also stunned by the crowd.[lr]::
39185::$$$message_0337_0002_0002$$$:: "Well, where should we go? Do you two have any requests?"[lr]::
39186::$$$message_0337_0002_0003$$$::However...[lr]::
39187::$$$message_0337_0002_0004$$$::Unlike us, Tohsaka is full of energy.::
39188::$$$message_0337_0003_0000$$$::"Uh... That's troubling. I don't know any fun places."[lr]::
39189::$$$message_0337_0003_0001$$$::"I thought so. What about you, Saber? Do you have anywhere you want to go?"::
39190::$$$message_0337_0004_0000$$$::"Me...? No, I do not have any place that I am particularly interested in. First of all, I am Shirou's guardian.[lr]::
39191::$$$message_0337_0004_0001$$$::If this is you and Shirou's day off, please consider me not here."::
39192::$$$message_0337_0005_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
39193::$$$message_0337_0005_0001$$$::"Really? Then we can go where I want to go?[lr]::
39194::$$$message_0337_0005_0002$$$::Ohh. If you two don't have any input, does that mean you guys will give me absolute obedience to my plan?"::
39195::$$$message_0337_0006_0000$$$::"Whaaa[line2]"[lr]::
39196::$$$message_0337_0006_0001$$$::I feel a chill run up my spine.[lr]::
39197::$$$message_0337_0006_0002$$$::Tohsaka smirks at us with a scary stare.::
39198::$$$message_0337_0007_0000$$$::"H-Hold on, don't say it in a scary way![lr]::
39199::$$$message_0337_0007_0001$$$::First of all, I said I would keep you company, but I never said I was going on a d-date with you. This is just for the three of us to hang out."::
39200::$$$message_0337_0008_0000$$$::"Too bad, that's what society calls a date.[lr]::
39201::$$$message_0337_0008_0001$$$::Come on, give it up already. Girls will hate you if you don't know when to give up."::
39202::$$$message_0337_0009_0000$$$::"H-Hate me? Like who?"[lr]::
39203::$$$message_0337_0009_0001$$$::"Who could it be? Well, I guess being stubborn may be a good trait. Right, Saber?"::
39204::$$$message_0337_0010_0000$$$::"Yes. Shirou is a sore loser. His persistent mind is reassuring during battle."[lr]::
39205::$$$message_0337_0010_0001$$$::"See. Aren't you glad, Shirou?"::
39206::$$$message_0337_0011_0000$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
39207::$$$message_0337_0011_0001$$$::Tohsaka smiles.[lr]::
39208::$$$message_0337_0011_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Geez, what's so fun about making fun of other people!?[font italic=false]::
39209::$$$message_0337_0012_0000$$$::"Well, why don't we go to Verde first? You two haven't eaten breakfast yet, right? We can go window-shopping after a quick cup of tea to warm ourselves up."::
39210::$$$message_0337_0013_0000$$$::Tohsaka starts walking.[lr]::
39211::$$$message_0337_0013_0001$$$::[font italic=true]I think Verde is the name of the new department store that they recently made?[font italic=false]::
39212::$$$message_0337_0014_0000$$$::"Hey, I'm gonna leave you behind if you're slow. Breakfast is only till 10 AM, so we have to hurry before it ends."::
39213::$$$message_0337_0015_0000$$$::"Wai..."[lr]::
39214::$$$message_0337_0015_0001$$$::She won't stop, even if I call for her.[lr]::
39215::$$$message_0337_0015_0002$$$::It seems like Tohsaka has no time to waste and won't give me the time to settle down.::
39216::$$$message_0337_0016_0000$$$::"Shirou. Rin is walking away."[lr]::
39217::$$$message_0337_0016_0001$$$::Ugh... Geez, fine! I'll go anywhere you want![lr]::
39218::$$$message_0337_0016_0002$$$::I slap myself on both cheeks and get pumped up.::
39219::$$$message_0337_0017_0000$$$::"Come on, Saber! Don't get lost!"[lr]::
39220::$$$message_0337_0017_0001$$$::"Yes. Please do not lose sight of Rin either, Shirou."::
39221::$$$message_0337_0018_0000$$$::We both start running.[lr]::
39222::$$$message_0337_0018_0001$$$:: In the crowded town, Tohsaka doesn't look back.[lr]::
39223::$$$message_0337_0018_0002$$$::It seems like she's absolutely certain that we're going to follow her.::
39224::$$$message_0337_0019_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
39225::$$$message_0337_0019_0001$$$::Before I realize it, I've fallen into a more helpless situation.::
39226::$$$message_0337_0020_0000$$$::"This store's atmosphere is completely different from the first one.[lr]::
39227::$$$message_0337_0020_0001$$$::Rin, why are we here?"[lr]::
39228::$$$message_0337_0020_0002$$$::"It's just a little break. I thought you both may be tired. If we don't take a break now, it looks like your springs will wear out."[lr]::
39229::$$$message_0337_0020_0003$$$::"Oh? It certainly was a hectic two hours, but not enough exercise to have to take a break..."::
39230::$$$message_0337_0021_0000$$$::"Maybe for you, Saber. But, there are things that wear down in places you can't see.[lr]::
39231::$$$message_0337_0021_0001$$$::What seems like a normal floor to us can be a poisonous swamp to others."::
39232::$$$message_0337_0022_0000$$$::"Oh, I'm having this banana parfait. You should have this devil's sundae, Saber.[lr]::
39233::$$$message_0337_0022_0001$$$::What about you, Emiya? Do you eat sweets?"::
39234::$$$message_0337_0023_0000$$$::"Who'd eat that first thing in the morning? I'll have this coffee blend."[lr]::
39235::$$$message_0337_0023_0001$$$::"Oh my, such a boy. But are you sure? You'll be in trouble if you don't replenish your HP."[lr]::
39236::$$$message_0337_0023_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
39237::$$$message_0337_0023_0003$$$::It goes without saying, but eating ice cream together here would be a whole other dimension, and I have no appetite to begin with.[lr]::
39238::$$$message_0337_0023_0004$$$::Also, she's not good with technology, yet she knows something like that?::
39239::$$$message_0337_0024_0000$$$::"So stubborn. Well, that's fun in its own way, so it's fine."[lr]::
39240::$$$message_0337_0024_0001$$$:: I don't know what's so fun, but the red devil is smirking. [font italic=true]You should be the one eating the devil's sundae.[font italic=false][lr]::
39241::$$$message_0337_0024_0002$$$:: "Shirou, sugar intake is not to be taken lightly. If you are exhausted as Rin says, what about this 'mango rush & cream'?"[lr]::
39242::$$$message_0337_0024_0003$$$::Saber subtly offers me the menu.::
39243::$$$message_0337_0025_0000$$$::"...Yes. I cannot say this too loudly, but I would hide from the others to eat sweet fruits when we traveled for days in the military. Chocolate and the like are said to have originated from alchemy as well."[lr]::
39244::$$$message_0337_0025_0001$$$::"I've never heard that before.[lr]::
39245::$$$message_0337_0025_0002$$$::...So. Saber, you want to try the mango rush, too?"[lr]::
39246::$$$message_0337_0025_0003$$$::"Yes. I would appreciate if I can get a bite."::
39247::$$$message_0337_0026_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
39248::$$$message_0337_0026_0001$$$::...How lonely.[lr]::
39249::$$$message_0337_0026_0002$$$:: Saber has left my nervous self and has already fallen under Tohsaka's evil influence.::
39250::$$$message_0337_0027_0000$$$::"Oh, there's no need to hold back, Saber. We should go ahead and order both." [wm canskip=0][wdash canskip=0][lr]::
39251::$$$message_0337_0027_0001$$$::"Hm... As much as I would like to, that would be an unnecessary order. It is a different story if I were hungry, but I cannot possibly order excess food simply out of interest..." [wm canskip=0][wdash canskip=0]::
39252::$$$message_0337_0028_0000$$$::"That responsibility is the best part of dates. [lr]::
39253::$$$message_0337_0028_0001$$$::In this situation, the way it works is that Emiya treats us with a smile and we experience his generosity." [wm canskip=0][wdash canskip=0][lr]::
39254::$$$message_0337_0028_0002$$$::"I see, how wonderful. I am always in awe of your direction, Rin."::
39255::$$$message_0337_0029_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
39256::$$$message_0337_0029_0001$$$::This is beyond evil influence.[lr]::
39257::$$$message_0337_0029_0002$$$::Saber was already an enemy on Tohsaka's side.::
39258::$$$message_0337_0030_0000$$$::"Well then, time to go over the order. [lr]::
39259::$$$message_0337_0030_0001$$$::Banana parfait, devil's sundae, mango rush, and a coffee blend. Will that be all, sir?"[lr]::
39260::$$$message_0337_0030_0002$$$::"...Why are you asking me? That's fine, do what you want. It's not like I have the right to veto, right?[lr]::
39261::$$$message_0337_0030_0003$$$::And if you ask me, the orange sponge cake would be better than the mango rush."[lr]::
39262::$$$message_0337_0030_0004$$$::That would probably suit Tohsaka and Saber's tastes better.::
39263::$$$message_0337_0031_0000$$$::"Then I'll take your advice.[lr]::
39264::$$$message_0337_0031_0001$$$::Don't lose that part of you, Emiya."[lr]::
39265::$$$message_0337_0031_0002$$$::So began the least relaxing break imaginable.::
39266::$$$message_0337_0032_0000$$$::...Right. To be honest, I think I was nothing but nervous the first hour.[lr]::
39267::$$$message_0337_0032_0001$$$::Even by herself, Tohsaka stands out.[lr]::
39268::$$$message_0337_0032_0002$$$::Her eye-catching, vivid red clothes and long silky black hair.[lr]::
39269::$$$message_0337_0032_0003$$$::The colors alone stand out, [rep fliplr=0 tops=450,-350,,21 storages=„Ç∑„Éç„Çπ„Ç≥w1000b,„Ç∑„Éç„Çπ„Ç≥w1000a,„Çª„Ç§„Éê„ÉºÁßÅÊúç01a(Ëøë),ÂáõÁßÅÊúç03a(Ëøë) time=600 flipud=0 lefts=0,0,,13 poss=,,c, bg=iÊñ∞ÈÉΩ_„Ç∑„Éß„ÉÉ„Éî„É≥„Ç∞„É¢„Éº„É´ indexes=1000,2000,3000,4000 opacities=255,255,0,255][stopdash]but Tohsaka herself is a flawless beauty.[lr]::
39270::$$$message_0337_0032_0004$$$::With Saber by her side, it goes without saying that they make a striking pair.::
39271::$$$message_0337_0033_0000$$$::"Hm? What are you looking at?[lr]::
39272::$$$message_0337_0033_0001$$$::Oh, did you calm your nerves down?"[lr]::
39273::$$$message_0337_0033_0002$$$::"...Humph. Well, after being dragged around this much, then yeah."[lr]::
39274::$$$message_0337_0033_0003$$$::...Damn it. I really hate to admit it, but Tohsaka's suggestion to take a break was detestably correct.::
39275::$$$message_0337_0034_0000$$$::"Okay. Then, that means I can raise the bar a bit more, right?" ::
39276::$$$message_0337_0035_0000$$$::The strongest enemy smirks.[lr]::
39277::$$$message_0337_0035_0001$$$::Honestly, I can't even understand myself.[lr]::
39278::$$$message_0337_0035_0002$$$::I can fight back-to-back with her as a Master, but right now, even the gestures that I've gotten used to seeing makes my heart skip a beat.[lr]::
39279::$$$message_0337_0035_0003$$$::...It must be because I rashly got too close to her, so it's hard to interact with her normally now.::
39280::$$$message_0337_0036_0000$$$:: "Oh, yeah. Since we have the opportunity, let's do that next.[lr]::
39281::$$$message_0337_0036_0001$$$::Saber, are you interested in accessories?"[lr]::
39282::$$$message_0337_0036_0002$$$::"Ornaments, you say?[lr]::
39283::$$$message_0337_0036_0003$$$:: I do not collect them, but neither am I uninterested in looking at them."[lr]::
39284::$$$message_0337_0036_0004$$$:: "Then let's go to a store like that next. I want to make you try on a lot of things."::
39285::$$$message_0337_0037_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39286::$$$message_0337_0037_0001$$$::My nerves don't calm down. Her bright smile alone makes me dazzled.[lr]::
39287::$$$message_0337_0037_0002$$$::An unknown panic or agitation makes my chest hurt a bit.[lr]::
39288::$$$message_0337_0037_0003$$$::That was why I thought that we should hurry back home and devise a strategy, instead of going on a date.::
39289::$$$message_0337_0038_0000$$$::    But...[lr]::
39290::$$$message_0337_0038_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Um, what kind of magecraft was cast to make it turn out this way?[font italic=false]::
39291::$$$message_0337_0039_0000$$$::"Man, that was so funny. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a while."::
39292::$$$message_0337_0040_0000$$$::"Is that so? I cannot tell. Shirou did not look like himself earlier."::
39293::$$$message_0337_0041_0000$$$::"That's what's good. I didn't think he would look so much like a spoiled rich kid just by putting glasses on. You should've bought those glasses, Shirou."[lr]::
39294::$$$message_0337_0041_0001$$$::Tohsaka must've loved it, as she's still laughing.::
39295::$$$message_0337_0042_0000$$$::...It all happened about ten minutes ago.[lr]::
39296::$$$message_0337_0042_0001$$$::I don't know what Tohsaka was thinking, but she took us to the glasses shop and played around by putting fake glasses on Saber.::
39297::$$$message_0337_0043_0000$$$::I became a victim of circumstance as well, and one of the glasses she put on me became a hit for her.[lr]::
39298::$$$message_0337_0043_0001$$$::It was a pair of fake glasses with a thick frame and formal design.::
39299::$$$message_0337_0044_0000$$$::...Ugh, no thanks. Look, I'm never wearing fake glasses. I already have a babyface, so I can't afford to look even more like a kid.::
39300::$$$message_0337_0045_0000$$$::"Huh? Oh, I see, you were aware of it. But I don't think you need to worry. There's nothing wrong with the way you are now."::
39301::$$$message_0337_0046_0000$$$::"Stu[line2]There's a problem with the way I am now! My face can't be helped, but I need a bit more height!"[lr]::
39302::$$$message_0337_0046_0001$$$::"Oh? I think your height is average."[lr]::
39303::$$$message_0337_0046_0002$$$::"It's not. I'll be able to brace myself if I'm taller. I need at least Issei's height."::
39304::$$$message_0337_0047_0000$$$::"I said you don't have to worry. You'll still grow more."[lr]::
39305::$$$message_0337_0047_0001$$$::"...I'm glad to hear that, but what's your reasoning behind that?"::
39306::$$$message_0337_0048_0000$$$::"Huh... Oh, yeah. You're well-built, so you'll grow if you get your nutrition, right? I thought you'd grow if you use photosynthesis."[lr]::
39307::$$$message_0337_0048_0001$$$::"What kind of leaf are you talking about? Don't treat me like some flower."::
39308::$$$message_0337_0049_0000$$$::"Oh. Emiya, are you mad...?"[lr]::
39309::$$$message_0337_0049_0001$$$::"Nah. I'll take it with a grain of salt... Well, it seems like I can look forward to it if you say so."::
39310::$$$message_0337_0050_0000$$$::"...Yes. I can't make any promises about your height, but I'm sure you'll become a fine man. That I can guarantee for sure, Shirou." [lr]::
39311::$$$message_0337_0050_0001$$$::"Wha[line2]"[lr]::
39312::$$$message_0337_0050_0002$$$::[font italic=true]W-Why would you say things that make my face boil!?[font italic=false]::
39313::$$$message_0337_0051_0000$$$::"Hah, you're blushing. I like you since your emotions always show on your face."[lr]::
39314::$$$message_0337_0051_0001$$$::"Ugh..."[lr]::
39315::$$$message_0337_0051_0002$$$::S-She's playing around with me.[lr]::
39316::$$$message_0337_0051_0003$$$::She's definitely playing around with me.::
39317::$$$message_0337_0052_0000$$$::"Guh, you evil woman! Is it fun for you to tease a guy your age!?"::
39318::$$$message_0337_0053_0000$$$::"Of course. It depends on the person, but your reactions are the best."[lr]::
39319::$$$message_0337_0053_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...Dear God.[font italic=false][lr]::
39320::$$$message_0337_0053_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Please give her divine punishment.[font italic=false][lr]::
39321::$$$message_0337_0053_0003$$$::[font italic=true]Not for my sake, but for the sake of all the guys at my school.::
39322::$$$message_0337_0054_0000$$$::"Oh, let's stop playing around with Shirou and get to the main part. Do you want to let out some stress before lunch?"[lr]::
39323::$$$message_0337_0054_0001$$$::Tohsaka puts her fists together and swings them.::
39324::$$$message_0337_0055_0000$$$::"...Could it be...?"[lr]::
39325::$$$message_0337_0055_0001$$$::It's obvious from her gesture.[lr]::
39326::$$$message_0337_0055_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Well, but is it possible for a girl to suggest it as part of the date course...?[font italic=false]::
39327::$$$message_0337_0056_0000$$$::"What else could there be other than a batting cage, Shirou? Don't tell me you don't know it."[lr]::
39328::$$$message_0337_0056_0001$$$::Tohsaka, the (former) school idol, asks me if I'm serious.::
39329::$$$message_0337_0057_0000$$$::"Of course I know![lr]::
39330::$$$message_0337_0057_0001$$$::What I want to say is that batting cages aren't for girls..."[lr]::
39331::$$$message_0337_0057_0002$$$::Saying that, I imagine Tohsaka standing in the batter's box.::
39332::$$$message_0337_0058_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
39333::$$$message_0337_0058_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...Crap. It does look strange, but why does she look so reliable?[font italic=false]::
39334::$$$message_0337_0059_0000$$$::"What, then do you want to go to the aquarium instead? I think they had the penguin army vs. a giant seal from the North Sea, the flaming freezing three-game match, but it's a third-rate attraction."::
39335::$$$message_0337_0060_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39336::$$$message_0337_0060_0001$$$::Well, I think it's a second-rate attraction, but I don't know about going to an aquarium when it's such a nice day outside.::
39337::$$$message_0337_0061_0000$$$::"Rin. What is a batting cage?"[lr]::
39338::$$$message_0337_0061_0001$$$::"Huh? Oh, well it's something you would be good at. You can say that it's a well-rounded physical exercise considered to be special training in some cases."[lr]::
39339::$$$message_0337_0061_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Woah.[font italic=false][lr]::
39340::$$$message_0337_0061_0003$$$::Tohsaka's putting it in a ridiculous way.::
39341::$$$message_0337_0062_0000$$$::"...Hm. I cannot ignore that."[lr]::
39342::$$$message_0337_0062_0001$$$::"Yeah, you should try it since it feels good. I bet you'll be able to win all the prizes."[lr]::
39343::$$$message_0337_0062_0002$$$::Tohsaka raises Saber's expectations irresponsibly and starts walking again.::
39344::$$$message_0337_0063_0000$$$::"...Ugh."[lr]::
39345::$$$message_0337_0063_0001$$$::I watch her back and start running, having no other choice.[lr]::
39346::$$$message_0337_0063_0002$$$::There's no point arguing against Tohsaka's energy.[lr]::
39347::$$$message_0337_0063_0003$$$::I can't stop her, and it doesn't feel too bad being dragged around like this.::
39348::$$$message_0337_0064_0000$$$::So that's what it means.[lr]::
39349::$$$message_0337_0064_0001$$$::My nerves calm down since I'm having fun.[lr]::
39350::$$$message_0337_0064_0002$$$::I was taken around so much that I didn't have time to rest, and the nervousness went away.[lr]::
39351::$$$message_0337_0064_0003$$$::Tohsaka urges me to go to the next place, and I respond reluctantly, while Saber watches over us quietly.::
39352::$$$message_0337_0065_0000$$$::...That was really fun.[lr]::
39353::$$$message_0337_0065_0001$$$::The town I only used to walk by...[lr]::
39354::$$$message_0337_0065_0002$$$::I didn't know that all the things I didn't involve myself in were so meaningful.::
39355::$$$message_0337_0066_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39356::$$$message_0337_0066_0001$$$::As soon as I think so, something like a cage falls on me, and it makes sense.[lr]::
39357::$$$message_0337_0066_0002$$$::[font italic=true]You don't deserve this.[font italic=false][lr]::
39358::$$$message_0337_0066_0003$$$::[font italic=true]You're unworthy of this.[font italic=false][lr]::
39359::$$$message_0337_0066_0004$$$::Somewhere deep down, I tell myself.::
39360::$$$message_0337_0067_0000$$$::    I-I'm tired.[lr]::
39361::$$$message_0337_0067_0001$$$::I never expected that I would be at bat five times for thirty pitches each, for a total of 150 swings.[lr]::
39362::$$$message_0337_0067_0002$$$::It's all because...::
39363::$$$message_0337_0068_0000$$$::"W-What is it, Shirou? It is troubling if you look at me like that."[lr]::
39364::$$$message_0337_0068_0001$$$::It's because she's a sore loser.::
39365::$$$message_0337_0069_0000$$$::"That was a miscalculation... I didn't think that Saber would be so competitive."[lr]::
39366::$$$message_0337_0069_0001$$$::Tohsaka sighs next to me.[lr]::
39367::$$$message_0337_0069_0002$$$::She also...::
39368::$$$message_0337_0070_0000$$$::"Oh, I'll only play one game. My hands will get rough if I grip the bat that much."[lr]::
39369::$$$message_0337_0070_0001$$$::...Said something like that, but ended up playing another game with Saber, then complained afterwards about how her shoulders were tired and her hands hurt.::
39370::$$$message_0337_0071_0000$$$::What are you saying? You only played twice and just held onto the bat in the back after that. I did it five times. Five times! And at the fastest speed too![lr]::
39371::$$$message_0337_0071_0001$$$::...Man, Saber would get mad if I take it too easy on her but would sulk if I beat her too bad. It was a hell of an hour."::
39372::$$$message_0337_0072_0000$$$::"I-I did not sulk! I was only filled with spirit. First of all, this is nothing compared to our matches in the dojo. It is your fault for getting tired."::
39373::$$$message_0337_0073_0000$$$::"...I get it. Saber's the type to get mad when she loses in games, huh?"[lr]::
39374::$$$message_0337_0073_0001$$$::I sigh and wobble forward.::
39375::$$$message_0337_0074_0000$$$::Here's what I found out today. First, don't bet with Saber.[lr]::
39376::$$$message_0337_0074_0001$$$::Second, a rule where the one who achieves ten more hits than their opponent wins becomes an eternal hell if the abilities of those playing are equal.[lr]::
39377::$$$message_0337_0074_0002$$$::Third, Saber is weaker than us if she limits her magical energy.::
39378::$$$message_0337_0075_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...Or rather, is Tohsaka the abnormal one for hitting 120 kmph balls like it's nothing?[font italic=false][lr]::
39379::$$$message_0337_0075_0001$$$::It's natural since Saber is the smallest out of all of us, so it goes without saying that Tohsaka is strong for a girl.::
39380::$$$message_0337_0076_0000$$$::"How rude. Batting doesn't equal arm strength.[lr]::
39381::$$$message_0337_0076_0001$$$::Even a girl can hit if the swing speed and the angles are right."::
39382::$$$message_0337_0077_0000$$$::"Well, that's for one or two pitches. Usually their arm cramps up. Aren't you doing push-ups before you go to bed? That's the only thing I can think of."[lr]::
39383::$$$message_0337_0077_0001$$$::I say sarcastically, as if to get back at her.[lr]::
39384::$$$message_0337_0077_0002$$$::However...::
39385::$$$message_0337_0078_0000$$$::"...I-I do. Is there a problem?"[lr]::
39386::$$$message_0337_0078_0001$$$::"...Uh, no... Nice."[lr]::
39387::$$$message_0337_0078_0002$$$::Sometimes she makes these counterattacks, so I wasn't able to make a comeback at all.::
39388::$$$message_0337_0079_0000$$$::"A-Anyway, let's have lunch. It's already past 2 PM. I need to eat something, since I'm getting dizzy."[lr]::
39389::$$$message_0337_0079_0001$$$::A family restaurant along the bridge should be the most convenient around here.[lr]::
39390::$$$message_0337_0079_0002$$$::There's a lot on the menu, so Saber shouldn't have any complaints either.::
39391::$$$message_0337_0080_0000$$$::"Is that fine with you, Tohsaka? It's not like you have any place in mind, right?"[lr]::
39392::$$$message_0337_0080_0001$$$::I call to Tohsaka.::
39393::$$$message_0337_0081_0000$$$::"I-I do. It's not like it has to be there, but I have it planned out."[lr]::
39394::$$$message_0337_0081_0001$$$::"Oh, okay. So, where is it?"::
39395::$$$message_0337_0082_0000$$$::"...Here."[lr]::
39396::$$$message_0337_0082_0001$$$::"Huh? What do you mean 'here'?"[lr]::
39397::$$$message_0337_0082_0002$$$::"I mean [font italic=true]here[font italic=false]. It's a nice day out, so we're going to have a picnic at the park."::
39398::$$$message_0337_0083_0000$$$::...I look around.[lr]::
39399::$$$message_0337_0083_0001$$$::I don't see any food place or even a hotdog stand.::
39400::$$$message_0337_0084_0000$$$::"Tohsaka, don't tell me you're planning to get delivery."[lr]::
39401::$$$message_0337_0084_0001$$$:: "...Hey now. What do you think that tote bag you've been carrying this whole time is?"[lr]::
39402::$$$message_0337_0084_0002$$$::"Huh...?"::
39403::$$$message_0337_0085_0000$$$::[font italic=true]Oh.[font italic=false][lr]::
39404::$$$message_0337_0085_0001$$$::Come to think of it, she did give me this bag to carry this morning. ::
39405::$$$message_0337_0086_0000$$$::"...Hm. It smells like mustard. So this is..."[lr]::
39406::$$$message_0337_0086_0001$$$::"Lunch, of course. Didn't I mention that I prepared that much?"::
39407::$$$message_0337_0087_0000$$$::She glares at me in objection.[lr]::
39408::$$$message_0337_0087_0001$$$::...Come to think of it, she did say something like that.::
39409::$$$message_0337_0088_0000$$$::"Wow, I'm surprised. I didn't think this would be that well thought-through."::
39410::$$$message_0337_0089_0000$$$::"Of course it is. I invited you, so I prepared accordingly."::
39411::$$$message_0337_0090_0000$$$::"Yeah, the mystery's also solved now. You used the bread for this, huh?[lr]::
39412::$$$message_0337_0090_0001$$$::Man, I totally thought you got hungry in the middle of the night and ate it. It seems absurd to eat a whole loaf, but I thought it might be possible in your case."::
39413::$$$message_0337_0091_0000$$$::[font italic=true]I see, I see.[font italic=false][lr]::
39414::$$$message_0337_0091_0001$$$::I nod twice, thinking that I got a huge load off my chest.[lr]::
39415::$$$message_0337_0091_0002$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
39416::$$$message_0337_0091_0003$$$::When I look up, Tohsaka was making a scary face.::
39417::$$$message_0337_0092_0000$$$::"Emiya?"[lr]::
39418::$$$message_0337_0092_0001$$$::"Y-Yeah? What is it, Tohsaka?"::
39419::$$$message_0337_0093_0000$$$::"Can you stop talking and start preparing lunch? All the utensils are inside the tote bag. Also, I'm going to kill you if you're too slow."[lr]::
39420::$$$message_0337_0093_0001$$$::"Oh... Yes. I will do my best."::
39421::$$$message_0337_0094_0000$$$::I secure our spot on the grass.[lr]::
39422::$$$message_0337_0094_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Man, that was scary.[font italic=false][lr]::
39423::$$$message_0337_0094_0002$$$::It's bad for my heart for her to say a joke that doesn't sound like a joke with that big smile...::
39424::$$$message_0337_0095_0000$$$::And...[lr]::
39425::$$$message_0337_0095_0001$$$::Lunch starts two hours late, but...::
39426::$$$message_0337_0096_0000$$$::"Huh? What happened, Shirou? Why are you spacing out?[lr]::
39427::$$$message_0337_0096_0001$$$::...Oh, are you not good with spicy food?"::
39428::$$$message_0337_0097_0000$$$::Right next to me...[lr]::
39429::$$$message_0337_0097_0001$$$::Tohsaka, who's sitting in a position close enough to touch her if I reach out, says.::
39430::$$$message_0337_0098_0000$$$::"Huh? Oh, no, I'm fine. It's an intense flavor, but this is good."[lr]::
39431::$$$message_0337_0098_0001$$$::I say my honest opinion and take another bite.::
39432::$$$message_0337_0099_0000$$$::"Really? That's good. It's a talent to be able to make a sandwich that tastes bad, right? I thought for a second that I had that useless talent."[lr]::
39433::$$$message_0337_0099_0001$$$::Tohsaka laughs delightfully.::
39434::$$$message_0337_0100_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39435::$$$message_0337_0100_0001$$$::If I looked like I was spacing out, it was probably because she was dazzling.::
39436::$$$message_0337_0101_0000$$$::We eat lunch on the grass under the clear blue sky.[lr]::
39437::$$$message_0337_0101_0001$$$::Even that by itself is peaceful enough, but having Tohsaka there is more than I can handle and my nerves from this morning return.::
39438::$$$message_0337_0102_0000$$$::"Oh. You have a piece of tomato on your lip. Do you want me to get it for you?"[lr]::
39439::$$$message_0337_0102_0001$$$::"Bu...! W-W-W-W-W-What are you saying all of a sudden!? I can get that myself!"[lr]::
39440::$$$message_0337_0102_0002$$$::I wipe my mouth with my sleeve.::
39441::$$$message_0337_0103_0000$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
39442::$$$message_0337_0103_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Shoot.[font italic=false][lr]::
39443::$$$message_0337_0103_0002$$$::I got an unlucky red stain on my clothes now.::
39444::$$$message_0337_0104_0000$$$::"Oops, I guess I played around too much. I'm sorry, it was too funny since you react exactly how I expect you to."::
39445::$$$message_0337_0105_0000$$$::I don't know if she's apologizing or suppressing her laughter, but she hands me a napkin while she holds her stomach.::
39446::$$$message_0337_0106_0000$$$::"...Humph. Whatever, I've been like this the whole day anyway. I don't care."[lr]::
39447::$$$message_0337_0106_0001$$$::I accept the napkin and wipe my sleeve.[lr]::
39448::$$$message_0337_0106_0002$$$::The red stain doesn't come off.[lr]::
39449::$$$message_0337_0106_0003$$$::...Hm. Tohsaka must've used an original sauce.[lr]::
39450::$$$message_0337_0106_0004$$$::The stain is quite stubborn and doesn't easily come off.::
39451::$$$message_0337_0107_0000$$$::"But just you watch. I'll learn from today's lesson and won't budge from anything starting tomorrow. Don't think it'll go your way forever."::
39452::$$$message_0337_0108_0000$$$::"Oh. So that means I don't have to hold back starting tomorrow, huh?[lr]::
39453::$$$message_0337_0108_0001$$$::That's good, I was getting tired of putting up a fa√ßade."[lr]::
39454::$$$message_0337_0108_0002$$$::The red devil replies calmly.::
39455::$$$message_0337_0109_0000$$$::"...Oh, no, I take that back. It'll take some time, so I'd appreciate it if you can keep it at that level."::
39456::$$$message_0337_0110_0000$$$::"Really? If you say so, but let me know if you want to level up. I'll knock you out without reserve."::
39457::$$$message_0337_0111_0000$$$::"...Damn. I'll get you someday."[lr]::
39458::$$$message_0337_0111_0001$$$::I'm not bitter that I lost, but I complain like I am.[lr]::
39459::$$$message_0337_0111_0002$$$::...It's somehow really vexing, so I take it out on the sandwich in front of me.::
39460::$$$message_0337_0112_0000$$$::I eat up the sandwiches.[lr]::
39461::$$$message_0337_0112_0001$$$::I was hungry and it's Tohsaka's handmade meal, so I'm going to eat it all by myself.[lr]::
39462::$$$message_0337_0112_0002$$$::...Well, Saber already consumed a third of the sandwiches.::
39463::$$$message_0337_0113_0000$$$::So Saber and I eat the sandwiches.[lr]::
39464::$$$message_0337_0113_0001$$$::Tohsaka must be full, as she watches us.::
39465::$$$message_0337_0114_0000$$$::"Your body seems to be doing well. It looks like I can pull you around without holding back in the afternoon."::
39466::$$$message_0337_0115_0000$$$::She makes an evil smile again.[lr]::
39467::$$$message_0337_0115_0001$$$::That's more like...[lr]::
39468::$$$message_0337_0115_0002$$$::She's looking forward to seeing me worn out from being dragged around than the actual activities itself.::
39469::$$$message_0337_0116_0000$$$::"Humph, don't take me too lightly. I won't complain just from being pulled around. Yesterday aside, I've been doing well today."::
39470::$$$message_0337_0117_0000$$$::"I see. Then I guess you're all right."[lr]::
39471::$$$message_0337_0117_0001$$$::Tohsaka sighs with relief and reaches for a sandwich.[lr]::
39472::$$$message_0337_0117_0002$$$::It's as if the weight is off her shoulders.::
39473::$$$message_0337_0118_0000$$$::"...?"[lr]::
39474::$$$message_0337_0118_0001$$$::The moment I tilt my head, wondering why she would say that...[lr]::
39475::$$$message_0337_0118_0002$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
39476::$$$message_0337_0118_0003$$$::Everything fits together.::
39477::$$$message_0337_0119_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39478::$$$message_0337_0119_0001$$$::Come to think of it, it was really unnatural.[lr]::
39479::$$$message_0337_0119_0002$$$::The reason Tohsaka came to my place.[lr]::
39480::$$$message_0337_0119_0003$$$::Archer knew what was wrong with my body.[lr]::
39481::$$$message_0337_0119_0004$$$::He must've heard that I Projected his swords and knew there was something wrong with my body.::
39482::$$$message_0337_0120_0000$$$::That's fine.[lr]::
39483::$$$message_0337_0120_0001$$$::But Archer, who wasn't there at the time, knew about the Projection because Tohsaka told him.[lr]::
39484::$$$message_0337_0120_0002$$$::Then...[lr]::
39485::$$$message_0337_0120_0003$$$::Just like Tohsaka told Archer about our battle with Caster, didn't Archer tell Tohsaka about the penalty on my body...?::
39486::$$$message_0337_0121_0000$$$::"Tohsaka."[lr]::
39487::$$$message_0337_0121_0001$$$::"Huh? What?"[lr]::
39488::$$$message_0337_0121_0002$$$::"Why did you come to my place yesterday? It's strange for you to stay over too. I didn't notice all this yesterday because Fuji-nee stirred things up."::
39489::$$$message_0337_0122_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
39490::$$$message_0337_0122_0001$$$::A brief moment.[lr]::
39491::$$$message_0337_0122_0002$$$::But I hear Tohsaka gasp. ::
39492::$$$message_0337_0123_0000$$$::"I don't particularly have a reason. I just felt like it yesterday. I thought it might be fun once in a while."[lr]::
39493::$$$message_0337_0123_0001$$$::"I see. It certainly was lively and fun yesterday."[lr]::
39494::$$$message_0337_0123_0002$$$::"Right?"[lr]::
39495::$$$message_0337_0123_0003$$$::"Yeah. But thank you."::
39496::$$$message_0337_0124_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
39497::$$$message_0337_0124_0001$$$::[font italic=true]Wow.[font italic=false][lr]::
39498::$$$message_0337_0124_0002$$$::She turned red in an instant.::
39499::$$$message_0337_0125_0000$$$::"W-W-W-What are you misunderstanding....!? I-I wasn't concerned about you...!"[lr]::
39500::$$$message_0337_0125_0001$$$::"I know, it's not good to have your ally die. That's why you came to check up on me, right?"::
39501::$$$message_0337_0126_0000$$$::"Uh... T-That's right. You're pretty smart."[lr]::
39502::$$$message_0337_0126_0001$$$::"Yeah. But I still appreciate it.[lr]::
39503::$$$message_0337_0126_0002$$$::I don't know what you were planning, but I know you cared for me."::
39504::$$$message_0337_0127_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
39505::$$$message_0337_0127_0001$$$::She groans in dissatisfaction, with her face still red.[lr]::
39506::$$$message_0337_0127_0002$$$::That gesture is so cute it makes me smile.::
39507::$$$message_0337_0128_0000$$$::"...I see, I get it."[lr]::
39508::$$$message_0337_0128_0001$$$::I guess I get it.[lr]::
39509::$$$message_0337_0128_0002$$$::It might be a different kind, but making the person you like embarrassed makes me really happy.::
39510::$$$message_0337_0129_0000$$$::The weather changes once we finish lunch.[lr]::
39511::$$$message_0337_0129_0001$$$::The sky that was clear is now clouded and it looks like it could rain at any moment.::
