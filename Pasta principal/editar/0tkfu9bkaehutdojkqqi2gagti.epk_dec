57107::$$$message_0503_0000_0000$$$::Something was making a dragging sound.[lr]::
57108::$$$message_0503_0000_0001$$$::She knew this sound well.[lr]::
57109::$$$message_0503_0000_0002$$$::It was the scraping of countless insects dragging bodies, the chitter of the multitudes swarming over the walls.::
57110::$$$message_0503_0001_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57111::$$$message_0503_0001_0001$$$::She knows this place well.[lr]::
57112::$$$message_0503_0001_0002$$$::This dark, damp, hidden room.[lr]::
57113::$$$message_0503_0001_0003$$$::This underground mausoleum.[lr]::
57114::$$$message_0503_0001_0004$$$::This green darkness was the first room the Matous put her in when they adopted her.::
57115::$$$message_0503_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57116::$$$message_0503_0002_0001$$$::A lone figure stands in the darkness.[lr]::
57117::$$$message_0503_0002_0002$$$::...She isn't sure whether to call him human, but he resembles a human.[lr]::
57118::$$$message_0503_0002_0003$$$::The figure called for her and ordered her to fight instead of Shinji Matou.::
57119::$$$message_0503_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57120::$$$message_0503_0003_0001$$$::She was prepared for this.[lr]::
57121::$$$message_0503_0003_0002$$$::At the very least, she accepted that it would come to this, two days ago.[lr]::
57122::$$$message_0503_0003_0003$$$::But now, her determination was waning.[lr]::
57123::$$$message_0503_0003_0004$$$::She'd been losing her will to fight ever since she learned that he[line2]that Shirou Emiya was a Master.::
57124::$$$message_0503_0004_0000$$$::She was sent to the Emiya household to monitor him.[lr]::
57125::$$$message_0503_0004_0001$$$::But Shirou Emiya didn't have the aptitude to be a Master, and he knew nothing of the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
57126::$$$message_0503_0004_0002$$$::She figured that out right away. So, her assignment never really mattered to begin with.[lr]::
57127::$$$message_0503_0004_0003$$$::Using surveillance as an excuse, she kept living as Shirou Emiya's kouhai.::
57128::$$$message_0503_0005_0000$$$::She told herself that they wouldn't have to fight.[lr]::
57129::$$$message_0503_0005_0001$$$::She was optimistic that even if her identity came out some day, they would never end up fighting each other.[lr]::
57130::$$$message_0503_0005_0002$$$::So...how did it come to this?::
57131::$$$message_0503_0006_0000$$$::"...Grandfather. Do the Masters have to kill each other?"::
57132::$$$message_0503_0007_0000$$$::She knew how the old man would answer,[lr]::
57133::$$$message_0503_0007_0001$$$::but she still had to ask.[lr]::
57134::$$$message_0503_0007_0002$$$::And yet...[lr]::
57135::$$$message_0503_0007_0003$$$::"Well...if you insist, you may show mercy to one or two of them, as long as you take their Servants. You can turn the remaining Masters into playthings or puppets, as you wish."[lr]::
57136::$$$message_0503_0007_0004$$$::His answer was slightly different than she anticipated.::
57137::$$$message_0503_0008_0000$$$::"...Huh?"::
57138::$$$message_0503_0009_0000$$$::"You don't understand? You don't have to kill all of them. Dispose of the ones that are too dangerous to leave alive, of course, but it's fine to overlook ones that aren't any threat to you.[lr]::
57139::$$$message_0503_0009_0001$$$::This is our deepest desire, yes, but I can make a few allowances for my adorable granddaughter."::
57140::$$$message_0503_0010_0000$$$::Just slightly, his words eased her caution.[lr]::
57141::$$$message_0503_0010_0001$$$::...Sometimes, the old man could be kind.[lr]::
57142::$$$message_0503_0010_0002$$$::When "teaching" her the Matou ways, he was utterly inhuman, displaying the savagery of a beast or worm.[lr]::
57143::$$$message_0503_0010_0003$$$::In conversation, however, he could give off the air of a pleasant older gentleman.::
57144::$$$message_0503_0011_0000$$$::"..."::
57145::$$$message_0503_0012_0000$$$::But she knew not to be fooled.[lr]::
57146::$$$message_0503_0012_0001$$$::This could be a momentary whim, or some calculated manipulation. More importantly, if she agreed now, then she was bound to end up fighting him.[lr]::
57147::$$$message_0503_0012_0002$$$::Even if she didn't have to kill him, she still didn't want to fight him.::
57148::$$$message_0503_0013_0000$$$::"Still not satisfied? ...What a silly girl you are. You'll never obtain what you desire by being so timid. This is a good opportunity, you know. You can just take what you want by force.[lr]::
57149::$$$message_0503_0013_0001$$$::Sakura, how long do you intend to play observer? Just take what you want. You have the power and privilege to do so."::
57150::$$$message_0503_0014_0000$$$::"..."::
57151::$$$message_0503_0015_0000$$$::She didn't answer.[lr]::
57152::$$$message_0503_0015_0001$$$::There wasn't anything she wanted, to begin with.[lr]::
57153::$$$message_0503_0015_0002$$$::She simply had a longing, not even a hope that he might accept her.::
57154::$$$message_0503_0016_0000$$$::She is dirty and impure, not worthy of him.[lr]::
57155::$$$message_0503_0016_0001$$$::So, she would work to become someone good enough to sit by his side.[lr]::
57156::$$$message_0503_0016_0002$$$::She would be happy just to stay by him until that time comes.[lr]::
57157::$$$message_0503_0016_0003$$$::It would be disastrous to hope for more.[lr]::
57158::$$$message_0503_0016_0004$$$::...Not just for herself.[lr]::
57159::$$$message_0503_0016_0005$$$::It would surely cause him to meet an unwelcome end as well.::
57160::$$$message_0503_0017_0000$$$::"...Grandfather. I cannot fight. I'll keep letting Shinji have Rider."::
57161::$$$message_0503_0018_0000$$$::She said it in a trembling voice, knowing she might draw her grandfather's ire.[lr]::
57162::$$$message_0503_0018_0001$$$::She knew well what it meant to defy him.::
57163::$$$message_0503_0019_0000$$$::"..."::
57164::$$$message_0503_0020_0000$$$::Her limbs quiver.[lr]::
57165::$$$message_0503_0020_0001$$$::She was so terrified, she might cry.[lr]::
57166::$$$message_0503_0020_0002$$$::However, it wasn't her grandfather's wrath she was afraid of.[lr]::
57167::$$$message_0503_0020_0003$$$::No, what she fears the most is...[lr]::
57168::$$$message_0503_0020_0004$$$::...when she can no longer bear the pain, she might end up obeying the old man's will in the end.::
57169::$$$message_0503_0021_0000$$$::"...Hm. No helping that, I suppose. After all, I wouldn't want to be too forceful and lose my precious heir. I'll just watch from the sidelines this time."::
57170::$$$message_0503_0022_0000$$$::"..."::
57171::$$$message_0503_0023_0000$$$::She gasps.[lr]::
57172::$$$message_0503_0023_0001$$$::She doesn't know how serious he is, but her grandfather has accepted her request.[lr]::
57173::$$$message_0503_0023_0002$$$::Her trembling stops, and warm relief floods her chest.::
57174::$$$message_0503_0024_0000$$$::   And then, when her guard was down...[lr]::
57175::$$$message_0503_0024_0001$$$::"That would be a bit vexing, though. This time, the Tohsaka girl is of rather fine quality among the potential hosts. She may just have a chance if fortune favors her."[lr]::
57176::$$$message_0503_0024_0002$$$::The old man remarks in a disappointed tone.::
57177::$$$message_0503_0025_0000$$$::"My...sister?"::
57178::$$$message_0503_0026_0000$$$::The other shoe drops.[lr]::
57179::$$$message_0503_0026_0001$$$::Her intuition tells her that her sister can definitely win this war.[lr]::
57180::$$$message_0503_0026_0002$$$::...That's just the kind of person she is, dashing gallantly through life, getting everything she wants like it's the most natural thing in the world.[lr]::
57181::$$$message_0503_0026_0003$$$::...She won't even spare a single glance for Sakura, and carries off everything she wants with her.[lr]::
57182::$$$message_0503_0026_0004$$$::Then...she is sure to win.::
57183::$$$message_0503_0027_0000$$$::"..."::
57184::$$$message_0503_0028_0000$$$::An icy feeling spreads through her body.[lr]::
57185::$$$message_0503_0028_0001$$$::...She doesn't care.[lr]::
57186::$$$message_0503_0028_0002$$$::She's used to it.[lr]::
57187::$$$message_0503_0028_0003$$$::She's used to it.[lr]::
57188::$$$message_0503_0028_0004$$$::She's used to it.[lr]::
57189::$$$message_0503_0028_0005$$$::   She got used to it a long time ago.::
57190::$$$message_0503_0029_0000$$$::Nee-san will get everything.[lr]::
57191::$$$message_0503_0029_0001$$$::All the pain I've put up with, the bright future I've always hated, and worst of all, the one person close to me, are all going to disappear...::
57192::$$$message_0503_0030_0000$$$::"..."::
57193::$$$message_0503_0031_0000$$$::...The space around her feet warps.[lr]::
57194::$$$message_0503_0031_0001$$$::The words make her dizzy, and she vomits.[lr]::
57195::$$$message_0503_0031_0002$$$::...Her chest hurts.[lr]::
57196::$$$message_0503_0031_0003$$$::Then, in her chest,[lr]::
57197::$$$message_0503_0031_0004$$$::she's assailed by a nasty, stabbing sensation.::
57198::$$$message_0503_0032_0000$$$::...It's begun to rain.[lr]::
57199::$$$message_0503_0032_0001$$$::Cold winter rain hammers the rain gutter.::
57200::$$$message_0503_0033_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
57201::$$$message_0503_0033_0001$$$::She slowly opens her eyes.[lr]::
57202::$$$message_0503_0033_0002$$$::...Apparently, she was dreaming about the events of the last few days.[lr]::
57203::$$$message_0503_0033_0003$$$::She was sleeping on this operating table, in this room made of stone.[lr]::
57204::$$$message_0503_0033_0004$$$::In front of her is a black[line2]a priest she's never seen before, who somehow reminds her of herself.::
57205::$$$message_0503_0034_0000$$$::"You're awake. Do you require an explanation, Sakura Matou?"[lr]::
57206::$$$message_0503_0034_0001$$$::"...No. I know my own body."[lr]::
57207::$$$message_0503_0034_0002$$$::Her answer is plain.[lr]::
57208::$$$message_0503_0034_0003$$$::Without looking at the priest, she stares at the wall, listening to the rhythm of the rain.::
57209::$$$message_0503_0035_0000$$$::"Very well. Then get dressed, quickly. Rin Tohsaka and Shirou Emiya are waiting next door. I need to explain your condition to them. I assume you'd rather not flee the building without your clothes."[lr]::
57210::$$$message_0503_0035_0001$$$::"...You'll let me run away?"[lr]::
57211::$$$message_0503_0035_0002$$$::"You are free to flee or stay. I simply saved your life. It is not my place to decide your next actions.[lr]::
57212::$$$message_0503_0035_0003$$$::Though, it would be a waste of my time and effort if you died so quickly. I would prefer it if you survived until the end."::
57213::$$$message_0503_0036_0000$$$::"...And why is that?"[lr]::
57214::$$$message_0503_0036_0001$$$::"It's more enjoyable that way. If you live, then Rin Tohsaka and Shirou Emiya will feel anguish. I find it pleasing when more people suffer."[lr]::
57215::$$$message_0503_0036_0002$$$::The priest turns his back on her.[lr]::
57216::$$$message_0503_0036_0003$$$::He will head to the chapel next,[lr]::
57217::$$$message_0503_0036_0004$$$::not sparing a second glance for the girl hugging herself on the operating table.::
57218::$$$message_0503_0037_0000$$$::"Now, will they spare Sakura Matou, or kill her? If you are interested in their choice, then stay here.::
57219::$$$message_0503_0037_0001$$$::This building is more cheaply built than it appears. Why, one can even hear conversations in the chapel from this room."[lr]::
57220::$$$message_0503_0037_0002$$$::Suppressing a melancholy chuckle, the priest goes off to the central garden.::
57221::$$$message_0503_0038_0000$$$::"...Senpai. What should I..."[lr]::
57222::$$$message_0503_0038_0001$$$::She hugs her knees.[lr]::
57223::$$$message_0503_0038_0002$$$::The sound of the rain drowns out her quiet weeping.::
