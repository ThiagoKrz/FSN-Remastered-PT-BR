61115::$$$message_0558_0000_0000$$$::There's a time and place for complete honesty.[lr]::
61116::$$$message_0558_0000_0001$$$::Just thinking back to that dream was enough to make me blush, and if I described it out loud, I'm pretty sure I'd pass out from the ensuing fever.::
61117::$$$message_0558_0001_0000$$$::"Senpai, who was in your dream?"[lr]::
61118::$$$message_0558_0001_0001$$$::"Nobody, really! You know, people forget dreams as soon as they wake up, so it's not like I still remember everything."::
61119::$$$message_0558_0002_0000$$$::"Oh? I'm curious what you do remember, though."::
61120::$$$message_0558_0003_0000$$$::"You...!"[lr]::
61121::$$$message_0558_0003_0001$$$::Sh-she suddenly gets more aggressive, closing in on me after I've retreated from my futon.::
61122::$$$message_0558_0004_0000$$$::"H-hey, please don't get any closer! I'm begging you, this topic is off limits!!!"[lr]::
61123::$$$message_0558_0004_0001$$$::I wave my hands in the air frantically and roll on the ground.::
61124::$$$message_0558_0005_0000$$$::Damn it. I really do need to train more.[lr]::
61125::$$$message_0558_0005_0001$$$::Until now, I've always managed to not be too conscious of her, but thanks to that damn dream, every single move Sakura makes is setting me off!::
61126::$$$message_0558_0006_0000$$$::"P-please, just leave me alone for a while. Shouldn't you listen to what a sick person asks for!?"[lr]::
61127::$$$message_0558_0006_0001$$$::I take up position in a corner of the room and entreat Sakura.::
61128::$$$message_0558_0007_0000$$$::"...Whew. All right. I won't pry.[lr]::
61129::$$$message_0558_0007_0001$$$::I really am curious about your dream, but I'm afraid it would raise your fever to push you on it."[lr]::
61130::$$$message_0558_0007_0002$$$::Sakura retreats in disappointment.::
61131::$$$message_0558_0008_0000$$$::"Sorry. But thanks for being considerate."[lr]::
61132::$$$message_0558_0008_0001$$$::I eagerly return to bed.::
61133::$$$message_0558_0009_0000$$$::"Then, Senpai, I'm off to make lunch now.[lr]::
61134::$$$message_0558_0009_0001$$$::I'll come get you when it's ready, so please take it easy until then."[lr]::
61135::$$$message_0558_0009_0002$$$::"Oh, right. Thanks."::
61136::$$$message_0558_0010_0000$$$::"Of course. And I'm sorry for asking strange questions. We'll be having warm udon for lunch."[lr]::
61137::$$$message_0558_0010_0001$$$::She shuts the door with a soft thud.[lr]::
61138::$$$message_0558_0010_0002$$$::Sakura leaves me with her usual gentle smile, and heads off to the living room.::Ïf
