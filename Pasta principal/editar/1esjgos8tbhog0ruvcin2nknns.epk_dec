62919::$$$message_0579_0000_0000$$$::"Senpai, I've finished washing the turnips. How are the chicken wings doing?"[lr]::
62920::$$$message_0579_0000_0001$$$::"...Yup, just finished blanching them. Cut those into fourths, and we'll stew them."::
62921::$$$message_0579_0001_0000$$$::"Huh. Senpai, what are you doing with that curry powder?"[lr]::
62922::$$$message_0579_0001_0001$$$::"Making a sauce. I'll use it to glaze the sardines before I grill them. Illya doesn't like fish, but I bet she'll eat it if it's curry-flavored."::
62923::$$$message_0579_0002_0000$$$::"That's a great idea! Um, I'll trim the fish, so please[r]::
62924::$$$message_0579_0002_0001$$$::keep an eye on the stew."::
62925::$$$message_0579_0003_0000$$$::"Huh? Oh, that's okay, since I don't need a knife to trim sardines. I'll ask you when it's time to scrape out the bones, so use the dashi and soy sauce to braise the kabocha squash in the meantime. We should have at least one sweet dish."[lr]::
62926::$$$message_0579_0003_0001$$$::"Roger that. Oh, you look like a sushi chef trimming fish with one hand, Senpai."::
62927::$$$message_0579_0004_0000$$$::Sakura cheerfully reaches into the refrigerator.[lr]::
62928::$$$message_0579_0004_0001$$$::Maybe she feels better after a full night's sleep, because she's in a great mood this morning.::
62929::$$$message_0579_0005_0000$$$::"...Mm."[lr]::
62930::$$$message_0579_0005_0001$$$::And I'm having fun in the kitchen with her, too.[lr]::
62931::$$$message_0579_0005_0002$$$::Sakura thoughtfully anticipates what I'm trying to do and preps everything I need.[lr]::
62932::$$$message_0579_0005_0003$$$::Cooking together with her is so comforting.::
62933::$$$message_0579_0006_0000$$$::"Senpai? Sushi chef? You stopped moving."[lr]::
62934::$$$message_0579_0006_0001$$$::"Hm? Oops, spaced out for a second. We'd better hurry. It's almost seven."::
62935::$$$message_0579_0007_0000$$$::I sigh quietly so that Sakura won't hear, and resume trimming the sardines.[lr]::
62936::$$$message_0579_0007_0001$$$::Sardines have soft flesh, so it's better to trim them with fingers than a knife. It's something I can just barely manage to do with my only working hand.::
62937::$$$message_0579_0008_0000$$$::"When did you learn that skill? I don't think it's very common to trim fish with only your right hand."[lr]::
62938::$$$message_0579_0008_0001$$$::"It isn't a skill. I'm just doing the best I can with what I got. You could learn to do it too."::
62939::$$$message_0579_0009_0000$$$::"Huh. That's all?"[lr]::
62940::$$$message_0579_0009_0001$$$::"That's all. When people say kitchen skills, they mean stuff like ice carving or butchering a cow with a single knife.[lr]::
62941::$$$message_0579_0009_0002$$$::There, you can handle the rest. We'll grill them after you debone them, so put them in a bowl."::
62942::$$$message_0579_0010_0000$$$::I step away from the cutting board and move in front of the stove.[lr]::
62943::$$$message_0579_0010_0001$$$::I turn on the heat under the frying pan, and add half a teaspoon of oil.[lr]::
62944::$$$message_0579_0010_0002$$$::I'm more or less on autopilot thanks to muscle memory, so I start looking up at the sky.::
62945::$$$message_0579_0011_0000$$$::"Um, Senpai?"[lr]::
62946::$$$message_0579_0011_0001$$$::"Mm."[lr]::
62947::$$$message_0579_0011_0002$$$::I grunt absently.::
62948::$$$message_0579_0012_0000$$$::"...This might not be any of my business, but did something happen with Illya?"[lr]::
62949::$$$message_0579_0012_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
62950::$$$message_0579_0012_0002$$$::My hand holding the pan freezes.[lr]::
62951::$$$message_0579_0012_0003$$$::But only for an instant.[lr]::
62952::$$$message_0579_0012_0004$$$::Sakura probably didn't notice.::
62953::$$$message_0579_0013_0000$$$::"Yeah, a little. We talked before I came to the kitchen. Illya is who she is, and this isn't easy for me. I have no idea how I'm supposed to deal with her."[lr]::
62954::$$$message_0579_0013_0001$$$::"...As a Master, you mean?[lr]::
62955::$$$message_0579_0013_0002$$$::Did Illya say she's going to keep fighting, or something like that?"::
62956::$$$message_0579_0014_0000$$$::"Nah. She doesn't seem like she wants to fight right now... Or maybe she never wanted to, to begin with. She was trying to get the Holy Grail as the Einzbern Master, but she has another goal aside from that.[lr]::
62957::$$$message_0579_0014_0001$$$::But..."::
62958::$$$message_0579_0015_0000$$$::...She lost it long before this war ever started.[lr]::
62959::$$$message_0579_0015_0001$$$::The person she wanted to see, Kiritsugu Emiya,[lr]::
62960::$$$message_0579_0015_0002$$$::died five years ago.[lr]::
62961::$$$message_0579_0015_0003$$$::So...what can I do for her in his place? What should I do?::
62962::$$$message_0579_0016_0000$$$::"Hey, Sakura. If Illya says that she doesn't want to go back to her country, can she live here with us?"::
62963::$$$message_0579_0017_0000$$$::"Uh...um. This is your house, Senpai. My opinion doesn't really matter."[lr]::
62964::$$$message_0579_0017_0001$$$::"What are you talking about? This is your house, too. I'd definitely need to consult my partner before letting in a new housemate."::
62965::$$$message_0579_0018_0000$$$::"A-am I your partner!?"[lr]::
62966::$$$message_0579_0018_0001$$$::"Yeah. Who else?"[lr]::
62967::$$$message_0579_0018_0002$$$::Illya or Tohsaka would never help me so perfectly in the kitchen.::
62968::$$$message_0579_0019_0000$$$::"Sakura, the pan's ready."[lr]::
62969::$$$message_0579_0019_0001$$$::I ask her for the deboned sardines.[lr]::
62970::$$$message_0579_0019_0002$$$::Sakura gives them to me with an unsteady motion.[lr]::
62971::$$$message_0579_0019_0003$$$::...?[lr]::
62972::$$$message_0579_0019_0004$$$::What's wrong?[lr]::
62973::$$$message_0579_0019_0005$$$::Is her fever back?::
62974::$$$message_0579_0020_0000$$$::"R-right, got it! I'll do my best to get along with Illya!"[lr]::
62975::$$$message_0579_0020_0001$$$::"...Yeah, I'd be happy to see that. Illya says she doesn't dislike you, so I bet you'd get along if you talked."::
62976::$$$message_0579_0021_0000$$$::...Yeah. That would make me really happy.[lr]::
62977::$$$message_0579_0021_0001$$$::Once the Holy Grail War and our relationship as Masters ends, I'd love to have Sakura and Illya live here. We can make breakfast together without a care in the world, just like today.[lr]::
62978::$$$message_0579_0021_0002$$$::I'd pay any price to make that happy future come true.::
62979::$$$message_0579_0022_0000$$$::"Morning. You two are up early for a Sunday."[lr]::
62980::$$$message_0579_0022_0001$$$::Suddenly, an incredible sight[lr]::
62981::$$$message_0579_0022_0002$$$::walks by.::
62982::$$$message_0579_0023_0000$$$::"S-Senpai, did you just see a strange person walk by?"[lr]::
62983::$$$message_0579_0023_0001$$$::"...Well, if you saw it too, then I guess I’m not hallucinating."[lr]::
62984::$$$message_0579_0023_0002$$$::We timidly peek into the living room.::
62985::$$$message_0579_0024_0000$$$::With a loud thump, the newcomer violently plants herself on the floor to stake her territory. Then, she grumpily pours herself a cup of tea, and turns on the TV with a sour expression.::
62986::$$$message_0579_0025_0000$$$::"Wow. So Tohsaka-senpai isn't a morning person..."[lr]::
62987::$$$message_0579_0025_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
62988::$$$message_0579_0025_0002$$$::Um, Sakura.[lr]::
62989::$$$message_0579_0025_0003$$$::Isn't that term usually reserved for more endearing behavior?::
62990::$$$message_0579_0026_0000$$$::We start eating breakfast.[lr]::
62991::$$$message_0579_0026_0001$$$::I'm sitting next to Sakura at the dining table, while Tohsaka is next to Illya.::
62992::$$$message_0579_0027_0000$$$::"Oh. This is seasoned so tastefully, Sakura. I suppose I'll eat this."[lr]::
62993::$$$message_0579_0027_0001$$$::I can't tell if Illya's praising or attacking her.::
62994::$$$message_0579_0028_0000$$$::"All right, I lose. I don't normally eat breakfast, though."[lr]::
62995::$$$message_0579_0028_0001$$$::In classic Tohsaka fashion, she grumbles even as she munches on the tamagoyaki.[lr]::
62996::$$$message_0579_0028_0002$$$::"Mm."[lr]::
62997::$$$message_0579_0028_0003$$$::One grunt, and she focuses on her food without saying anything else.::
62998::$$$message_0579_0029_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
62999::$$$message_0579_0029_0001$$$::Breakfast passes in silence.[lr]::
63000::$$$message_0579_0029_0002$$$::The only noise comes from the TV as it alternates through topic after topic.::
63001::$$$message_0579_0030_0000$$$::"Hm...?"[lr]::
63002::$$$message_0579_0030_0001$$$::   I see a familiar backdrop on the screen.[lr]::
63003::$$$message_0579_0030_0002$$$::There's no doubt about it.[lr]::
63004::$$$message_0579_0030_0003$$$::They're talking about mysterious bloodstains found this morning in the Shinto park.::
63005::$$$message_0579_0031_0000$$$::"Missing people in the central park... Large numbers of bloodstains in the vicinity...?"::
63006::$$$message_0579_0032_0000$$$::It was a rather graphic incident.[lr]::
63007::$$$message_0579_0032_0001$$$::An older man out on a morning run found bloodstains at the park and reported them.[lr]::
63008::$$$message_0579_0032_0002$$$::Police officers responding to the scene discovered enough spilled blood to account for a single person, as well as partial human remains.[lr]::
63009::$$$message_0579_0032_0003$$$::...Apparently, there were enough remains for up to four victims.::
63010::$$$message_0579_0033_0000$$$::"Police are looking into the background of four... Wait, why four victims? I thought they only found enough blood for one."::
63011::$$$message_0579_0034_0000$$$::"Because the body parts pointed to that many people, probably.[lr]::
63012::$$$message_0579_0034_0001$$$::Even if they only found parts of the bodies, they could figure out that much."::
63013::$$$message_0579_0035_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka.[lr]::
63014::$$$message_0579_0035_0001$$$::Do you think a Servant[line2]that Zouken did this?"[lr]::
63015::$$$message_0579_0035_0002$$$::"Maybe. I don't know whether Zouken was responsible, but the Shadow definitely did it. Look at the edge of the video. The plants are all black and withered, just like when it showed up in the forest."::
63016::$$$message_0579_0036_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
63017::$$$message_0579_0036_0001$$$::Tohsaka analyzes it casually.[lr]::
63018::$$$message_0579_0036_0002$$$::But there's still two things I don't understand.::
63019::$$$message_0579_0037_0000$$$::"But why? It's never done anything like this before. Even if it was taking magical energy from the people in town, it never, um..."[lr]::
63020::$$$message_0579_0037_0001$$$::It didn't need to murder them like this.::
63021::$$$message_0579_0038_0000$$$::"...Yeah. If I had to come up with a reason, it could be because it doesn't have any enemies to oppose it anymore. There aren't any Masters left that can beat it in a straight fight. Now it can just do whatever it wants without worrying about being watched, right?"[lr]::
63022::$$$message_0579_0038_0001$$$::"...You mean he's just killing discriminately now?"::
63023::$$$message_0579_0039_0000$$$::"Maybe. But personally, it doesn't seem that way. Even if Zouken and the Shadow are connected, I think this might have been an unforseen accident.[lr]::
63024::$$$message_0579_0039_0001$$$::I'll bet you a tamagoyaki that this came as a surprise to Zouken."::
63025::$$$message_0579_0040_0000$$$::...Not that Tohsaka even has any tamagoyaki left to hold up her end of the bet.[lr]::
63026::$$$message_0579_0040_0001$$$::And now, her eagle eyes are eyeing my plate.::
63027::$$$message_0579_0041_0000$$$::"...Why do you think it was an accident?"[lr]::
63028::$$$message_0579_0041_0001$$$::"Because he can't clean this up. There's the bloodstains, but Zouken wouldn't have left bodies at the scene. Which means that Zouken wasn't there while that spooky Shadow was having a meal."::
63029::$$$message_0579_0042_0000$$$::"I see... One more question. How do they know that there are four victims? There's only enough blood for one, and they said that they only found enough body parts to make up one person."::
63030::$$$message_0579_0043_0000$$$::"It's not body mass, but shape. What if they found four body parts that each person can only possess one of? You can count those to figure out how many victims there are.[lr]::
63031::$$$message_0579_0043_0001$$$::Think about it. If you found four left shoes in a pool of blood, how many people would that add up to?"::
63032::$$$message_0579_0044_0000$$$::Tohsaka talks about it calmly.[lr]::
63033::$$$message_0579_0044_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
63034::$$$message_0579_0044_0002$$$::As soon as I imagine that visual, my appetite suddenly goes away.::
