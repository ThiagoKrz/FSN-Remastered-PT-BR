10807::$$$message_0110_0000_0000$$$::"What the hell is that!?"[lr]::
10808::$$$message_0110_0000_0001$$$::When I reach Ryudou Temple, I'm greeted by the sound of air rushing at me like a typhoon.::
10809::$$$message_0110_0001_0000$$$::"That must be...Saber over there."[lr]::
10810::$$$message_0110_0001_0001$$$::At the top of the stairs, in front of the temple gates, I see an armored figure who must be Saber fighting someone wearing a kimono.[lr]::
10811::$$$message_0110_0001_0002$$$::The wind swirls around Saber, and the surrounding trees creak under the gale force intensity.::
10812::$$$message_0110_0002_0000$$$::"Wait...damn...I don't think I can get close!"[lr]::
10813::$$$message_0110_0002_0001$$$::The wind is so intense, I can't even keep my eyes open.[lr]::
10814::$$$message_0110_0002_0002$$$::Head down, I manage to fight my way closer to the stairs, but the wind only gets stronger.::
10815::$$$message_0110_0003_0000$$$::"I can't...at this rate[line2]"[lr]::
10816::$$$message_0110_0003_0001$$$::I can't get closer to Saber.[lr]::
10817::$$$message_0110_0003_0002$$$::Far ahead, I can see Saber fighting someone, but I can't do anything.::
10818::$$$message_0110_0004_0000$$$::No, even if I manage to get closer to Saber in this wind, I'll only hold her back...[lr]::
10819::$$$message_0110_0004_0001$$$::"...Ng!"[lr]::
10820::$$$message_0110_0004_0002$$$::My left hand hurts again.::
10821::$$$message_0110_0005_0000$$$::The Command Spells engraved on the back of my hand tingle.[lr]::
10822::$$$message_0110_0005_0001$$$::I don't know what that means.[lr]::
10823::$$$message_0110_0005_0002$$$::But every time my hand tingles...[lr]::
10824::$$$message_0110_0005_0003$$$::I can't help but to remember that scene...!::
10825::$$$message_0110_0006_0000$$$::"Dammit!!! Screw this!!!"[lr]::
10826::$$$message_0110_0006_0001$$$::I close my eyes and stretch my hands towards the stairs.[lr]::
10827::$$$message_0110_0006_0002$$$::I get down onto my hands and knees, hoping to avoid being blown off my feet, and begin crawling up the stairs.::
10828::$$$message_0110_0007_0000$$$::"...Ugn!"[lr]::
10829::$$$message_0110_0007_0001$$$::The wind intensifies.[lr]::
10830::$$$message_0110_0007_0002$$$::Even a novice mage like me can tell [font italic=true]incredible[font italic=false] amounts of magical energy are raging above me.::
10831::$$$message_0110_0008_0000$$$::My Command Spells tingle.[lr]::
10832::$$$message_0110_0008_0001$$$::The roar of the wind warns me something is happening up above.::
10833::$$$message_0110_0009_0000$$$::"Wait...could this be..."[lr]::
10834::$$$message_0110_0009_0001$$$::Saber's magical energy?[lr]::
10835::$$$message_0110_0009_0002$$$::If it is...::
10836::$$$message_0110_0010_0000$$$::"Why would she do something so reckless in her state!?"[lr]::
10837::$$$message_0110_0010_0001$$$::No...should she even be doing something like that?[lr]::
10838::$$$message_0110_0010_0002$$$::Saber can't recover magical energy.[lr]::
10839::$$$message_0110_0010_0003$$$::She shouldn't be wasting it like this.[lr]::
10840::$$$message_0110_0010_0004$$$::I need to step in and handle the fighting and have Saber support me instead...or else she might run out of magical energy...::
10841::$$$message_0110_0011_0000$$$::"...Hngh!"[lr]::
10842::$$$message_0110_0011_0001$$$::I stand up and start running up the stairs.[lr]::
10843::$$$message_0110_0011_0002$$$::Now's not the time to be crawling.[lr]::
10844::$$$message_0110_0011_0003$$$::I don't know what Saber has in mind, but I have to stop her.::
10845::$$$message_0110_0012_0000$$$::"Huh!?"[lr]::
10846::$$$message_0110_0012_0001$$$::As I try to dash to the temple gate, something like a dagger flies right by me.[lr]::
10847::$$$message_0110_0012_0002$$$::I don't know what miracle let me dodge it.::
10848::$$$message_0110_0013_0000$$$::"Who's there!?"[lr]::
10849::$$$message_0110_0013_0001$$$::I turn to look away from the stairs, into the trees.[lr]::
10850::$$$message_0110_0013_0002$$$::There's no doubt about it.[lr]::
10851::$$$message_0110_0013_0003$$$::I didn't notice it in this torrential wind, but there's someone hiding nearby!::
10852::$$$message_0110_0014_0000$$$::"You coward! Quit hiding and come out!"[lr]::
10853::$$$message_0110_0014_0001$$$::I shout for whoever is hiding in the tree line.[lr]::
10854::$$$message_0110_0014_0002$$$::The strong winds should have drowned my voice out.[lr]::
10855::$$$message_0110_0014_0003$$$::To my surprise, my voice echoes up the stairs.::
10856::$$$message_0110_0015_0000$$$::"...The wind...died down?"[lr]::
10857::$$$message_0110_0015_0001$$$::I look up towards the temple gate.[lr]::
10858::$$$message_0110_0015_0002$$$::There...[lr]::
10859::$$$message_0110_0015_0003$$$::I see a man in a kimono wielding a long sword, and Saber's back.::
10860::$$$message_0110_0016_0000$$$::"That's enough, Saber. Someone's trying to steal a glance at your secret sword."[lr]::
10861::$$$message_0110_0016_0001$$$::The man in the kimono smiles as he speaks.[lr]::
10862::$$$message_0110_0016_0002$$$::Like me, he's staring out into the forest.::
10863::$$$message_0110_0017_0000$$$::"If we continue, neither of us will emerge victorious.[lr]::
10864::$$$message_0110_0017_0001$$$::Whoever hides so cravenly in the trees may attack whoever survives our duel. Or they may simply be observing hoping to learn about your hidden blade.[lr]::
10865::$$$message_0110_0017_0002$$$::In either case, I do not care to involve myself."::
10866::$$$message_0110_0018_0000$$$::The man turns to climb the stairs, seeming totally disinterested.[lr]::
10867::$$$message_0110_0018_0001$$$::"Stop! Do you not intend to settle our match, Assassin!?"::
10868::$$$message_0110_0019_0000$$$::"Should you attempt to pass through the temple gates once again, we shall settle things. I will not allow any to pass this gate, no matter who they may be.[lr]::
10869::$$$message_0110_0019_0001$$$::That, unfortunately, is my only role.[lr]::
10870::$$$message_0110_0019_0002$$$::If you plan on turning back, I have no intention of stopping you. That fool hiding in the trees, though, is another matter. Should I find myself disliking them, I will not allow them in, even dead, nor will I let them leave alive."[lr]::
10871::$$$message_0110_0019_0003$$$::Assassin continues up the stairs.::
10872::$$$message_0110_0020_0000$$$::"You were manipulated, Saber. But the same goes for me, as I did not notice whoever is lurking in the shadows. Had we continued, I could have shown you the power of my secret technique. But we were interrupted. You should consider yourself fortunate."::
10873::$$$message_0110_0021_0000$$$::"...Ghh!"[lr]::
10874::$$$message_0110_0021_0001$$$::Saber hangs her head in regret.[lr]::
10875::$$$message_0110_0021_0002$$$::Her intent to kill fades.[lr]::
10876::$$$message_0110_0021_0003$$$::Not because of Assassin's words, but because Saber must have realized that keeping up the fight would leave her at a disadvantage.::
10877::$$$message_0110_0022_0000$$$::"Come now, your escort's here too. That boy over there must be your Master. I suggest you leave this place before the fool spying on us decides to target him."[lr]::
10878::$$$message_0110_0022_0001$$$::And just like that, Assassin disappears.[lr]::
10879::$$$message_0110_0022_0002$$$::It must be his way of telling us that he won't attack unless we keep going.::
10880::$$$message_0110_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
10881::$$$message_0110_0023_0001$$$::Saber says nothing.[lr]::
10882::$$$message_0110_0023_0002$$$::She just stands there silently, her back to me.::
10883::$$$message_0110_0024_0000$$$::"...Hey, Saber?"[lr]::
10884::$$$message_0110_0024_0001$$$::Even when I call to her, she doesn't answer.[lr]::
10885::$$$message_0110_0024_0002$$$::"Huh?"[lr]::
10886::$$$message_0110_0024_0003$$$::It seems strange, so I begin climbing the steps.::
10887::$$$message_0110_0025_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
10888::$$$message_0110_0025_0001$$$::Saber's armor vanishes.[lr]::
10889::$$$message_0110_0025_0002$$$::Defenseless and in her simple blue clothing, she sways on the spot without turning around.::
10890::$$$message_0110_0026_0000$$$::"...Ah!"[lr]::
10891::$$$message_0110_0026_0001$$$::I catch Saber in my arms as she falls backward down the stairs.[lr]::
10892::$$$message_0110_0026_0002$$$::She doesn't move a muscle; she's unconscious, eyes shut in pain.::
10893::$$$message_0110_0027_0000$$$::"Ha...ah...haaah...hah..."[lr]::
10894::$$$message_0110_0027_0001$$$::...We finally get home.[lr]::
10895::$$$message_0110_0027_0002$$$::It took me two hours to carry Saber back from Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
10896::$$$message_0110_0027_0003$$$::I was worried the whole return trip, but we managed to get back safely.::
10897::$$$message_0110_0028_0000$$$::"...Haaa...ah...haaa..."[lr]::
10898::$$$message_0110_0028_0001$$$::I lay Saber down in the hallway.[lr]::
10899::$$$message_0110_0028_0002$$$::Saber was really light. She probably only weighs about forty kilos, so it shouldn't have tired me out so much.::
10900::$$$message_0110_0029_0000$$$::Or it wouldn't have, if she'd been still.[lr]::
10901::$$$message_0110_0029_0001$$$::I had no idea that carrying a sleeping person, even a girl, could be so much work.[lr]::
10902::$$$message_0110_0029_0002$$$::My fatigue is more mental than physical.[lr]::
10903::$$$message_0110_0029_0003$$$::The feel of her soft skin when I picked her up, her quiet breathing on me...it was all so distracting.::
10904::$$$message_0110_0030_0000$$$::"Why'd she just faint like that?"[lr]::
10905::$$$message_0110_0030_0001$$$::I look at Saber as she lays there sleeping.[lr]::
10906::$$$message_0110_0030_0002$$$::She's probably not completely unconscious.[lr]::
10907::$$$message_0110_0030_0003$$$::Even if she looks like she's out cold, she might open her eyes the moment I call her name.::
10908::$$$message_0110_0031_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
10909::$$$message_0110_0031_0001$$$::...Damn.[lr]::
10910::$$$message_0110_0031_0002$$$::There was so much I wanted to tell her when I left the house, but I can't say anything with her sleeping...looking like that.::
10911::$$$message_0110_0032_0000$$$::"Fine. I'll give you an earful after you wake up, Saber."[lr]::
10912::$$$message_0110_0032_0001$$$::Even now, I keep my voice to a whisper.[lr]::
10913::$$$message_0110_0032_0002$$$::The moment I reach out to pick her up again...::
10914::$$$message_0110_0033_0000$$$::"Look, I don't care what you're into or what you plan on doing next. It's really not my business. But..."[lr]::
10915::$$$message_0110_0033_0001$$$::For some reason...[lr]::
10916::$$$message_0110_0033_0002$$$::Tohsaka is in the hallway, watching, even though it's after two in the morning.::
10917::$$$message_0110_0034_0000$$$::"T-T-T-T-T-T-T-Tohsaka!?"[lr]::
10918::$$$message_0110_0034_0001$$$::"What? You look like you just saw a ghost. I'm not going to say anything, so you just go ahead and do...whatever you were going to do. I just got up to get a glass of water."::
10919::$$$message_0110_0035_0000$$$::"Eh...ah! You've got it all wrong! This isn't what you think! Really!"[lr]::
10920::$$$message_0110_0035_0001$$$::I mean, it's a long story, but the short version is that I was just trying to take Saber back to her room[line2]Are you even listening to me!?"::
10921::$$$message_0110_0036_0000$$$::"Well, yes. Sort of."[lr]::
10922::$$$message_0110_0036_0001$$$::"Ugh...you're lying! You sound like you don't understand at all!"::
10923::$$$message_0110_0037_0000$$$::"I got it, okay? Saber went out to fight on her own, and you rushed off to stop her, right?[lr]::
10924::$$$message_0110_0037_0001$$$::Something bad happened, then you both came back after Saber fainted. So, did I nail it?"::
10925::$$$message_0110_0038_0000$$$::"Uh...yeah. That's amazing. That's exactly what happened. But how did you know?"::
10926::$$$message_0110_0039_0000$$$::"How could I not? Saber was obviously going to go off on her own, and a Master is immediately alerted to a Servant entering battle. It wasn't hard to figure out."::
10927::$$$message_0110_0040_0000$$$::"...I see. I guess that's fine, then."[lr]::
10928::$$$message_0110_0040_0001$$$::So Tohsaka knew Saber would go out by herself.::
10929::$$$message_0110_0041_0000$$$::"So what are you going to do? Aren't you going to take Saber to her room? If you let her sleep here, I'm sure even a Servant would catch a cold."::
10930::$$$message_0110_0042_0000$$$::"Well yeah, that's why I was going to take her to her room..."[lr]::
10931::$$$message_0110_0042_0001$$$::I try to lift her up but...[lr]::
10932::$$$message_0110_0042_0002$$$::Erm...[lr]::
10933::$$$message_0110_0042_0003$$$::It's kind of awkward with Tohsaka watching.::
10934::$$$message_0110_0043_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. Would you mind carrying Saber?"[lr]::
10935::$$$message_0110_0043_0001$$$::"Me? I mean, I guess, but would you make some tea then? I want to hear what happened."::
10936::$$$message_0110_0044_0000$$$::Tohsaka picks Saber up.[lr]::
10937::$$$message_0110_0044_0001$$$::Her being so understanding has me a little worried, but since I asked her for a favor, I'd better go make some tea.::
10938::$$$message_0110_0045_0000$$$::Tohsaka carries Saber off toward my room.[lr]::
10939::$$$message_0110_0045_0001$$$::Meanwhile, I work on preparing tea in the kitchen.::
10940::$$$message_0110_0046_0000$$$::"She said tea, but I'm assuming she doesn't want green tea. But the only black tea I have is from tea bags."[lr]::
10941::$$$message_0110_0046_0001$$$::Well, if I don't have it, I don't have it.[lr]::
10942::$$$message_0110_0046_0002$$$::I tell myself she can complain all she wants, and start pouring the hot water over the bag.::
10943::$$$message_0110_0047_0000$$$::"Shirou, do you have a minute?"[lr]::
10944::$$$message_0110_0047_0001$$$::Tohsaka comes back.[lr]::
10945::$$$message_0110_0047_0002$$$::"Yeah, hold on a minute I'll be right there."[lr]::
10946::$$$message_0110_0047_0003$$$::I put two tea cups on the tray and carry it out to the living room.[lr]::
10947::$$$message_0110_0047_0004$$$::And there...[lr]::
10948::$$$message_0110_0047_0005$$$::...sitting next to Tohsaka, is Saber in her normal clothes.::
10949::$$$message_0110_0048_0000$$$::"S-Saber!? Why? I thought you were asleep...!?"::
10950::$$$message_0110_0049_0000$$$::"She was. But it's not like she was going to sleep forever. She woke up.[lr]::
10951::$$$message_0110_0049_0001$$$::Looks like she used a ton of magical energy at once, and just temporarily shut down. It's kind of like an electrical breaker tripping before it shorts out."::
10952::$$$message_0110_0050_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
10953::$$$message_0110_0050_0001$$$::Saber is quiet as Tohsaka explains.[lr]::
10954::$$$message_0110_0050_0002$$$::"Y-you..."[lr]::
10955::$$$message_0110_0050_0003$$$::Seeing her back to her usual self, all the frustrations I had earlier come rushing back.::
10956::$$$message_0110_0051_0000$$$::"Saber, do you have any idea what you tried to do!?"::
10957::$$$message_0110_0052_0000$$$::"Of course I do.[lr]::
10958::$$$message_0110_0052_0001$$$::I made my way to Ryudou Temple and fought Assassin. During our battle, we noticed the presence of a third Servant observing us, and so suspended our battle."::
10959::$$$message_0110_0053_0000$$$::"...Ngh! No! That's not what I'm talking about![lr]::
10960::$$$message_0110_0053_0001$$$::I want to know why you went and fought!"[lr]::
10961::$$$message_0110_0053_0002$$$::"Are we to revisit this once again? A Servant fights. It is what we do. What I would like to know is why you, my Master, keep telling me not to fight."::
10962::$$$message_0110_0054_0000$$$::"Well, that, I..."[lr]::
10963::$$$message_0110_0054_0001$$$::I do understand there's no way around fighting since I've decided to participate in the Holy Grail War.[lr]::
10964::$$$message_0110_0054_0002$$$::And I know me telling Saber not to fight is me contradicting myself.[lr]::
10965::$$$message_0110_0054_0003$$$::But. Even so...[lr]::
10966::$$$message_0110_0054_0004$$$::I don't want to see something like...[font italic=true]that[font italic=false] happen to her ever again.::
10967::$$$message_0110_0055_0000$$$::"I would like to ask you instead. You seem to dislike combat. Do you truly expect to survive the Holy Grail War with that attitude?[lr]::
10968::$$$message_0110_0055_0001$$$::Do you not see that if we continue to follow this policy, we will only end up suffering defeat at the hands of the other Masters?"::
10969::$$$message_0110_0056_0000$$$::It's not like that.[lr]::
10970::$$$message_0110_0056_0001$$$::I'll fight off anything that might pose a risk to us. I certainly don't intend to just let myself be killed so easily.[lr]::
10971::$$$message_0110_0056_0002$$$::But aside from that, I just don't want Saber to fight.::
10972::$$$message_0110_0057_0000$$$::"Wrong...[lr]::
10973::$$$message_0110_0057_0001$$$::It's not that I dislike fighting. I just, um..."[lr]::
10974::$$$message_0110_0057_0002$$$::This is much simpler than that.[lr]::
10975::$$$message_0110_0057_0003$$$::I...::
10976::$$$message_0110_0058_0000$$$::"You see, girls shouldn't get hurt. I'm a guy, so I can't let that happen. So, I'm going to fight rather than let you fight."[lr]::
10977::$$$message_0110_0058_0001$$$::"What!? Are you saying I cannot fight because I'm a woman!?"::
10978::$$$message_0110_0059_0000$$$::"Are you out of your mind? A Servant protects her Master! We [font italic=true]will[font italic=false] be hurt in the doing, and are summoned for that precise purpose.[lr]::
10979::$$$message_0110_0059_0001$$$::One's sex has nothing to do with being a Servant. More importantly, are you treating me as a warrior, or as a woman!?[lr]::
10980::$$$message_0110_0059_0002$$$::I insist you take back what you have said, Shirou. Please!"::
10981::$$$message_0110_0060_0000$$$::Saber leans toward me, her eyes blazing with fury.[lr]::
10982::$$$message_0110_0060_0001$$$::But I won't let her change my mind.[lr]::
10983::$$$message_0110_0060_0002$$$::It's absurd for her to say she's a warrior before she's a woman.[lr]::
10984::$$$message_0110_0060_0003$$$::How could someone so frail[line2]light enough for me to carry easily[line2]go and behave so recklessly!?::
10985::$$$message_0110_0061_0000$$$::"No way in hell will I take back what I said! Sure, you might be strong, but you're still a girl! Don't get worked up over something so pointless, you fool!"::
10986::$$$message_0110_0062_0000$$$::"What!? It is you who are getting worked up over something pointless! Are you saying you refuse to let a woman protect you? I am already a Heroic Spirit, so you must let go of such trivialities!"::
10987::$$$message_0110_0063_0000$$$::"It's not trivial at all! Argh! Even if you don't think it's important, I [font italic=true]do[font italic=false]! Besides, it was a mistake from the beginning to have someone else fight on my behalf. I can't..."::
10988::$$$message_0110_0064_0000$$$::I can't allow someone to protect someone as helpless as me.[lr]::
10989::$$$message_0110_0064_0001$$$::I don't want someone to get hurt in my place.[lr]::
10990::$$$message_0110_0064_0002$$$::I'm the one who should be doing the saving.[lr]::
10991::$$$message_0110_0064_0003$$$::I've been working so hard to become the kind of person who can help people, just like my old man...::
10992::$$$message_0110_0065_0000$$$::"Dammit. Listen. Just don't fight, Saber.[lr]::
10993::$$$message_0110_0065_0001$$$::I'll do the fighting. You shouldn't have a problem with that, since it'll be the fighting you want, Saber."::
10994::$$$message_0110_0066_0000$$$::"What!? That is absurd! Do you think a human can fight a Servant!? You should already understand that you are no match for a Servant![lr]::
10995::$$$message_0110_0066_0001$$$::Please recall what happened when Lancer attacked you.[lr]::
10996::$$$message_0110_0066_0002$$$::Had I not appeared, you would have been killed. So it would be against any Servant!"::
10997::$$$message_0110_0067_0000$$$::"Y-you can't know that for sure unless we try! I just wasn't prepared. But now I can come up with tons of strategies! I might even be able to ambush one of them too!"::
10998::$$$message_0110_0068_0000$$$::"Do not make me laugh. Any defense you employ would be no more useful than a sheaf of paper."[lr]::
10999::$$$message_0110_0068_0001$$$::"Wha...! I can't believe you'd say that, Saber!"::
11000::$$$message_0110_0069_0000$$$::"You are insulting Servants. How can you possibly be so conceited as to believe that you, a mere human, could defeat a Heroic Spirit?"[lr]::
11001::$$$message_0110_0069_0001$$$::"Arrrgh!!!"::
11002::$$$message_0110_0070_0000$$$::Saber and I glare at each other.[lr]::
11003::$$$message_0110_0070_0001$$$::Our conversation is going nowhere, and there is no sign of reaching any kind of compromise.::
11004::$$$message_0110_0071_0000$$$::"You've got it wrong, Saber. Shirou isn't insulting Servants. This isn't going anywhere so long as you don't understand that much, so I'm stepping in."[lr]::
11005::$$$message_0110_0071_0001$$$::"Rin? What do you mean by that?"::
11006::$$$message_0110_0072_0000$$$::"Well you see, Shirou genuinely doesn't want you to get hurt. I don't know why, but Shirou is just a giant ball of dedication and goodwill.[lr]::
11007::$$$message_0110_0072_0001$$$::Am I right? Saber is more important to you than yourself, right?"::
11008::$$$message_0110_0073_0000$$$::"Th-that's not true...! I never said Saber is important to me!"::
11009::$$$message_0110_0074_0000$$$::"Spare me. You wouldn't be ready to fight yourself if that weren't true.[lr]::
11010::$$$message_0110_0074_0001$$$::You know damn well you can't beat a Servant, right? But saying you'll fight even so means Saber is more important to you than yourself."::
11011::$$$message_0110_0075_0000$$$::"Eh...?"[lr]::
11012::$$$message_0110_0075_0001$$$::Uh...argh...[lr]::
11013::$$$message_0110_0075_0002$$$::I mean, if she puts it like that, maybe...but...::
11014::$$$message_0110_0076_0000$$$::"That's why you'll fight even if it sounds absurd. You'll try to win even if you know you don't have a chance, and you don't care if you die in the process.[lr]::
11015::$$$message_0110_0076_0001$$$::Because, and I don't really know why, in that twisted little mind of yours, other people are more important than you are yourself."::
11016::$$$message_0110_0077_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
11017::$$$message_0110_0077_0001$$$::Well...[lr]::
11018::$$$message_0110_0077_0002$$$::I don't mean it to be like that...::
11019::$$$message_0110_0078_0000$$$::"So there you have it. Now you understand, Saber. He's enough of an idiot that he'd even try to protect you against Berserker. So yeah, he's serious when he says he's going to fight."::
11020::$$$message_0110_0079_0000$$$::I don't know how much of Tohsaka's words actually make it through to Saber.[lr]::
11021::$$$message_0110_0079_0001$$$::But Saber takes a deep breath and turns toward me.::
11022::$$$message_0110_0080_0000$$$::"Shirou."[lr]::
11023::$$$message_0110_0080_0001$$$::"Wh-what, Saber?"[lr]::
11024::$$$message_0110_0080_0002$$$::"I acknowledge that you have the will to fight. And as such, I have an idea."[lr]::
11025::$$$message_0110_0080_0003$$$::"Wh-what is it?"::
11026::$$$message_0110_0081_0000$$$::"You must train with the sword. I shall teach you as much swordsmanship as time permits. If you accept that condition, then I shall accept your way of thinking."::
11027::$$$message_0110_0082_0000$$$::"What...?"[lr]::
11028::$$$message_0110_0082_0001$$$::Does that mean she's going to train me?[lr]::
11029::$$$message_0110_0082_0002$$$::Is this because she's acknowledged my will to fight?::
11030::$$$message_0110_0083_0000$$$::"Hold up, Saber. That whole line of thinking is pointless, like emotional flab.[lr]::
11031::$$$message_0110_0083_0001$$$::Teach Shirou the way of the sword? There's no way he'll be able to go up against a Servant."::
11032::$$$message_0110_0084_0000$$$::"True. But it is better than doing nothing.[lr]::
11033::$$$message_0110_0084_0001$$$::At the very least, it should minimize the hesitation he has in battle.[lr]::
11034::$$$message_0110_0084_0002$$$::I can only bet on Shirou's will and determination, but such is the nature of a real battle. One will never learn if they have no aptitude for it to begin with."::
11035::$$$message_0110_0085_0000$$$::"Hmmm. Well I guess, if you put it that way, you're right...[lr]::
11036::$$$message_0110_0085_0001$$$::You're never ready for a fistfight unless you've actually experienced one in the past."::
11037::$$$message_0110_0086_0000$$$::"Yes. That is why I would like to try once...nay, as many times as time allows. I would like Shirou to experience what death in battle feels like so he might grow accustomed to battle."[lr]::
11038::$$$message_0110_0086_0001$$$::The two of them are talking pretty casually about some scary stuff.::
11039::$$$message_0110_0087_0000$$$::"Hold on a minute. I never agreed to any[line2]"::
11040::$$$message_0110_0088_0000$$$::"Okay, then. I'll teach him about magecraft.[lr]::
11041::$$$message_0110_0088_0001$$$::If Saber's going to train his body, I'll enrich his mind. Well, that was part of our initial plan anyway, so I guess I'll begin the formal training tomorrow."::
11042::$$$message_0110_0089_0000$$$::"Yes, please do so. If you can do that, I can concentrate on training him with the sword."::
11043::$$$message_0110_0090_0000$$$::"Good, good. Now that's settled, let's break for tonight. Looks like tomorrow's going to be busy."[lr]::
11044::$$$message_0110_0090_0001$$$::Tohsaka waves goodbye and disappears into the outbuilding.::
11045::$$$message_0110_0091_0000$$$::"I shall rest as well. You should do the same, Shirou. I intend to work you hard in the dojo tomorrow."[lr]::
11046::$$$message_0110_0091_0001$$$::She gives a short bow and goes back to her room.::
11047::$$$message_0110_0092_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
11048::$$$message_0110_0092_0001$$$::All that remains in the living room is two cups of untouched tea and one dumbfounded boy.[lr]::
11049::$$$message_0110_0092_0002$$$::"I never agreed to this..."[lr]::
11050::$$$message_0110_0092_0003$$$::My words go unheard.::
11051::$$$message_0110_0093_0000$$$::Anyway...[lr]::
11052::$$$message_0110_0093_0001$$$::What was already a confusing situation has grown a hell of a lot more complicated.[lr]::
11053::$$$message_0110_0093_0002$$$::I can't even begin to imagine what will happen today.::
11054::$$$message_0110_0094_0000$$$::"I'm going to sleep. I should at least save my energy."[lr]::
11055::$$$message_0110_0094_0001$$$::Everything starts with the body.[lr]::
11056::$$$message_0110_0094_0002$$$::Well, yeah...[lr]::
11057::$$$message_0110_0094_0003$$$::The only thing I can do is to cling on to my fragile hope that as long as my body is strong enough, I will be able to endure whatever torture they might throw at me...::l`
