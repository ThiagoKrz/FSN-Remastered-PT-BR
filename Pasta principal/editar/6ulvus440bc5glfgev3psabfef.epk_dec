67765::$$$message_0628_0000_0000$$$::Time is stopped.[lr]::
67766::$$$message_0628_0000_0001$$$::"...No.[lr]::
67767::$$$message_0628_0000_0002$$$::I don't want this, Berserker!"[lr]::
67768::$$$message_0628_0000_0003$$$::Illya screams a plea, but the giant doesn't know who she is.[lr]::
67769::$$$message_0628_0000_0004$$$::It swings its greatsword down at her.::
67770::$$$message_0628_0001_0000$$$::"ILLYAAAAAAA!!!"[lr]::
67771::$$$message_0628_0001_0001$$$::I run.[lr]::
67772::$$$message_0628_0001_0002$$$::I was thrown about ten meters.[lr]::
67773::$$$message_0628_0001_0003$$$::But I can cross that in an instant. I know I'll make it if I run.[lr]::
67774::$$$message_0628_0001_0004$$$::In the span of a single breath, a narcotic blood propellant will propel my body like a jet stream, and my thoughts will blaze like lightning!::
67775::$$$message_0628_0002_0000$$$::   I take a step forward.[lr]::
67776::$$$message_0628_0002_0001$$$::My body feels light. I can feel time stop.::
67777::$$$message_0628_0003_0000$$$::   I can make it.[lr]::
67778::$$$message_0628_0003_0001$$$::I know I'll make it. But once I do...::
67779::$$$message_0628_0004_0000$$$::   The Black Key had no effect. I had no effect.[lr]::
67780::$$$message_0628_0004_0001$$$::That's why...::
67781::$$$message_0628_0005_0000$$$::           I rummage through my armory, searching for something to make.[lr]::
67782::$$$message_0628_0005_0001$$$::           Something that can beat him.[lr]::
67783::$$$message_0628_0005_0002$$$::           Something that's strong enough to stop him here.::
67784::$$$message_0628_0006_0000$$$::                            How obvious.[lr]::
67785::$$$message_0628_0006_0001$$$::                            It can only be the greatsword he's holding!::
67786::$$$message_0628_0007_0000$$$::    I blocked it.[lr]::
67787::$$$message_0628_0007_0001$$$::I Project a weapon as if it comes naturally to me, and take the giant's axe-sword head-on.::
67788::$$$message_0628_0008_0000$$$::"                        Ah."[lr]::
67789::$$$message_0628_0008_0001$$$::It's cracked.[lr]::
67790::$$$message_0628_0008_0002$$$::Fissures form in the axe-sword I Projected.[lr]::
67791::$$$message_0628_0008_0003$$$::At the same time...::
67792::$$$message_0628_0009_0000$$$::"[wacky len=15]!"[lr]::
67793::$$$message_0628_0009_0001$$$::"Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!"[lr]::
67794::$$$message_0628_0009_0002$$$::The feedback from using something I shouldn't have used nearly kills me.::
67795::$$$message_0628_0010_0000$$$::I'm thrown through the air.[lr]::
67796::$$$message_0628_0010_0001$$$::The axe-sword shatters against the giant's second attack, and my body tumbles along the ground like a piece of trash.::
67797::$$$message_0628_0011_0000$$$::...fading.[lr]::
67798::$$$message_0628_0011_0001$$$::My mind is fading.[lr]::
67799::$$$message_0628_0011_0002$$$::I can't think.[lr]::
67800::$$$message_0628_0011_0003$$$::I try to collect my scattered self, but I can't think.[lr]::
67801::$$$message_0628_0011_0004$$$::My left arm revolts against me.[lr]::
67802::$$$message_0628_0011_0005$$$::My blood overflows.[lr]::
67803::$$$message_0628_0011_0006$$$::The mere act of Projection, even though my left arm is still bound, halves my IQ and I feel an awful chill that tells me there's no going back. That terrible premonition will turn out to be true. The first things I'll lose will be the most precious to me.::
67804::$$$message_0628_0012_0000$$$::"...Ah."[lr]::
67805::$$$message_0628_0012_0001$$$::A tempest rages around me.[lr]::
67806::$$$message_0628_0012_0002$$$::I'm bathed in blinding light.[lr]::
67807::$$$message_0628_0012_0003$$$::I can't see. I can't find it. [lr]::
67808::$$$message_0628_0012_0004$$$::I've lost sight of it amidst the pain.[lr]::
67809::$$$message_0628_0012_0005$$$::I'm looking for it, but I can't find it.[lr]::
67810::$$$message_0628_0012_0006$$$::My ego becomes a grain of sand in the desert, never to be found by anyone ever again, and I'm thirsty thirsty thirsty thirsty...::
67811::$$$message_0628_0013_0000$$$::"Shirou! Snap out of it! You need to find yourself...!"[lr]::
67812::$$$message_0628_0013_0001$$$::Illya's here.[lr]::
67813::$$$message_0628_0013_0002$$$::I'm on the ground.[lr]::
67814::$$$message_0628_0013_0003$$$::The dark giant is about ten meters away.[lr]::
67815::$$$message_0628_0013_0004$$$::Its red eyes dazzle, as if searching for my thrown body.::
67816::$$$message_0628_0014_0000$$$::"Nnn...!"[lr]::
67817::$$$message_0628_0014_0001$$$::I return to my senses.[lr]::
67818::$$$message_0628_0014_0002$$$::This is no time to be taking a dirt nap.[lr]::
67819::$$$message_0628_0014_0003$$$::My body...my body can still move.[lr]::
67820::$$$message_0628_0014_0004$$$::My only injuries are scratches from tree branches. I'm only lightly bleeding.[lr]::
67821::$$$message_0628_0014_0005$$$::But my lungs feel tight. I gasp for air, trying to oxygenate my exhausted body.::
67822::$$$message_0628_0015_0000$$$::That's all.[lr]::
67823::$$$message_0628_0015_0001$$$::What's more important are my insides...I don't want to know what they look like, but I can still fight...!::
67824::$$$message_0628_0016_0000$$$::"Illya, we're falling back!"[lr]::
67825::$$$message_0628_0016_0001$$$::I grab Illya's hand and start running.[lr]::
67826::$$$message_0628_0016_0002$$$::Even if I'm not injured, I still need to catch my breath.[lr]::
67827::$$$message_0628_0016_0003$$$::I need to at least get out of his reach for a minute, so that I can compose myself!::
67828::$$$message_0628_0017_0000$$$::However...[lr]::
67829::$$$message_0628_0017_0001$$$::"...Why did you do that? Shirou, do you know what's happening to you?"[lr]::
67830::$$$message_0628_0017_0002$$$::Illya resists my pull.::
67831::$$$message_0628_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67832::$$$message_0628_0018_0001$$$::Something's wrong.[lr]::
67833::$$$message_0628_0018_0002$$$::Berserker is behind Illya, trying to pinpoint where we are.[lr]::
67834::$$$message_0628_0018_0003$$$::I can't think straight due to the lack of oxygen. I can't figure out why Illya asked me that question.::
67835::$$$message_0628_0019_0000$$$::"Illya?"[lr]::
67836::$$$message_0628_0019_0001$$$::"...Sorry. But that's enough. You don't have to do this anymore, Shirou. Just escape on your own."[lr]::
67837::$$$message_0628_0019_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67838::$$$message_0628_0019_0003$$$::Illya looks gloomy.[lr]::
67839::$$$message_0628_0019_0004$$$::My head won't work.[lr]::
67840::$$$message_0628_0019_0005$$$::So I just get angry instead.::
67841::$$$message_0628_0020_0000$$$::"Damn it, don't throw a tantrum right now! Come on, Illya. This isn't the time!"[lr]::
67842::$$$message_0628_0020_0001$$$::"Ah!?"::
67843::$$$message_0628_0021_0000$$$::I pull Illya's arm.[lr]::
67844::$$$message_0628_0021_0001$$$::She's so small, but she's trying to help me. It feels so terribly precious.::
67845::$$$message_0628_0022_0000$$$::"Wait, what are you doing, Shirou!? I said that's enough! You can still make it if you go by yourself!"[lr]::
67846::$$$message_0628_0022_0001$$$::She hammers her little fists on my head.[lr]::
67847::$$$message_0628_0022_0002$$$::I ignore it.::
67848::$$$message_0628_0023_0000$$$::"Shut up! If I could do that, I never would've come here in the first place!"[lr]::
67849::$$$message_0628_0023_0001$$$::I hug Illya tight.::
67850::$$$message_0628_0024_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
67851::$$$message_0628_0024_0001$$$::Her eyes ask me why.[lr]::
67852::$$$message_0628_0024_0002$$$::What a dumb question.[lr]::
67853::$$$message_0628_0024_0003$$$::It doesn't matter why!::
67854::$$$message_0628_0025_0000$$$::"Do I need a reason!? I just want to protect you! A big brother is supposed to protect his sister, all right!?"[lr]::
67855::$$$message_0628_0025_0001$$$::"Excuse me!? That's stupid! I'm not even your little sister!"[lr]::
67856::$$$message_0628_0025_0002$$$::"It doesn't matter! You called me 'big brother' once, so I'm your big brother now! Even if we're not related by blood, you're my sister, Illya!"::
67857::$$$message_0628_0026_0000$$$::"Shirou..."[lr]::
67858::$$$message_0628_0026_0001$$$::The dark giant turns this way.[lr]::
67859::$$$message_0628_0026_0002$$$::"Run! He's coming!"[lr]::
67860::$$$message_0628_0026_0003$$$::I can think later.[lr]::
67861::$$$message_0628_0026_0004$$$::Right now, I need to put as much distance between us as possible!::
67862::$$$message_0628_0027_0000$$$::    It's a little strange.[lr]::
67863::$$$message_0628_0027_0001$$$::The speed with which Shirou Emiya runs with Illya in tow far surpasses what she knows he's physically capable of.::
67864::$$$message_0628_0028_0000$$$::They come into a familiar clearing.[lr]::
67865::$$$message_0628_0028_0001$$$::"Ah, hah, ngh, hah...!"[lr]::
67866::$$$message_0628_0028_0002$$$::The choking, ragged breaths belong to Illya.[lr]::
67867::$$$message_0628_0028_0003$$$::I don't feel out of breath at all. Maybe my body's gone numb.[lr]::
67868::$$$message_0628_0028_0004$$$::It feels hard because I lack oxygen, but it's like I'm not even breathing.[lr]::
67869::$$$message_0628_0028_0005$$$::Like I'm a dead man.[lr]::
67870::$$$message_0628_0028_0006$$$::My heart's been on a complete strike for a while now.::
67871::$$$message_0628_0029_0000$$$::"Ah, I'm okay[line2]burgh[line2]I can...still run...!"[lr]::
67872::$$$message_0628_0029_0001$$$::Illya's fingers feel scarily hot as they grip mine.[lr]::
67873::$$$message_0628_0029_0002$$$::She's never had the physical strength to keep running like this.[lr]::
67874::$$$message_0628_0029_0003$$$::Her creators never thought she'd have to engage in physical exercise like other humans while they were designing her.::
67875::$$$message_0628_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67876::$$$message_0628_0030_0001$$$::I have a headache.[lr]::
67877::$$$message_0628_0030_0002$$$::Knowledge I don't know is entering my brain.[lr]::
67878::$$$message_0628_0030_0003$$$::They're distractions.[lr]::
67879::$$$message_0628_0030_0004$$$::We need to get away from here.[lr]::
67880::$$$message_0628_0030_0005$$$::The giant is closing in on us, even though its intellect and senses are sealed.::
67881::$$$message_0628_0031_0000$$$::For a while, it seemed to go in the wrong direction, but I don't like how fast it's getting.[lr]::
67882::$$$message_0628_0031_0001$$$::My legs are shaking, and I calmly judge that I won't be able to move more than ten more meters.::
67883::$$$message_0628_0032_0000$$$::Illya can't run anymore, either.[lr]::
67884::$$$message_0628_0032_0001$$$::We could try to hide, but there's no cover around here to conceal us.[lr]::
67885::$$$message_0628_0032_0002$$$::Naturally, it wouldn't do a lick of good to hide from a Berserker that can't see to begin with.::
67886::$$$message_0628_0033_0000$$$::"...I've got it."[lr]::
67887::$$$message_0628_0033_0001$$$::We can count one small blessing.[lr]::
67888::$$$message_0628_0033_0002$$$::There's a crevice in the clearing that widens into a ditch.[lr]::
67889::$$$message_0628_0033_0003$$$::It's a scar that Saber's Noble Phantasm left on the ground.::
67890::$$$message_0628_0034_0000$$$::"This way, Illya!"[lr]::
67891::$$$message_0628_0034_0001$$$::I take Illya and jump into the ditch.::
67892::$$$message_0628_0035_0000$$$::The trench is easily wide enough for two.[lr]::
67893::$$$message_0628_0035_0001$$$::"Ha... ahh."[lr]::
67894::$$$message_0628_0035_0002$$$::I rest my back against the bare earth.[lr]::
67895::$$$message_0628_0035_0003$$$::I look up at the sky, catching my breath.[lr]::
67896::$$$message_0628_0035_0004$$$::The sky looks small and cut off from us. It's like we're underground.::
67897::$$$message_0628_0036_0000$$$::"Hah... Ahh, ah..."[lr]::
67898::$$$message_0628_0036_0001$$$::I take deep breaths.[lr]::
67899::$$$message_0628_0036_0002$$$::I use this short pause to rest and calm my frayed mind.::
67900::$$$message_0628_0037_0000$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
67901::$$$message_0628_0037_0001$$$::But our repose only lasts for a moment.[lr]::
67902::$$$message_0628_0037_0002$$$::The giant won't lose us.[lr]::
67903::$$$message_0628_0037_0003$$$::No matter where we run, it'll track us down, capture us, and slaughter us.::
67904::$$$message_0628_0038_0000$$$::"...Ah...Ngh..."[lr]::
67905::$$$message_0628_0038_0001$$$::The girl next to me is curled up, trying to keep her voice down.[lr]::
67906::$$$message_0628_0038_0002$$$::Illya stifles her voice and hugs herself, trying not to burden me.::
67907::$$$message_0628_0039_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67908::$$$message_0628_0039_0001$$$::We're at the end of the line.[lr]::
67909::$$$message_0628_0039_0002$$$::We can't run anymore, and I can't keep it in check.[lr]::
67910::$$$message_0628_0039_0003$$$::I look at the red shroud around my left arm.[lr]::
67911::$$$message_0628_0039_0004$$$::Our one way out has been waiting for me to unlock it.::
67912::$$$message_0628_0040_0000$$$::I'll die.[lr]::
67913::$$$message_0628_0040_0001$$$::Kotomine said that it's the fuse on a time bomb.[lr]::
67914::$$$message_0628_0040_0002$$$::I'm reminded of my earlier pain.[lr]::
67915::$$$message_0628_0040_0003$$$::A single Projection almost shattered me.[lr]::
67916::$$$message_0628_0040_0004$$$::I can't imagine how agonizing it would be once I unwrap this arm.::
67917::$$$message_0628_0041_0000$$$::The trigger is always in my mind.[lr]::
67918::$$$message_0628_0041_0001$$$::If I reach for the shroud, it's no different from putting the muzzle of a gun in my mouth and pulling the trigger.[lr]::
67919::$$$message_0628_0041_0002$$$::The hammer will fall if I unwrap the shroud.[lr]::
67920::$$$message_0628_0041_0003$$$::My brains will be blown out the back of my skull, and everything will end.::
67921::$$$message_0628_0042_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67922::$$$message_0628_0042_0001$$$::Make up your damn mind.[lr]::
67923::$$$message_0628_0042_0002$$$::I've always known the answer.[lr]::
67924::$$$message_0628_0042_0003$$$::I'll bring Illya back and save Sakura.[lr]::
67925::$$$message_0628_0042_0004$$$::I know what that means.[lr]::
67926::$$$message_0628_0042_0005$$$::I'll keep protecting Illya, defeat that alien Shadow, and tear Sakura away from it.::
67927::$$$message_0628_0043_0000$$$::That's the impossible miracle I've wished for.[lr]::
67928::$$$message_0628_0043_0001$$$::Even now, I desire that outcome with every fiber of my being.[lr]::
67929::$$$message_0628_0043_0002$$$::I know it's a dream[line2]an ideal[line2]that will never come true, but I've never even considered giving up on it.::
67930::$$$message_0628_0044_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
67931::$$$message_0628_0044_0001$$$::So I have to go.[lr]::
67932::$$$message_0628_0044_0002$$$::I'll save Sakura and help Illya.[lr]::
67933::$$$message_0628_0044_0003$$$::I can't do it.[lr]::
67934::$$$message_0628_0044_0004$$$::Sakura is dying. Her path contains nothing but destruction.[lr]::
67935::$$$message_0628_0044_0005$$$::Someone told me that it would take a miracle to save her.::
67936::$$$message_0628_0045_0000$$$::    That's right.[lr]::
67937::$$$message_0628_0045_0001$$$::Salvation that humans can't achieve.[lr]::
67938::$$$message_0628_0045_0002$$$::To acquire a miracle that you can't achieve on your own, you have to pay an appropriate price.[lr]::
67939::$$$message_0628_0045_0003$$$::You can't protect yourself while saving someone else.[lr]::
67940::$$$message_0628_0045_0004$$$::What if the only way to rescue Sakura from her path to ruin...[lr]::
67941::$$$message_0628_0045_0005$$$::...is to have someone else trade places with her?::
67942::$$$message_0628_0046_0000$$$::The earth trembles.[lr]::
67943::$$$message_0628_0046_0001$$$::A living tempest is charging towards us.::
67944::$$$message_0628_0047_0000$$$::"...I'm going out there. Is it all right if I take him down, Illya?"[lr]::
67945::$$$message_0628_0047_0001$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
67946::$$$message_0628_0047_0002$$$::Illya looks up in shock.[lr]::
67947::$$$message_0628_0047_0003$$$::She's realized that I'm holding my left arm with my right hand.::
67948::$$$message_0628_0048_0000$$$::"No...! You can't do that! There's no going back once you use Archer's arm...! You'll die. No, you'll get killed before that.

68074::$$$message_0628_0087_0002$$$::I cut through the wind with my limbs, as if I'm swinging greatswords.::

68078::$$$message_0628_0090_0001$$$::I step onto the earth.[lr]::
68079::$$$message_0628_0090_0002$$$::The wind has gone still.[lr]::
68080::$$$message_0628_0090_0003$$$::The dark giant is thirty meters away.[lr]::
68081::$$$message_0628_0090_0004$$$::He can reach me in less than three seconds.[lr]::
68082::$$$message_0628_0090_0005$$$::   That's why...[lr]::
68083::$$$message_0628_0090_0006$$$::I'll finish this in three seconds.::
68084::$$$message_0628_0091_0000$$$::My mind is razor-sharp.[lr]::

68088::$$$message_0628_0091_0004$$$::I inherit Archer's accumulated skills, experience, and physical strength. Correction[line2]I fail to load his physique. I'll still die if Berserker slashes me.::
68089::$$$message_0628_0092_0000$$$::I cannot use his Reality Marble, Unlimited Blade Works.[lr]::
68090::$$$message_0628_0092_0001$$$::Archer's inner world is different than mine. I can't recreate it.[lr]::
68091::$$$message_0628_0092_0002$$$::All I can replicate are the Noble Phantasms he's recorded, and the things which Shirou Emiya has personally learned.[lr]::
68092::$$$message_0628_0092_0003$$$::If I decide to draw a Noble Phantasm from my left arm, it will search Unlimited Blade Works for the most appropriate weapon to my purpose, and replicate it.::
68093::$$$message_0628_0093_0000$$$::Be warned, however.[lr]::
68094::$$$message_0628_0093_0001$$$::Projection is a double-edged sword.[lr]::

68097::$$$message_0628_0094_0001$$$::I hold my breath and cram all of my magical energy into my left arm.[lr]::
68098::$$$message_0628_0094_0002$$$::I just need a weapon that I can use.[lr]::
68099::$$$message_0628_0094_0003$$$::I'm well aware of the risks.[lr]::

68103::$$$message_0628_0095_0001$$$::I stare at him.[lr]::

68105::$$$message_0628_0095_0003$$$::I spread my left hand and take hold of an imaginary weapon that has yet to appear.[lr]::
68106::$$$message_0628_0095_0004$$$::It's incredibly massive.[lr]::
68107::$$$message_0628_0095_0005$$$::Shirou Emiya cannot handle this sword.[lr]::
68108::$$$message_0628_0095_0006$$$::But this left arm can replicate the enemy's monstrous strength.::
68109::$$$message_0628_0096_0000$$$::"...Argh."[lr]::
68110::$$$message_0628_0096_0001$$$::Something breaks.[lr]::
68111::$$$message_0628_0096_0002$$$::A part of my chest shatters with a metallic sound.[lr]::
68112::$$$message_0628_0096_0003$$$::My skeleton buckles under the flow of magical energy. It's pathetic, like an apple peel.::
68113::$$$message_0628_0097_0000$$$::"...Here I go."[lr]::
68114::$$$message_0628_0097_0001$$$::I'm beyond worrying.[lr]::
68115::$$$message_0628_0097_0002$$$::The arm will make up for my broken parts.[lr]::
68116::$$$message_0628_0097_0003$$$::I devote my undivided attention to killing my enemy.::

68118::$$$message_0628_0098_0001$$$::He's noticed.[lr]::
68119::$$$message_0628_0098_0002$$$::His bloodlust focuses on me.[lr]::
68120::$$$message_0628_0098_0003$$$::The dark giant senses my magecraft as a hostile act, and his eyes move.::
68121::$$$message_0628_0099_0000$$$::They're like black, ominous stars.[lr]::
68122::$$$message_0628_0099_0001$$$::The giant roars a death cry and storms in to slaughter his enemy.::
68123::$$$message_0628_0100_0000$$$::   Berserker.[lr]::
68124::$$$message_0628_0100_0001$$$::In his rage, the giant hasn't changed.[lr]::
68125::$$$message_0628_0100_0002$$$::He's still trapped in his battle with Saber.[lr]::
68126::$$$message_0628_0100_0003$$$::Blind, insane, and rotting, he dies a second death while still fighting to protect Illya.::
68127::$$$message_0628_0101_0000$$$::[line10]One second.::

68134::$$$message_0628_0104_0000$$$::I visualize nine blows.[lr]::

68137::$$$message_0628_0106_0000$$$::He's in front of me. The greatsword comes down.[lr]::
68138::$$$message_0628_0106_0001$$$::Air pressure viciously whips me.[lr]::
68139::$$$message_0628_0106_0002$$$::I step in to meet the assault.[lr]::
68140::$$$message_0628_0106_0003$$$::My aim focuses on eight vital points.[lr]::

68144::$$$message_0628_0108_0001$$$::He won't go down.[lr]::
68145::$$$message_0628_0108_0002$$$::Berserker's still standing, even after being ravaged by his own weapon.::

68147::$$$message_0628_0109_0001$$$::I take another step forward.[lr]::
68148::$$$message_0628_0109_0002$$$::My left hand holds a giant sword.[lr]::
68149::$$$message_0628_0109_0003$$$::I'm faster.[lr]::
68150::$$$message_0628_0109_0004$$$::Berserker's dying without eight-tenths of his body. I can finish him first.[lr]::
68151::$$$message_0628_0109_0005$$$::I lift the sword to chest height and drive it in, like a spear.::
68152::$$$message_0628_0110_0000$$$::"[wacky len=16][line4]!!!"[lr]::
68153::$$$message_0628_0110_0001$$$::But, I lost.[lr]::
68154::$$$message_0628_0110_0002$$$::My initiative didn't matter.[lr]::
68155::$$$message_0628_0110_0003$$$::I used every last drop of the rule-breaking power I was given, and I still lost.[lr]::
68156::$$$message_0628_0110_0004$$$::Berserker's attack comes swinging down.[lr]::
68157::$$$message_0628_0110_0005$$$::It kicks up a tempest that buffets me.::

68159::$$$message_0628_0111_0001$$$::I twist my body,[lr]::

68161::$$$message_0628_0111_0003$$$::I saw the attack coming.[lr]::
68162::$$$message_0628_0111_0004$$$::I can dodge this.[lr]::
68163::$$$message_0628_0111_0005$$$::Berserker's slash will only graze my temple.::
68164::$$$message_0628_0112_0000$$$::    But even that would be lethal.[lr]::
68165::$$$message_0628_0112_0001$$$::He only needs to graze me by a few millimeters to kill me.[lr]::
68166::$$$message_0628_0112_0002$$$::A direct blow would be literally earth-shattering.[lr]::
68167::$$$message_0628_0112_0003$$$::A close shave by his sword tip would splatter my head like tofu.::
68168::$$$message_0628_0113_0000$$$::The greatsword swoops in.[lr]::
68169::$$$message_0628_0113_0001$$$::My vision freezes the instant my head is about to be taken off.[lr]::
68170::$$$message_0628_0113_0002$$$::But...[lr]::
68171::$$$message_0628_0113_0003$$$::His greatsword, swung with menacing drive,[lr]::

68173::$$$message_0628_0114_0000$$$::"...Huh?"[lr]::
68174::$$$message_0628_0114_0001$$$::The executioner's axe stops short of my neck.[lr]::
68175::$$$message_0628_0114_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68176::$$$message_0628_0114_0003$$$::The dark giant is looking at something in front of him.[lr]::
68177::$$$message_0628_0114_0004$$$::Not at me.[lr]::
68178::$$$message_0628_0114_0005$$$::His mindless eyes are staring at a pale girl peeking out of the trench.::
68179::$$$message_0628_0115_0000$$$::I pierce him.[lr]::
68180::$$$message_0628_0115_0001$$$::I don't miss the opportunity to mercilessly drive my sword through Berserker's heart.::
68181::$$$message_0628_0116_0000$$$::He doesn't fight back.[lr]::
68182::$$$message_0628_0116_0001$$$::This time, the giant's remaining life crumbles to dust.::
68183::$$$message_0628_0117_0000$$$::In those final moments,[lr]::
68184::$$$message_0628_0117_0001$$$::his fading red eyes urge me to protect her.::
68185::$$$message_0628_0118_0000$$$::    The battle only lasted a moment.[lr]::
68186::$$$message_0628_0118_0001$$$::It really was finished in the span of a single breath.::
68187::$$$message_0628_0119_0000$$$::With trembling lips, the boy told the girl that he was leaving.[lr]::
68188::$$$message_0628_0119_0001$$$::He took the red bindings in his hand and left her side, swallowing his fatigue and his worry.::
68189::$$$message_0628_0120_0000$$$::She came out of the ditch to stop him.[lr]::
68190::$$$message_0628_0120_0001$$$::For an instant, she watched his back shrink into the distance, unsure what to say or if she should stop him, until she couldn't take it and came out after him.[lr]::
68191::$$$message_0628_0120_0002$$$::Less than ten seconds had passed.[lr]::
68192::$$$message_0628_0120_0003$$$::That brief hesitation decided the outcome of the duel.::
68193::$$$message_0628_0121_0000$$$::"Shiro[line2]"[lr]::
68194::$$$message_0628_0121_0001$$$::She emerges from the trench.[lr]::
68195::$$$message_0628_0121_0002$$$::The battle was already over.[lr]::
68196::$$$message_0628_0121_0003$$$::Her giant protector looked at her as he disappeared.[lr]::
68197::$$$message_0628_0121_0004$$$::A breeze enters the clearing, as if to announce the end of the fight.[lr]::
68198::$$$message_0628_0121_0005$$$::All she can see is the boy's back.::
68199::$$$message_0628_0122_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68200::$$$message_0628_0122_0001$$$::The battle is over.[lr]::
68201::$$$message_0628_0122_0002$$$::The arm is no longer a Heroic Spirit's arm.[lr]::
68202::$$$message_0628_0122_0003$$$::The boy challenged death with his own power, and won.[lr]::
68203::$$$message_0628_0122_0004$$$::She keeps watch over him.[lr]::
68204::$$$message_0628_0122_0005$$$::From behind, it seems as if he'll never look at her again.::
68205::$$$message_0628_0123_0000$$$::Freed of the holy shroud, the victorious boy looks so gallant.[lr]::
68206::$$$message_0628_0123_0001$$$::He won't show any more doubt.[lr]::
68207::$$$message_0628_0123_0002$$$::The moment he tore the shroud off and created that Projection, he cast off all distractions.::
68208::$$$message_0628_0124_0000$$$::"...Shirou."[lr]::
68209::$$$message_0628_0124_0001$$$::She watches him gloomily from behind.[lr]::
68210::$$$message_0628_0124_0002$$$::The boy has become someone else. [font italic=true]Something[font italic=false] else.[lr]::
68211::$$$message_0628_0124_0003$$$::   He has chosen a foolish but noble conclusion, and there is no going back.::
68212::$$$message_0628_0125_0000$$$::"...Hah..."[lr]::
68213::$$$message_0628_0125_0001$$$::I restart my frozen lungs.[lr]::
68214::$$$message_0628_0125_0002$$$::My left arm feels hot, and my entire body aches.[lr]::
68215::$$$message_0628_0125_0003$$$::An electric eel coils its way through my body.::
68216::$$$message_0628_0126_0000$$$::"Argh...zzhh..."[lr]::
68217::$$$message_0628_0126_0001$$$::I can't possibly stand.[lr]::
68218::$$$message_0628_0126_0002$$$::Hurry.[lr]::
68219::$$$message_0628_0126_0003$$$::I need to hurry and wrap my arm in the shroud again. [stopnoise]I'll hit the time limit unless I escape this pain.::
68220::$$$message_0628_0127_0000$$$::"Ngh...Hahh...argh."[lr]::
68221::$$$message_0628_0127_0001$$$::But I can't seal it back up quite yet.[lr]::
68222::$$$message_0628_0127_0002$$$::I can rest and put down this arm[lr]::
68223::$$$message_0628_0127_0003$$$::once I defeat [font italic=true]her[font italic=false].::
68224::$$$message_0628_0128_0000$$$::"...Saber."[lr]::
68225::$$$message_0628_0128_0001$$$::I face Saber. I swallow my pain and steel myself for another fight.[lr]::
68226::$$$message_0628_0128_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
68227::$$$message_0628_0128_0003$$$::Saber slowly approaches, as if she'd always intended to tag in for the defeated giant.::
68228::$$$message_0628_0129_0000$$$::...She stops.[lr]::
68229::$$$message_0628_0129_0001$$$::She's seven meters away, close enough for her to close the gap and strike in one breath.::
68230::$$$message_0628_0130_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68231::$$$message_0628_0130_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
68232::$$$message_0628_0130_0002$$$::I face her head-on.::
68233::$$$message_0628_0131_0000$$$::   I'm going to die.[lr]::
68234::$$$message_0628_0131_0001$$$::I can't move after fighting Berserker.[lr]::
68235::$$$message_0628_0131_0002$$$::I won't be able to avoid being cut in two when Saber rushes me.::
68236::$$$message_0628_0132_0000$$$::That's not all.[lr]::
68237::$$$message_0628_0132_0001$$$::I wouldn't be able to beat her, even if I was at my best.[lr]::
68238::$$$message_0628_0132_0002$$$::No matter what I do, I can't Project anything stronger than Saber's Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
68239::$$$message_0628_0132_0003$$$::So, this outcome is certain.[lr]::
68240::$$$message_0628_0132_0004$$$::The only person who could defeat Saber is someone with a Noble Phantasm rivalling hers.::
68241::$$$message_0628_0133_0000$$$::"...Hah."[lr]::
68242::$$$message_0628_0133_0001$$$::But that's a contradiction.[lr]::
68243::$$$message_0628_0133_0002$$$::In sheer offensive power, Saber has the ultimate Noble Phantasm.[lr]::
68244::$$$message_0628_0133_0003$$$::Well, there might be Heroic Spirits with stronger weapons than her sacred sword, but they're not in this Holy Grail War.[lr]::
68245::$$$message_0628_0133_0004$$$::Right now, only Saber's sword can defeat her.::
68246::$$$message_0628_0134_0000$$$::So it's a contradiction.[lr]::
68247::$$$message_0628_0134_0001$$$::In this situation, Saber is the strongest Servant.[lr]::
68248::$$$message_0628_0134_0002$$$::...The last time I saw Sakura, she had an inconceivable amount of magical energy.[lr]::
68249::$$$message_0628_0134_0003$$$::Even Sakura wouldn't be able to beat Saber.[lr]::
68250::$$$message_0628_0134_0004$$$::Unlike when I was her Master, Saber now has an adequate energy source. She's effectively invincible.::
68251::$$$message_0628_0135_0000$$$::"How futile. I warned you that you cannot save Sakura, and this is what you do?"[lr]::
68252::$$$message_0628_0135_0001$$$::Saber's voice is stone cold.[lr]::
68253::$$$message_0628_0135_0002$$$::"...!"[lr]::
68254::$$$message_0628_0135_0003$$$::That's the signal.[lr]::
68255::$$$message_0628_0135_0004$$$::She comes to cut me down, without a shred of hesitation or mercy.::
68256::$$$message_0628_0136_0000$$$::"Kh..."[lr]::
68257::$$$message_0628_0136_0001$$$::So what?[lr]::
68258::$$$message_0628_0136_0002$$$::I can't let her kill me here.[lr]::
68259::$$$message_0628_0136_0003$$$::I can't lose, even if I'm fighting Saber.[lr]::
68260::$$$message_0628_0136_0004$$$::I might not be able to beat her, but I can at least take Illya and get away[line2]::
68261::$$$message_0628_0137_0000$$$::"Consider yourself lucky. I no longer need to bother with someone who will eventually kill himself. Sakura calls for me."[lr]::
68262::$$$message_0628_0137_0001$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
68263::$$$message_0628_0137_0002$$$::Saber turns her back on me and starts heading deep into the forest.::
68264::$$$message_0628_0138_0000$$$::"...No, not luck. You defeated Berserker and survived through your own efforts. Your determination brought about this outcome."[lr]::
68265::$$$message_0628_0138_0001$$$::Saber leaves without turning back.::
68266::$$$message_0628_0139_0000$$$::...I can't stop her.[lr]::
68267::$$$message_0628_0139_0001$$$::She's the enemy.[lr]::
68268::$$$message_0628_0139_0002$$$::Whatever her reasons, I can only be grateful that she let us go.[lr]::
68269::$$$message_0628_0139_0003$$$::I'm wounded from head to toe. I can't afford to ask an enemy to stay.::
68270::$$$message_0628_0140_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
68271::$$$message_0628_0140_0001$$$::I bite back the pain and turn in the opposite direction as Saber fades into the distance.[lr]::
68272::$$$message_0628_0140_0002$$$::I need to take Illya and leave this forest.[lr]::
68273::$$$message_0628_0140_0003$$$::...Saber isn't our only enemy.[lr]::
68274::$$$message_0628_0140_0004$$$::We might have gotten away from Sakura and the Shadow, but Zouken is still a threat as long as he's around.::
68275::$$$message_0628_0141_0000$$$::"Rrgh...guh."[lr]::
68276::$$$message_0628_0141_0001$$$::I know what's happening to my body. I know what will happen.[lr]::
68277::$$$message_0628_0141_0002$$$::I have three Projections left.[lr]::
68278::$$$message_0628_0141_0003$$$::...No, even one would be risky, if I want to stay in one piece.::
68279::$$$message_0628_0142_0000$$$::I can't face Zouken and Assassin in this condition.[lr]::
68280::$$$message_0628_0142_0001$$$::There's no point if my body tears itself apart right after I win.[lr]::
68281::$$$message_0628_0142_0002$$$::I need to keep my promise to Tohsaka and save myself for that final effort.[lr]::
68282::$$$message_0628_0142_0003$$$::I might not be able to fight anymore, but there's still hope.::
68283::$$$message_0628_0143_0000$$$::"Shirou...?"[lr]::
68284::$$$message_0628_0143_0001$$$::I hear Illya's voice.::
68285::$$$message_0628_0144_0000$$$::"...Yeah. We should get out of the forest as soon as we can.[lr]::
68286::$$$message_0628_0144_0001$$$::If Saber[line2]if Sakura changes her mind, we won't have another chance."[lr]::
68287::$$$message_0628_0144_0002$$$::I can't look at Illya.[lr]::
68288::$$$message_0628_0144_0003$$$::My heartbeat drums a cacophony that's bouncing around inside my skull.::$
