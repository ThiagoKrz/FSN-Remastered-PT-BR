35933::$$$message_0300_0000_0000$$$::It's past 7 AM.[lr]::
35934::$$$message_0300_0000_0001$$$::It's later than usual, but I should make it on time without having to hurry.::
35935::$$$message_0300_0001_0000$$$::It's 7:40 AM.[lr]::
35936::$$$message_0300_0001_0001$$$::I go through the gate with plenty of time and as I make my way to the building...[lr]::
35937::$$$message_0300_0001_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
35938::$$$message_0300_0001_0003$$$::I'm overcome with a strange feeling and stop in place.::
35939::$$$message_0300_0002_0000$$$::"...What is that? I guess there's nothing wrong..."::
35940::$$$message_0300_0003_0000$$$::It's not like someone is watching me nor is the view any different.[lr]::
35941::$$$message_0300_0003_0001$$$::If anything... It would be that it's muted.[lr]::
35942::$$$message_0300_0003_0002$$$::Like there's some sort of illusion going on. Everything...the students, the trees, even the school buildings all feel like they've lost their color.::
35943::$$$message_0300_0004_0000$$$::"...Maybe it's my imagination. I might be hypersensitive from everything going on."[lr]::
35944::$$$message_0300_0004_0001$$$::I close my eyes and rotate my shoulders.[lr]::
35945::$$$message_0300_0004_0002$$$::...But...[lr]::
35946::$$$message_0300_0004_0003$$$::Even after taking a deep breath, that unknown strange feeling doesn't disappear.::
35947::$$$message_0300_0005_0000$$$::I go up to the third floor and head to my classroom.[lr]::
35948::$$$message_0300_0005_0001$$$::Then...[lr]::
35949::$$$message_0300_0005_0002$$$::I run into Tohsaka.::
35950::$$$message_0300_0006_0000$$$::"Yo."[lr]::
35951::$$$message_0300_0006_0001$$$::Since we do know each other now, I casually greet her.[lr]::
35952::$$$message_0300_0006_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
35953::$$$message_0300_0006_0003$$$::But, Tohsaka is frozen as if she saw a ghost.::
35954::$$$message_0300_0007_0000$$$::"Tohsaka? What, is there something on my face?"[lr]::
35955::$$$message_0300_0007_0001$$$::I wipe my cheek with the sleeve of my uniform.[lr]::
35956::$$$message_0300_0007_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
35957::$$$message_0300_0007_0003$$$::Tohsaka still doesn't reply.[lr]::
35958::$$$message_0300_0007_0004$$$::She looks away and goes back to her classroom.::
35959::$$$message_0300_0008_0000$$$::I'm confused.[lr]::
35960::$$$message_0300_0008_0001$$$::What was with that reaction?[lr]::
35961::$$$message_0300_0008_0002$$$::I don't think it's like her to ignore someone who greeted her.::
35962::$$$message_0300_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
35963::$$$message_0300_0009_0001$$$::The strange feeling hits me again once I enter the classroom.[lr]::
35964::$$$message_0300_0009_0002$$$::Someone might've brought in some snacks here, since I smell something slightly sweet. ::
35965::$$$message_0300_0010_0000$$$::"...I guess the classroom is the same as usual."[lr]::
35966::$$$message_0300_0010_0001$$$::I greet the other boys and sit at my seat.[lr]::
35967::$$$message_0300_0010_0002$$$::There's ten more minutes until homeroom starts.[lr]::
35968::$$$message_0300_0010_0003$$$::I look around the classroom and notice a seat without a bag.::
35969::$$$message_0300_0011_0000$$$::"Shinji's absent, huh?"[lr]::
35970::$$$message_0300_0011_0001$$$::Come to think of it, he missed yesterday's practice too.[lr]::
35971::$$$message_0300_0011_0002$$$::Despite how he looks, Shinji is punctual and tries hard to follow the rules. [lr]::
35972::$$$message_0300_0011_0003$$$::It bothers me a bit that a guy like that has been absent for two days.::
35973::$$$message_0300_0012_0000$$$::It's lunch time.[lr]::
35974::$$$message_0300_0012_0001$$$::I usually go to the student council room on the days that I make my own lunch.[lr]::
35975::$$$message_0300_0012_0002$$$::If I eat in the classroom, the guys will take my food and the girls will tease me.::
35976::$$$message_0300_0013_0000$$$::"What's wrong, Issei? You're not eating lunch?"[lr]::
35977::$$$message_0300_0013_0001$$$::"Oh, I just finished. I'm really sleepy right now. Wake me up before lunch break is over, will you?"[lr]::
35978::$$$message_0300_0013_0002$$$::Issei says and puts his head down on the table.::
35979::$$$message_0300_0014_0000$$$::"Did you pull an all nighter or something? I thought you have to go to bed by eleven at the temple."[lr]::
35980::$$$message_0300_0014_0001$$$::"Correct...that is how it goes, but I haven't been able to sleep well lately. No matter how much I sleep, I can't get rid of my fatigue. I've been sleeping whenever I get the chance."::
35981::$$$message_0300_0015_0000$$$::"Mm...? What do you mean? If you're sleeping at any chance you get, then you shouldn't be sleepy."[lr]::
35982::$$$message_0300_0015_0001$$$::"I would think so too, but since I can't get rid of my fatigue no matter how much I sleep, I have to sleep to get rid of my fatigue.[lr]::
35983::$$$message_0300_0015_0002$$$::...I know it's contradictory, but I can't help it."::
35984::$$$message_0300_0016_0000$$$::"...Man. It's too early to be sleeping like a log in spring, Issei."[lr]::
35985::$$$message_0300_0016_0001$$$::"'I slumbered spring's morning and missed the dawn from everywhere.' That touches a sore spot."[lr]::
35986::$$$message_0300_0016_0002$$$::Issei doesn't even try to get up.[lr]::
35987::$$$message_0300_0016_0003$$$::Nothing for it, I guess.[lr]::
35988::$$$message_0300_0016_0004$$$::It seems pretty bad, so I'll keep him company until break is over...::
35989::$$$message_0300_0017_0000$$$::"Huh? Issei, someone is here."[lr]::
35990::$$$message_0300_0017_0001$$$::"...I don't care. Tell them that the student council is closed for the day."[lr]::
35991::$$$message_0300_0017_0002$$$::"Well, I can say so if you want... But I think it's Mr. Kuzuki."[lr]::
35992::$$$message_0300_0017_0003$$$::"Oh. That would be bad."::
35993::$$$message_0300_0018_0000$$$::Issei slowly gets up and opens the door.[lr]::
35994::$$$message_0300_0018_0001$$$::"Ryudou. It's about the kyudo club this morning..."[lr]::
35995::$$$message_0300_0018_0002$$$::Kuzuki stops his words after seeing that I'm here.[lr]::
35996::$$$message_0300_0018_0003$$$::Souichirou Kuzuki is the homeroom teacher of class 2-A and also in charge of the student council. He is the strictest teacher of this school and regarded as unfriendly.::
35997::$$$message_0300_0019_0000$$$::"What...? So she didn't even make it home?"[lr]::
35998::$$$message_0300_0019_0001$$$::"Correct. We will most likely call the police. I'm sure you know, but don't go around telling people."::
35999::$$$message_0300_0020_0000$$$::"...I understand. Then, what about Matou? One of the first years from the kyudo club said that they saw her and Matou together."[lr]::
36000::$$$message_0300_0020_0001$$$::"It is the same for him as well. Shinji Matou has an unexcused absence and does not seem to be home either. His sister, Sakura Matou, was staying at Ms. Fujimura's house and does not know anything."::
36001::$$$message_0300_0021_0000$$$::...Issei and Kuzuki are talking about disturbing stuff.[lr]::
36002::$$$message_0300_0021_0001$$$::To summarize what I overheard, there is a student that has been missing since yesterday, and Shinji is the last person she was seen with...::
36003::$$$message_0300_0022_0000$$$::"Sorry to interrupt. I'm sure the school curfew will get earlier due to this."[lr]::
36004::$$$message_0300_0022_0001$$$::Kuzuki just states his business and leaves.::
36005::$$$message_0300_0023_0000$$$::"...Geez. Hey Emiya, have you seen Shinji?"[lr]::
36006::$$$message_0300_0023_0001$$$::"No, I haven't. I didn't go to the archery range this morning. You know that he's absent too."[lr]::
36007::$$$message_0300_0023_0002$$$::"That's how it is..."::
36008::$$$message_0300_0024_0000$$$::Issei's face clouds over.[lr]::
36009::$$$message_0300_0024_0001$$$::   Well, this sucks.[lr]::
36010::$$$message_0300_0024_0002$$$::It's not something I should poke my nose into, but it seems like this concerns the kyudo club.[lr]::
36011::$$$message_0300_0024_0003$$$::I'm sorry for Issei, but I should get some information out of him.::
36012::$$$message_0300_0025_0000$$$::"Issei. You said this person didn't come home yesterday, but who is it? Well, I already know that Shinji also hasn't been home."[lr]::
36013::$$$message_0300_0025_0001$$$::"Mm? Well, you're no outsider, so I suppose you can know."::
36014::$$$message_0300_0026_0000$$$::"It's about last night.[lr]::
36015::$$$message_0300_0026_0001$$$::A family contacted us saying that their daughter who went to kyudo practice hadn't come home. When we asked the students who participated, we found that the last person to see the missing student was Shinji."[lr]::
36016::$$$message_0300_0026_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36017::$$$message_0300_0026_0003$$$::Shinji, huh?::
36018::$$$message_0300_0027_0000$$$::"Hold on. Shinji wasn't at yesterday's practice.[lr]::
36019::$$$message_0300_0027_0001$$$::And I was with everyone at the gate."::
36020::$$$message_0300_0028_0000$$$::"Yes, that was corroborated as well. This was after that. When one of the first years went back to get something they forgot, Shinji was in front of the dojo. It seems like he was arguing with them."::
36021::$$$message_0300_0029_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36022::$$$message_0300_0029_0001$$$::I have a bad feeling.[lr]::
36023::$$$message_0300_0029_0002$$$::...If there was someone still at the dojo, there could only be one person.::
36024::$$$message_0300_0030_0000$$$::"Don't leave out the important details, Issei. Who's the student who's been missing?"::
36025::$$$message_0300_0031_0000$$$::"...Right. It's the kyudo captain, Ayako Mitsuzuri.[lr]::
36026::$$$message_0300_0031_0001$$$::After she went to return the dojo's key to the teacher's office, she has been missing since she was last seen in front of the archery range."[lr]::
36027::$$$message_0300_0031_0002$$$::Issei averts his gaze, as if it's hard to say.::
36028::$$$message_0300_0032_0000$$$::Classes are over.[lr]::
36029::$$$message_0300_0032_0001$$$::I don't know if it's because of the incident, but club practices are canceled for today.::
36030::$$$message_0300_0033_0000$$$::The library seems to be closed as well, and the students who are done with their homeroom class hurry home.[lr]::
36031::$$$message_0300_0033_0001$$$::There's an announcement telling students to go home unless they have some special reason.[lr]::
36032::$$$message_0300_0033_0002$$$::I'm the only one left in the 2-C classroom.[lr]::
36033::$$$message_0300_0033_0003$$$::The other classrooms are probably the same, so I should hurry or else I'll be the only one stranded in this building.::
36034::$$$message_0300_0034_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
36035::$$$message_0300_0034_0001$$$::Let me ask around before that.[lr]::
36036::$$$message_0300_0034_0002$$$::I can't leave without doing anything after finding out that Mitsuzuri's gone missing. [lr]::
36037::$$$message_0300_0034_0003$$$::She's strong and has more arm muscle than some guys.[lr]::
36038::$$$message_0300_0034_0004$$$::It's a big deal that she's gone missing, and most of all, I can't ignore it as her friend.::
36039::$$$message_0300_0035_0000$$$::"...Sorry, Saber. I have something I have to do."[lr]::
36040::$$$message_0300_0035_0001$$$::I apologize to Saber and leave the classroom.[lr]::
36041::$$$message_0300_0035_0002$$$::I should go talk to people in Mitsuzuri's class, 2-A.::
36042::$$$message_0300_0036_0000$$$::"Huh? ...Um, Ayako is absent today because she's sick."[lr]::
36043::$$$message_0300_0036_0001$$$::"Mitsuzuri is absent. You should know that if you're in the kyudo club."[lr]::
36044::$$$message_0300_0036_0002$$$::"I'm telling you she's absent. Her luck must've run out. Her streak of zero tardies and absences ends today, muahahaha."::
36045::$$$message_0300_0037_0000$$$::That's all I could get from the girls getting ready to go home.[lr]::
36046::$$$message_0300_0037_0001$$$::It seems like everyone in class 2-A has been told that Mitsuzuri is absent due to illness.::
36047::$$$message_0300_0038_0000$$$::"Sorry for interrupting. If Mitsuzuri comes tomorrow, please don't tell her about this."[lr]::
36048::$$$message_0300_0038_0001$$$::I wave goodbye and leave.[lr]::
36049::$$$message_0300_0038_0002$$$::If there's anything else, there's only the archery range left, but...::
36050::$$$message_0300_0039_0000$$$::"...No one's here. Well obviously, there's no practice."[lr]::
36051::$$$message_0300_0039_0001$$$::The door to the range is shut tight.[lr]::
36052::$$$message_0300_0039_0002$$$::There doesn't seem to be anyone inside, so there's no reason to be here.::
36053::$$$message_0300_0040_0000$$$::"...I guess I'll talk to Issei. He might have some new information."[lr]::
36054::$$$message_0300_0040_0001$$$::It's been three hours since lunch.[lr]::
36055::$$$message_0300_0040_0002$$$::There's a possibility that Mitsuzuri has already been found and it turned out to be nothing at all.::
