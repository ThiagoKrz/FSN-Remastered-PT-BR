56806::$$$message_0501_0000_0000$$$::Sakura seems to be in serious condition.[lr]::
56807::$$$message_0501_0000_0001$$$::She collapsed after being exposed to the liquid that splashed on her from the earrings. Kotomine is cleansing her of it while we wait.::
56808::$$$message_0501_0001_0000$$$::Tohsaka doesn't speak.[lr]::
56809::$$$message_0501_0001_0001$$$::Archer isn't present, and Rider is gone, too.[lr]::
56810::$$$message_0501_0001_0002$$$::It's just Tohsaka and I in the church, waiting for Kotomine.::
56811::$$$message_0501_0002_0000$$$::"Tohsaka."[lr]::
56812::$$$message_0501_0002_0001$$$::From my seat, I call out to her.[lr]::
56813::$$$message_0501_0002_0002$$$::"What?"[lr]::
56814::$$$message_0501_0002_0003$$$::"I want to ask you something."::
56815::$$$message_0501_0003_0000$$$::"...I'm sure you do. Fine, I'll talk. There's no point hiding anything now, nor do I have a choice.[lr]::
56816::$$$message_0501_0003_0001$$$::You want to know about Sakura, right?"::
56817::$$$message_0501_0004_0000$$$::I nod.[lr]::
56818::$$$message_0501_0004_0001$$$::Tohsaka sighs quietly, and then begins explaining in her usual tone.::
56819::$$$message_0501_0005_0000$$$::"...It started a long time ago. The Matou bloodline thinned out, meaning that the magical energy...and the Magic Circuits they were born with kept decreasing.[lr]::
56820::$$$message_0501_0005_0001$$$::They originally aren't from here, so the land of Japan probably wasn't suited to them.[lr]::
56821::$$$message_0501_0005_0002$$$::Their decline began when they put down roots in this town, culminating in Shinji, their latest descendant, who was born without any Magic Circuits at all."::
56822::$$$message_0501_0006_0000$$$::"...That was the end of the Matous' history.[lr]::
56823::$$$message_0501_0006_0001$$$::If their goal had been to keep up their traditions, then they would've had options, like adopting an apprentice. But the Matous are an elite family who never accepted outsiders."::
56824::$$$message_0501_0007_0000$$$::"As a result, their magical power declined with each generation, until they finally lost it completely.[lr]::
56825::$$$message_0501_0007_0001$$$::...They tried taking in a disciple after that, but no mage wanted anything to do with a fallen house. That's how the centuries-long history of the Matous[line2]the Makiris[line2]came to an end."::
56826::$$$message_0501_0008_0000$$$::"But that didn't mean they gave up. Shinji's father adopted a child from another family and trained her in the family magecraft."::
56827::$$$message_0501_0009_0000$$$::"So...[lr]::
56828::$$$message_0501_0009_0001$$$::You probably don't know this given your background, but only one child per generation is taught magecraft. Zouken told you that, right?[lr]::
56829::$$$message_0501_0009_0002$$$::If there are siblings, then one becomes the successor, while the other is raised to live a normal life."::
56830::$$$message_0501_0010_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56831::$$$message_0501_0010_0001$$$::They don't need two heirs.[lr]::
56832::$$$message_0501_0010_0002$$$::So if there was a brother and a sister...no, [font italic=true]two sisters[font italic=false], then what would happen to the child who wasn't chosen?::
56833::$$$message_0501_0011_0000$$$::I'm sure that families raise the sibling while hiding magecraft from them.[lr]::
56834::$$$message_0501_0011_0001$$$::But that's difficult and inefficient.[lr]::
56835::$$$message_0501_0011_0002$$$::A lineage that has cultivated its blood and Magic Circuits for generations might produce children with excellent genes. Even if they aren't chosen as the heir, it would be wrong to let those talents go to waste.[lr]::
56836::$$$message_0501_0011_0003$$$::Then, they would...::
56837::$$$message_0501_0012_0000$$$::"Tohsaka."[lr]::
56838::$$$message_0501_0012_0001$$$::"Yeah. I had a sister one year younger than me.[lr]::
56839::$$$message_0501_0012_0002$$$::...The fallen Matous didn't have any mages to adopt, remember?[lr]::
56840::$$$message_0501_0012_0003$$$::It makes sense that they'd ask the Tohsakas, their ancient allies, for help."::
56841::$$$message_0501_0013_0000$$$::"I don't know which of us my father wanted to choose as his heir. I just know I remained as a Tohsaka, and he gave my sister to the Matous.[lr]::
56842::$$$message_0501_0013_0001$$$::That was eleven years ago.[lr]::
56843::$$$message_0501_0013_0002$$$::I haven't really gotten to know her well since then. That was part of the deal. I was told not to interact with her carelessly, since she would be the Matou heir."::
56844::$$$message_0501_0014_0000$$$::"I see. So that's you and Sakura."[lr]::
56845::$$$message_0501_0014_0001$$$::"We're blood sisters... Though, we've never addressed each other as such."::
56846::$$$message_0501_0015_0000$$$::...I can't know the depth of the feelings behind those plain words.[lr]::
56847::$$$message_0501_0015_0001$$$::But, it all makes sense now.[lr]::
56848::$$$message_0501_0015_0002$$$::How she's always asking after Sakura.[lr]::
56849::$$$message_0501_0015_0003$$$::Why she didn't let Archer use his Noble Phantasm.::
56850::$$$message_0501_0016_0000$$$::"...I'm glad to hear that, Tohsaka. You were on Sakura's side all along."[lr]::
56851::$$$message_0501_0016_0001$$$::The revelation is like a beacon in the darkness.[lr]::
56852::$$$message_0501_0016_0002$$$::...I don't know what's going to happen to Sakura, or what we should do with her.[lr]::
56853::$$$message_0501_0016_0003$$$::But in this dark labyrinth of indecision, knowing that Tohsaka cares about Sakura is a ray of hope.::
56854::$$$message_0501_0017_0000$$$::"No. I'm not on her side at all."[lr]::
56855::$$$message_0501_0017_0001$$$::   But then,[lr]::
56856::$$$message_0501_0017_0002$$$::Tohsaka says something in a hard tone, as if reading my mind.::
56857::$$$message_0501_0018_0000$$$::"You're not...?"[lr]::
56858::$$$message_0501_0018_0001$$$::"No. If Sakura doesn't get better, then I'll treat her like any other enemy. I can't overlook a mage that indiscriminately attacks civilians. If Kirei can't heal her, then I'll dispose of her."::
56859::$$$message_0501_0019_0000$$$::"Wha... What the hell are you saying!? She's your little sister, isn't she!? How can you even talk about killing her!?"::
56860::$$$message_0501_0020_0000$$$::"Sakura is the Matous' daughter. She hasn't been my sister for the last eleven years."[lr]::
56861::$$$message_0501_0020_0001$$$::"Tohsaka, you..."::
56862::$$$message_0501_0021_0000$$$::"...Hmph. Even if we're related by blood, it doesn't change the facts. It isn't any of your business."::
56863::$$$message_0501_0022_0000$$$::"Then that makes you..."[lr]::
56864::$$$message_0501_0022_0001$$$::...no different than Shinji.[lr]::
56865::$$$message_0501_0022_0002$$$::I can't bring myself to make the awful comparison aloud.::
56866::$$$message_0501_0023_0000$$$::"What are you doing? The surgery is finished, but the patient is still in danger. If you're going to make a commotion, go do it outside."[lr]::
56867::$$$message_0501_0023_0001$$$::Kirei Kotomine emerges from the church's inner rooms.::
56868::$$$message_0501_0024_0000$$$::"...Honestly, I can't tell if you're at odds or two peas in a pod. I don't understand you two."::
56869::$$$message_0501_0025_0000$$$::"Uh..."[lr]::
56870::$$$message_0501_0025_0001$$$::"H-hmph! You're just getting the wrong idea."::
56871::$$$message_0501_0026_0000$$$::"I see. Then sit. I will explain Sakura Matou's condition."::
56872::$$$message_0501_0027_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56873::$$$message_0501_0027_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56874::$$$message_0501_0027_0002$$$::We sit separately, our attention mutually trained on the priest's next words.::
56875::$$$message_0501_0028_0000$$$::"To put it briefly, there are foreign bodies[line2]insects[line2]throughout Sakura Matou's body. They are called Crest Worms. One might compare them to artificial versions of the Three Corpses from Taoist theory. Does that ring a bell?"::
56876::$$$message_0501_0029_0000$$$::I shake my head.[lr]::
56877::$$$message_0501_0029_0001$$$::He explains that the Three Corpses are demonic parasites that live in a human's body, reporting their evil deeds to Hell.[lr]::
56878::$$$message_0501_0029_0002$$$::That does sound familiar, but I've never heard of Crest Worms before.::
56879::$$$message_0501_0030_0000$$$::"You don't know? Well, they are normally harmless parasites.[lr]::
56880::$$$message_0501_0030_0001$$$::They're familiars that feed on their host's magical energy and carry out their functions. They are the lowest order of familiars, which serve only to transmit their host's vital status."::
56881::$$$message_0501_0031_0000$$$::"...Huh. So they're like monitoring devices made from magecraft.[lr]::
56882::$$$message_0501_0031_0001$$$::Is Zouken using them to monitor Sakura?"[lr]::
56883::$$$message_0501_0031_0002$$$::"Oh? Whoever said that the Crest Worms serve Zouken Matou?"::
56884::$$$message_0501_0032_0000$$$::"...I'm really not in the mood for your games right now. Who else other than that old geezer would plant those things inside her?"[lr]::
56885::$$$message_0501_0032_0001$$$::"You have a point. Shinji Matou cannot handle the Crest Worms. That leaves only that bloodsucking worm to control them."::
56886::$$$message_0501_0033_0000$$$::"Right? So get to the point. Can you save Sakura or not?"::
56887::$$$message_0501_0034_0000$$$::"You're so impatient, Rin. I'm sure you have some idea of her condition, but the young man does not. Shouldn't I explain for his benefit?"[lr]::
56888::$$$message_0501_0034_0001$$$::"Rgh..."[lr]::
56889::$$$message_0501_0034_0002$$$::Tohsaka looks away uncomfortably.[lr]::
56890::$$$message_0501_0034_0003$$$::...That tells me she doesn't want me to know what's wrong with Sakura.::
56891::$$$message_0501_0035_0000$$$::"What about you, Shirou Emiya? Do you want me to skip to the conclusion, like Rin?"[lr]::
56892::$$$message_0501_0035_0001$$$::"...No. Explain it to me from start to finish, Kotomine."::
56893::$$$message_0501_0036_0000$$$::...I feel bad for Tohsaka.[lr]::
56894::$$$message_0501_0036_0001$$$::But I won't budge on this point. If Sakura's life is at stake, then I need to know everything.::
56895::$$$message_0501_0037_0000$$$::"I'll continue, then.[lr]::
56896::$$$message_0501_0037_0001$$$::The Crest Worms I mentioned are eating away at Sakura Matou's nerves.[lr]::
56897::$$$message_0501_0037_0002$$$::It is because they have been growing inside her body for the last eleven years. The Crest Worms now resemble Magic Circuits, fusing throughout her body with her original nerves.[lr]::
56898::$$$message_0501_0037_0003$$$::The worms have become a Magic Crest that is normally dormant, having no impact on her daily life."::
56899::$$$message_0501_0038_0000$$$::"But once active, they consume her nerves, and keep feeding off her magical energy to operate.[lr]::
56900::$$$message_0501_0038_0001$$$::That was the cause of her earlier condition. The Crest Worms were roaming through her body, stealing her magical energy, basically her very life force."::
56901::$$$message_0501_0039_0000$$$::"Had that continued, she would have died in half a day.[lr]::
56902::$$$message_0501_0039_0001$$$::Once the Crest Worms run out of magical energy to feed on, they will turn to Sakura Matou herself for sustenance. Deprived of magical energy, her physical body would be taken over by the worms."::
56903::$$$message_0501_0040_0000$$$::"You have a Magic Crest yourself, so you must know how severe the pain is.[lr]::
56904::$$$message_0501_0040_0001$$$::Introducing even the slightest foreign element into a human body is enough to cause discomfort, and at times interfere with vital functions. Now imagine the agony of having some alien creature intertwine its 'nerves' with your own. The distress you would feel every time they moved would be enough to kill you."::
56905::$$$message_0501_0041_0000$$$::"...On that note, I was surprised that Sakura Matou managed to keep her consciousness intact.[lr]::
56906::$$$message_0501_0041_0001$$$::Perhaps it is because she is strong-willed, or perhaps she has built some tolerance to having the Crest Worms gnaw at her. You would have to ask her yourself."::
56907::$$$message_0501_0042_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56908::$$$message_0501_0042_0001$$$::I hear a noise.[lr]::
56909::$$$message_0501_0042_0002$$$::It turns out I've been grinding my teeth.[lr]::
56910::$$$message_0501_0042_0003$$$::He thinks I can understand her pain if I have a Magic Crest?::
56911::$$$message_0501_0043_0000$$$::How the hell am I supposed to know that?[lr]::
56912::$$$message_0501_0043_0001$$$::I break out into a full-body sweat every time I insert a single Magic Circuit.[lr]::
56913::$$$message_0501_0043_0002$$$::Sakura's ordeal is many times worse.[lr]::
56914::$$$message_0501_0043_0003$$$::Someone like me could never even imagine the depths of her pain.::
56915::$$$message_0501_0044_0000$$$::"...Wait. You said it's only if they're activated. So the Crest Worms aren't usually active?"::
56916::$$$message_0501_0045_0000$$$::"Yes. The drug she was exposed to was designed to awaken the worms.[lr]::
56917::$$$message_0501_0045_0001$$$::They are only meant for surveillance.[lr]::
56918::$$$message_0501_0045_0002$$$::They would only begin feeding as punishment once their host violates some predetermined rule."::
56919::$$$message_0501_0046_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56920::$$$message_0501_0046_0001$$$::I don't think I can listen to the priest talk any longer.[lr]::
56921::$$$message_0501_0046_0002$$$::I know it isn't his fault, but hearing him describe this makes me wanna punch him.::
56922::$$$message_0501_0047_0000$$$::I struggle to suppress the impulse, and ask,[lr]::
56923::$$$message_0501_0047_0001$$$::"Like what?"[lr]::
56924::$$$message_0501_0047_0002$$$::I press him to get to the point.::
56925::$$$message_0501_0048_0000$$$::"Sakura Matou collapsed, and Rin tried to save her. But Rider prevented her from doing so, correct?[lr]::
56926::$$$message_0501_0048_0001$$$::That makes the rule clear: she had to continue to fight as a Master. That condition kept the Crest Worms in check."::
56927::$$$message_0501_0049_0000$$$::"Previously, she had consented to letting Shinji Matou command Rider. But now that she refuses, the Crest Worms are attacking her. They've calmed down for now, but the more time passes, the more they will harm her.[lr]::
56928::$$$message_0501_0049_0001$$$::As if they're demanding, 'what are you doing?[lr]::
56929::$$$message_0501_0049_0002$$$::If you're a Master, hurry up and kill them.[lr]::
56930::$$$message_0501_0049_0003$$$::If you can't, then we'll devour you.'"::
56931::$$$message_0501_0050_0000$$$::"...So she was bound by that rule?"[lr]::
56932::$$$message_0501_0050_0001$$$::"It appears to be the only likely possibility."[lr]::
56933::$$$message_0501_0050_0002$$$::"Then...! Then she can just stop being a Master. If she uses up her Command Spells and nullifies her pact with her Servant, she won't be a Master anymore, so..."::
56934::$$$message_0501_0051_0000$$$::"That is inadvisable.[lr]::
56935::$$$message_0501_0051_0001$$$::I told you that the condition which activates the Crest Worms is if she abandons her duties as a Master.[lr]::
56936::$$$message_0501_0051_0002$$$::If she were to sever her contract with Rider, then the Crest Worms would most certainly consume her."::
56937::$$$message_0501_0052_0000$$$::"Yeah. Right now, Sakura's only options are to fight and survive, or not fight and let the Crest Worms kill her."::
56938::$$$message_0501_0053_0000$$$::"It appears so. As long as the Holy Grail War continues, the Crest Worms will continue to attack their host.[lr]::
56939::$$$message_0501_0053_0001$$$::If that continues, Sakura Matou's mind won't remain intact, never mind her body. She has Magic Crests distributed throughout her body, after all.[lr]::
56940::$$$message_0501_0053_0002$$$::I'm sure you know how absurd that is, Rin."::
56941::$$$message_0501_0054_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I should be used to it by now, but sometimes I want to cut off my whole dang arm.[lr]::
56942::$$$message_0501_0054_0001$$$::It's bad enough having it only in my left arm. If I had crests throughout my whole body, then my bodily functions would erode.[lr]::
56943::$$$message_0501_0054_0002$$$::That would make someone more like a clump of Magic Circuits than a mage. The waves of magical energy would rewrite your brain."::
56944::$$$message_0501_0055_0000$$$::"Wha... Then, Sakura is..."[lr]::
56945::$$$message_0501_0055_0001$$$::"If her current condition continues, it will endanger her life.[lr]::
56946::$$$message_0501_0055_0002$$$::I don't know how long she'll last, but the Crest Worms encroach more with each passing day. She'll die if they can't be removed before they spread throughout her entire body, though they may cause permanent damage before then."::
56947::$$$message_0501_0056_0000$$$::"All I've done is cleanse her.[lr]::
56948::$$$message_0501_0056_0001$$$::The next procedure will aim to restore her lost magical energy and mind, but the chances of success are low.[lr]::
56949::$$$message_0501_0056_0002$$$::   That's all I have to say.[lr]::
56950::$$$message_0501_0056_0003$$$::My conclusion is that at this rate, Sakura Matou cannot be saved. Can you accept that, Shirou Emiya?"::
56951::$$$message_0501_0057_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56952::$$$message_0501_0057_0001$$$::The hell I can.[lr]::
56953::$$$message_0501_0057_0002$$$::We can't save Sakura?[lr]::
56954::$$$message_0501_0057_0003$$$::That's crazy.[lr]::
56955::$$$message_0501_0057_0004$$$::She was doing just fine until yesterday, so why is this happening now...!?::
56956::$$$message_0501_0058_0000$$$::"You said we need to eliminate the worms. You can't extract them?[lr]::
56957::$$$message_0501_0058_0001$$$::If you know there's something foreign inside her, shouldn't you take it out!?"::
56958::$$$message_0501_0059_0000$$$::"Extraction would be difficult. The Crest Worms have already become Magic Circuits which are part of her body. I am trained in Crest transplantation, but I cannot dispel her of those things.[lr]::
56959::$$$message_0501_0059_0001$$$::...Ah, yes. If you still want to extract them, then you will need to rely on a miracle."::
56960::$$$message_0501_0060_0000$$$::"Rrgh..."[lr]::
56961::$$$message_0501_0060_0001$$$::The Holy Grail.[lr]::
56962::$$$message_0501_0060_0002$$$::So it all comes back to that.[lr]::
56963::$$$message_0501_0060_0003$$$::Sakura has no choice but to fight as a Master,[lr]::
56964::$$$message_0501_0060_0004$$$::and only the power of the grail can save her?::
56965::$$$message_0501_0061_0000$$$::"We've got the gist of things, Kirei. Thanks."[lr]::
56966::$$$message_0501_0061_0001$$$::Tohsaka gives the priest a perfunctory bow of gratitude.::
56967::$$$message_0501_0062_0000$$$::"But isn't this happening way too fast? It isn't like the worms got implanted today or yesterday. Why is she suddenly at her breaking point?"::
56968::$$$message_0501_0063_0000$$$::"Must you ask?[lr]::
56969::$$$message_0501_0063_0001$$$::The Crest Worms were given to her years ago. She even lost her Tohsaka eye and hair colors, so the modifications must have begun at an early age. The changes did not start recently."::
56970::$$$message_0501_0064_0000$$$::"Though, they must not have been as destructive as what we're seeing now.[lr]::
56971::$$$message_0501_0064_0001$$$::It appears that Zouken did not intend to use Sakura in this war. They aren't configured for combat, to begin with. I can only presume that some unforeseen conditions must have aligned for him to treat her this way."::
56972::$$$message_0501_0065_0000$$$::"Unforeseen conditions, huh... I don't know what those are, but are you saying that Zouken didn't favor Sakura until the last few days?"::
56973::$$$message_0501_0066_0000$$$::"Most likely. I believe that Zouken noticed some unexpected change in Sakura.[lr]::
56974::$$$message_0501_0066_0001$$$::But it is only one reason. There must be other causes for her sudden changes.[lr]::
56975::$$$message_0501_0066_0002$$$::Once she began using a Servant, it would have constantly consumed her magical energy. If she became unable to feed her Crest Worms as well, what do you think the starved worms would do?"::
56976::$$$message_0501_0067_0000$$$::"...I see. So her body's deteriorating because she lacks magical energy, regardless of the condition not to fight as a Master.[lr]::
56977::$$$message_0501_0067_0001$$$::So if she at least stops using Rider and reduces that energy cost..."::
56978::$$$message_0501_0068_0000$$$::"Yes, she may be able to continue her daily life.[lr]::
56979::$$$message_0501_0068_0001$$$::Of course, I doubt the old man would allow it."::
56980::$$$message_0501_0069_0000$$$::"...Yeah. He wouldn't have implanted Crest Worms in her otherwise.[lr]::
56981::$$$message_0501_0069_0001$$$::They'll take over her body if she doesn't fight,[lr]::
56982::$$$message_0501_0069_0002$$$::but if she does fight, she'll use magical energy and her body will erode away.[lr]::
56983::$$$message_0501_0069_0003$$$::...And that's not all. Zouken can use Sakura any way he wishes, if he so chooses."::
56984::$$$message_0501_0070_0000$$$::"Use Sakura...?"[lr]::
56985::$$$message_0501_0070_0001$$$::"Yeah. Her life is in his hands. So, the only way to save Sakura is to defeat Zouken.[lr]::
56986::$$$message_0501_0070_0002$$$::But, Emiya...[lr]::
56987::$$$message_0501_0070_0003$$$::If you want to defeat Zouken, you'll have to fight Sakura, too. She's like his puppet. You can count on Zouken using her as a shield if he's cornered."::
56988::$$$message_0501_0071_0000$$$::"Correct. Sakura Matou is a convenient pawn to Zouken. He will manipulate her, just as he did Shinji Matou.[lr]::
56989::$$$message_0501_0071_0001$$$::In fact, her powers as a Master exceed his. She can be driven by the worms to go on a rampage, just as Zouken desires."[lr]::
56990::$$$message_0501_0071_0002$$$::"...Rrgh."::
56991::$$$message_0501_0072_0000$$$::"...However, the thought of playing into his hands doesn't sit well with me either.[lr]::
56992::$$$message_0501_0072_0001$$$::I will continue to perform surgeries on Sakura Matou. Right now, I've purged her of the drug and given her anesthesia. Next, I will focus on extracting the worms and helping her body recover."::
56993::$$$message_0501_0073_0000$$$::"Huh? Wait, Kirei, you..."[lr]::
56994::$$$message_0501_0073_0001$$$::"They are desperate measures, but I will do what I can. I cannot let Sakura Matou die this way. It would sully my image as a priest seeking a divine miracle."::
56995::$$$message_0501_0074_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
56996::$$$message_0501_0074_0001$$$::I'm right there with Tohsaka.[lr]::
56997::$$$message_0501_0074_0002$$$::I haven't known Kotomine as long, but I didn't expect this from him at all.[lr]::
56998::$$$message_0501_0074_0003$$$::...It's not just a hunch.[lr]::
56999::$$$message_0501_0074_0004$$$::I can tell that Kotomine sincerely and seriously intends to save Sakura.[lr]::
57000::$$$message_0501_0074_0005$$$::It might be a matter of course for a priest, but I still feel like I'm witnessing something inconceivable.::
57001::$$$message_0501_0075_0000$$$::"...Did hell just freeze over? I've never seen you go to such lengths for someone else."[lr]::
57002::$$$message_0501_0075_0001$$$::"It is no mere whim. It would frustrate me to see her die.[lr]::
57003::$$$message_0501_0075_0002$$$::Of course, perhaps you would prefer it if there was one less person to deal with."::
57004::$$$message_0501_0076_0000$$$::The priest answers dispassionately.[lr]::
57005::$$$message_0501_0076_0001$$$::Tohsaka glares at him for a moment.[lr]::
57006::$$$message_0501_0076_0002$$$::"I'll leave that to you. I'll be back once the surgery is done."[lr]::
57007::$$$message_0501_0076_0003$$$::She remarks, and leaves the church.::
57008::$$$message_0501_0077_0000$$$::The church returns to silence, now that Tohsaka's gone.[lr]::
57009::$$$message_0501_0077_0001$$$::The priest silently watches her go, while I stay seated, with nothing else to do.::
57010::$$$message_0501_0078_0000$$$::"What are you doing? You won't be useful here. I don't want you in the way, so go kill some time until the surgery is finished."[lr]::
57011::$$$message_0501_0078_0001$$$::"I won't get in your way. I trust you with the surgery. You healed that woman before."::
57012::$$$message_0501_0079_0000$$$::"Hmph. The scale of the work to be done can hardly be compared to before.[lr]::
57013::$$$message_0501_0079_0001$$$::Sakura Matou stopped her rampage by attacking herself. She likely poisoned herself after she attacked you. To put it simply, she attacked her own mind to stop Zouken from controlling her."::
57014::$$$message_0501_0080_0000$$$::"This surgery is akin to restarting a stopped heart... However, the stalled Crest Worms are keeping the body alive. If I can revive her mind, I will consider it a success."::
57015::$$$message_0501_0081_0000$$$::"But if you are there, it will hinder my work. It would be a problem if you blundered into the room upon hearing her suffer, and first of all, you have no obligation to bear that burden. Sakura Matou is a stranger to you."::
57016::$$$message_0501_0082_0000$$$::"A stranger?"[lr]::
57017::$$$message_0501_0082_0001$$$::"You should not sympathize with her.[lr]::
57018::$$$message_0501_0082_0002$$$::There is nothing you can do. Just as Rin did, it's best if you leave quickly."::
57019::$$$message_0501_0083_0000$$$::"Why? If I can't do anything to help, at least I can pray that she'll be all right."[lr]::
57020::$$$message_0501_0083_0001$$$::"That would be a sin. You do not have the right to share in her pain.[lr]::
57021::$$$message_0501_0083_0002$$$::You still don't understand? I'm saying that if you are here, it will cause the surgery to fail. To Sakura Matou right now, Shirou Emiya is nothing but an enemy."::
57022::$$$message_0501_0084_0000$$$::"Wh..."[lr]::
57023::$$$message_0501_0084_0001$$$::I can't even ask why.[lr]::
57024::$$$message_0501_0084_0002$$$::The priest's heavy words point out a sin that I didn't even realize.::
57025::$$$message_0501_0085_0000$$$::"Sakura Matou feels guilt towards you. She will refuse to wake up if you are by her side."[lr]::
57026::$$$message_0501_0085_0001$$$::"She feels...guilty?"::
57027::$$$message_0501_0086_0000$$$::"Yes. Although it is more like repentance than guilt.[lr]::
57028::$$$message_0501_0086_0001$$$::...As the Matou heir, she has been subject to years of experimentation.[lr]::
57029::$$$message_0501_0086_0002$$$::It isn't difficult to imagine what sort of education Zouken had in store for her. Sakura Matou is not the chaste maiden you wish her to be, but a foul witch sullied by his worms."::
57030::$$$message_0501_0087_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
57031::$$$message_0501_0087_0001$$$::...That doesn't surprise me.[lr]::
57032::$$$message_0501_0087_0002$$$::I know the feeling now.[lr]::
57033::$$$message_0501_0087_0003$$$::The moment I found out Sakura is a Master.[lr]::
57034::$$$message_0501_0087_0004$$$::When the Command Spell appeared on her hand, I silently accepted reality.::
57035::$$$message_0501_0088_0000$$$::"While she tried to keep the truth from you, she always sought salvation.[lr]::
57036::$$$message_0501_0088_0001$$$::I don't know how long she has had to endure such torture in the name of magical inheritance."::
57037::$$$message_0501_0089_0000$$$::"But what could people close to her do, knowing nothing of her plight?[lr]::
57038::$$$message_0501_0089_0001$$$::That is why you are not even qualified to pray for her. If you still care about Sakura Matou, then leave. That is all you can do right now."::
57039::$$$message_0501_0090_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57040::$$$message_0501_0090_0001$$$::...I stand up.[lr]::
57041::$$$message_0501_0090_0002$$$::It's not because I lost an argument with this guy.[lr]::
57042::$$$message_0501_0090_0003$$$::I'm just acknowledging that what he says is true.[lr]::
57043::$$$message_0501_0090_0004$$$::If I really care about Sakura, then I shouldn't be here.[lr]::
57044::$$$message_0501_0090_0005$$$::This thoughtless brain of mine shouldn't try to care for Sakura.::
57045::$$$message_0501_0091_0000$$$::I turn my back on the priest and start walking out of the church.[lr]::
57046::$$$message_0501_0091_0001$$$::"Good. One more thing, though it may not need saying..."[lr]::
57047::$$$message_0501_0091_0002$$$::I don't bother turning around.[lr]::
57048::$$$message_0501_0091_0003$$$::I stop in front of the exit.::
57049::$$$message_0501_0092_0000$$$::"You mentioned the female victim from before, when Shinji Matou still commanded Rider. She was basically a dead woman, but your quick thinking saved her."::
57050::$$$message_0501_0093_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
57051::$$$message_0501_0093_0001$$$::My temper rises.[lr]::
57052::$$$message_0501_0093_0002$$$::Why do I immediately realize the reason he's telling me this?::
57053::$$$message_0501_0094_0000$$$::"That's right. I don't need to spell out whose wrongdoing it was. When a Servant attacks a human, the responsibility lies with its Master."::
57054::$$$message_0501_0095_0000$$$::"You're...you're saying that it was Sakura's fault?"[lr]::
57055::$$$message_0501_0095_0001$$$::"Not at all. I am merely assigning responsibility, not discussing morality. You saved the woman, and that is a fact."::
57056::$$$message_0501_0096_0000$$$::But if...[lr]::
57057::$$$message_0501_0096_0001$$$::If I had made the wrong choice back there, Rider would've killed the woman.::
57058::$$$message_0501_0097_0000$$$::And that would be...[lr]::
57059::$$$message_0501_0097_0001$$$::"Let us discuss this another time, Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
57060::$$$message_0501_0097_0002$$$::Even if Sakura Matou recovers, the outcome will not change.[lr]::
57061::$$$message_0501_0097_0003$$$::Even if she regains her sanity, the same thing will happen again.[lr]::
57062::$$$message_0501_0097_0004$$$::When it does...who will you protect?"[lr]::
57063::$$$message_0501_0097_0005$$$::  I don't know when Sakura will do that again.::

57065::$$$message_0501_0098_0001$$$::I don't have an answer for him.[lr]::
57066::$$$message_0501_0098_0002$$$::I walk quickly to the exit, like I'm running away from his words.::
57067::$$$message_0501_0099_0000$$$::"Shirou Emiya. Do you remember why you became a Master?"::
57068::$$$message_0501_0100_0000$$$::I gnash my teeth as I walk.[lr]::
57069::$$$message_0501_0100_0001$$$::His words are an ultimatum.::
57070::$$$message_0501_0101_0000$$$::"You said that you would do the right thing.[lr]::
57071::$$$message_0501_0101_0001$$$::Then you must make a decision.[lr]::
57072::$$$message_0501_0101_0002$$$::Will you kill yourself to stay true to your ideals and convictions...just as Kiritsugu Emiya did?"::
57073::$$$message_0501_0102_0000$$$::I shut the door.[lr]::
57074::$$$message_0501_0102_0001$$$::The door to God's house is as heavy as the cross He bore.::
