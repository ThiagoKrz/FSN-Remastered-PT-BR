43835::$$$message_0390_0000_0001$$$::If there's a way to resolve this without killing, is it so wrong to wish for it?[lr]::
43836::$$$message_0390_0000_0002$$$::I don't mind being called naïve.[lr]::
43837::$$$message_0390_0000_0003$$$::And I know I'm a hypocrite.::
43838::$$$message_0390_0001_0000$$$::To a Master, defeating your opponent means killing them.[lr]::
43839::$$$message_0390_0001_0001$$$::They're all aware of this fact before getting themselves involved thus far.[lr]::
43840::$$$message_0390_0001_0002$$$::They chose to fight knowing they will have to kill or be killed trying.[lr]::
43841::$$$message_0390_0001_0003$$$::I know how much of a coward I am for wanting to step in and stop them from fighting.::
43842::$$$message_0390_0002_0000$$$::And yet...[lr]::

43845::$$$message_0390_0003_0001$$$::I try to stop them while enduring my headache.[lr]::
43846::$$$message_0390_0003_0002$$$::In that moment.[lr]::
43847::$$$message_0390_0003_0003$$$::Kuzuki makes his move.::
43848::$$$message_0390_0004_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
43849::$$$message_0390_0004_0001$$$::Maybe my move gave him an opening. Kuzuki shortens the distance between him and Archer in an instant, and strikes right between his eyes.::
43850::$$$message_0390_0005_0000$$$::A strike that would've shattered anyone's skull, yet Archer decided not to dodge the deadly attack.[lr]::
43851::$$$message_0390_0005_0001$$$::A sound can be heard as the attack makes contact with Archer's head.[lr]::
43852::$$$message_0390_0005_0002$$$::The red knight chose to withstand Kuzuki's strike…[lr]::
43853::$$$message_0390_0005_0003$$$::and used the opportunity to pierce through Kuzuki's chest.::
