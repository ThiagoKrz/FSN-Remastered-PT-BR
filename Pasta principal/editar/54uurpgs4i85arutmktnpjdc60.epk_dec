70075::$$$message_0641_0000_0000$$$::    We go out into the yard.[lr]::
70076::$$$message_0641_0000_0001$$$::The entire world is cloaked in shadow.[lr]::
70077::$$$message_0641_0000_0002$$$::My entire body shivers with mind-numbing awe and fear, down to my fingertips.::
70078::$$$message_0641_0001_0000$$$::...The black Shadow is before us.[lr]::
70079::$$$message_0641_0001_0001$$$::If it wanted to, it could crush us along with the entire house.[lr]::
70080::$$$message_0641_0001_0002$$$::The difference in power is clear.[lr]::
70081::$$$message_0641_0001_0003$$$::It's transformed into a state unlike anything we've seen.::
70082::$$$message_0641_0002_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
70083::$$$message_0641_0002_0001$$$::...That Shadow does nothing.[lr]::
70084::$$$message_0641_0002_0002$$$::It isn't Sakura, but the Shadow shaped like her.[lr]::
70085::$$$message_0641_0002_0003$$$::The real Sakura is underground, beneath Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
70086::$$$message_0641_0002_0004$$$::The thing quivering in front of us is a false image modeled after her.::
70087::$$$message_0641_0003_0000$$$::"...Hmph. Couldn't even bother to come in person, huh? You've gotten a big head in the short time we haven't seen you, Sakura."[lr]::
70088::$$$message_0641_0003_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
70089::$$$message_0641_0003_0002$$$::I'm not sure if it isn't hearing Tohsaka's taunts, or if it can't hear our words at all.[lr]::
70090::$$$message_0641_0003_0003$$$::Sakura's shadow sways in the moonlight. It looks terribly lonely.::
70091::$$$message_0641_0004_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
70092::$$$message_0641_0004_0001$$$::Its eyes are definitely looking at me.[lr]::
70093::$$$message_0641_0004_0002$$$::"Senpai," it says.[lr]::
70094::$$$message_0641_0004_0003$$$::It looks so meek, that it might actually respond like Sakura always does if I hold out my hand.::
70095::$$$message_0641_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
70096::$$$message_0641_0005_0001$$$::But I don't.[lr]::
70097::$$$message_0641_0005_0002$$$::I know what I have to do.[lr]::
70098::$$$message_0641_0005_0003$$$::I can't call out to Sakura and risk weakening my resolve.::
70099::$$$message_0641_0006_0000$$$::I look away.[lr]::
70100::$$$message_0641_0006_0001$$$::Sakura's shadow seems hurt.[lr]::
70101::$$$message_0641_0006_0002$$$::"Did you hear everything from Illyasviel, Nee-san?"[lr]::
70102::$$$message_0641_0006_0003$$$::The Shadow faces Tohsaka, speaking in a cold, scornful tone.::
70103::$$$message_0641_0007_0000$$$::"I did. We know what's possessing you, and the abilities of the thing about to be born from the Holy Grail.[lr]::
70104::$$$message_0641_0007_0001$$$::So, Sakura, let me ask you this: Do you plan to cut your ties with AÅ‹ra Mainiiu?"[lr]::
70105::$$$message_0641_0007_0002$$$::Tohsaka's voice sounds the same.[lr]::
70106::$$$message_0641_0007_0003$$$::Her voice is cool, condescending, and thoroughly unimpressed.::
70107::$$$message_0641_0008_0000$$$::"No. I said the weak me is gone now, remember? I suffered so much for this power. I don't want to leave it, nor can I.[lr]::
70108::$$$message_0641_0008_0001$$$::...This is the only way for me to live."::
70109::$$$message_0641_0009_0000$$$::"Okay. One more question.[lr]::
70110::$$$message_0641_0009_0001$$$::How's your precious Servant coming along? Illya said it should be almost ready, but how do you feel as a mother? Is it outside already?"::
70111::$$$message_0641_0010_0000$$$::"...Of course not. If that thing comes out, it'll devour the entire town in a flash.[lr]::
70112::$$$message_0641_0010_0001$$$::I won't let that happen. Senpai is still here.[lr]::
70113::$$$message_0641_0010_0002$$$::So, as long as I'm here, I won't let that child out."::
70114::$$$message_0641_0011_0000$$$::"Oh. So we don't need to rush. As long as Shirou is with me, you'll keep AÅ‹ra Mainiiu in check.[lr]::
70115::$$$message_0641_0011_0001$$$::Isn't that nice, Shirou? Sakura's still doing just fine."::
70116::$$$message_0641_0012_0000$$$::"...Stop messing around. You know I can't hold on much longer, don't you?[lr]::
70117::$$$message_0641_0012_0001$$$::You need to take Senpai and run. I don't have much time left. I don't know when I might disappear. Tonight might be the last night I stay myself."::
70118::$$$message_0641_0013_0000$$$::"That's why I'm here to warn you.[lr]::
70119::$$$message_0641_0013_0001$$$::...Nee-san, take Senpai and run somewhere far away. If you can do that, then I feel safe taking the child down with me."::
70120::$$$message_0641_0014_0000$$$::Sakura said she'd take it down with her.[lr]::
70121::$$$message_0641_0014_0001$$$::Tohsaka's shoulders tremble slightly.[lr]::
70122::$$$message_0641_0014_0002$$$::Does she believe Sakura, or...::
70123::$$$message_0641_0015_0000$$$::"...Hmph. You say you don't know when you'll disappear.[lr]::
70124::$$$message_0641_0015_0001$$$::You're mistaking that for not knowing when you won't be able to hold back, Sakura."[lr]::
70125::$$$message_0641_0015_0002$$$::"Nee-san..."::
70126::$$$message_0641_0016_0000$$$::"Fine, whatever. I don't know how you plan to take AÅ‹ra Mainiiu down with you, but you'll be free to kill yourself if Shirou and I leave, right?[lr]::
70127::$$$message_0641_0016_0001$$$::You'll die for us, along with the Servants in the Holy Grail, whose power you've inherited."::
70128::$$$message_0641_0017_0000$$$::"...Y-yes. So please run.[lr]::
70129::$$$message_0641_0017_0001$$$::I... I don't want you to see me change. I'll be okay as long as Senpai... as long as Senpai goes away.[lr]::
70130::$$$message_0641_0017_0002$$$::So please don't chase after me anymore."::
70131::$$$message_0641_0018_0000$$$::She makes a determined plea.[lr]::
70132::$$$message_0641_0018_0001$$$::Sakura's shadow could kill me at any second, but she's earnestly asking me not to chase after her.::
70133::$$$message_0641_0019_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
70134::$$$message_0641_0019_0001$$$::I can't honor that wish.[lr]::
70135::$$$message_0641_0019_0002$$$::I refuse to leave her and run, and I won't let her kill herself either.[lr]::
70136::$$$message_0641_0019_0003$$$::And so...[lr]::
70137::$$$message_0641_0019_0004$$$::"We're going over there. We're coming to kill you."[lr]::
70138::$$$message_0641_0019_0005$$$::Tohsaka severs ties with her blood sister.::
70139::$$$message_0641_0020_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
70140::$$$message_0641_0020_0001$$$::"Makes sense, doesn't it? As the Tohsaka mage, I can't let you be. I also don't trust you to kill yourself.[lr]::
70141::$$$message_0641_0020_0002$$$::Have you noticed how you don't make any sense, Sakura? You're telling me to run, even though you want to kill me.[lr]::
70142::$$$message_0641_0020_0003$$$::Honestly, you're such a goody-two-shoes in front of Shirou."::
70143::$$$message_0641_0021_0000$$$::"What...did you say..."[lr]::
70144::$$$message_0641_0021_0001$$$::"Now that's a nice face. You should've worn that from the beginning.[lr]::
70145::$$$message_0641_0021_0002$$$::Is that all you came to say? Then get out of here. Take your time; we're coming for you soon.[lr]::
70146::$$$message_0641_0021_0003$$$::Listen, Sakura. I'll be the one to kill you, and no one else."::
70147::$$$message_0641_0022_0000$$$::Tohsaka declares in a gentle voice.[lr]::
70148::$$$message_0641_0022_0001$$$::...The shadow quivers.[lr]::
70149::$$$message_0641_0022_0002$$$::For a moment, Sakura's projection freezes like a statue.[lr]::
70150::$$$message_0641_0022_0003$$$::"Yes... I'll be waiting for you, Nee-san."[lr]::
70151::$$$message_0641_0022_0004$$$::She lets out a lurid giggle and disappears.::
70152::$$$message_0641_0023_0000$$$::The shadows covering the house are gone.[lr]::
70153::$$$message_0641_0023_0001$$$::Only Tohsaka and I are left standing in the yard.::
70154::$$$message_0641_0024_0000$$$::    I feel dizzy.[lr]::
70155::$$$message_0641_0024_0001$$$::I meant to keep my focus, but seeing Sakura apparently shook me.[lr]::
70156::$$$message_0641_0024_0002$$$::...It seems that Sakura isn't the only one running out of time.::
70157::$$$message_0641_0025_0000$$$::"...Shirou.[lr]::
70158::$$$message_0641_0025_0001$$$::You heard Sakura. What about you?[lr]::
70159::$$$message_0641_0025_0002$$$::I won't stop you if you want to leave town. I'll be taking the Jeweled Sword first, though."::
70160::$$$message_0641_0026_0000$$$::"You don't need to ask. I'm going to keep fighting, and I'll Project that sword for you.[lr]::
70161::$$$message_0641_0026_0001$$$::We're working together, remember? I'll back you up when there's anything you can't do."::
70162::$$$message_0641_0027_0000$$$::"...Okay, that's fine. Do you get it, though, Shirou?[lr]::
70163::$$$message_0641_0027_0001$$$::Going with me means killing Sakura. That goes for the Jeweled Sword, too. You need to provide me with a weapon to kill her."::
70164::$$$message_0641_0028_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I'm definitely contradicting myself by making the Jeweled Sword. But we can't beat Sakura right now, and I already promised that I'd make it. If you need me to Project the Jeweled Sword to fight Sakura's Shadow, then it has to be done."::
70165::$$$message_0641_0029_0000$$$::"Huh... So, you're..."[lr]::
70166::$$$message_0641_0029_0001$$$::"Yeah, I'm the opposite of you. I'm going to save Sakura and end this war. I promised that I'd be her hero."::
70167::$$$message_0641_0030_0000$$$::"Even though letting Sakura live means you're going to kill everyone else?"[lr]::
70168::$$$message_0641_0030_0001$$$::"That isn't set in stone yet. There should be a way to help Sakura without causing any more deaths."::
70169::$$$message_0641_0031_0000$$$::"...I'm not so sure. Sakura's already killed many people. Is saving someone like that still what you'd call being a hero, Shirou?"[lr]::
70170::$$$message_0641_0031_0001$$$::    She alludes to something critical.[lr]::
70171::$$$message_0641_0031_0002$$$::It's an inescapable sin.[lr]::
70172::$$$message_0641_0031_0003$$$::Her words drive into my chest, and I finally say...::
70173::$$$message_0641_0032_0000$$$::"...Yeah. I'll protect Sakura, even if she stops being human. I'll protect her from everything, including the version of her that wants to kill herself.[lr]::
70174::$$$message_0641_0032_0001$$$::That's all I want to do. That's what it means to be on her side."[lr]::
70175::$$$message_0641_0032_0002$$$::I proudly voice my feelings.::
70176::$$$message_0641_0033_0000$$$::"...Haah. You're so shameless."[lr]::
70177::$$$message_0641_0033_0001$$$::I nod, shamelessly.::
70178::$$$message_0641_0034_0000$$$::"...Okay. I didn't think you'd listen to me, but you're this stubborn? Honestly, I give up."[lr]::
70179::$$$message_0641_0034_0001$$$::"Huh? Where are you going, Tohsaka?"::
70180::$$$message_0641_0035_0000$$$::"I need to get ready to fight, obviously.[lr]::
70181::$$$message_0641_0035_0001$$$::Sakura warned us because she really is at her wit's end. We need to hurry."[lr]::
70182::$$$message_0641_0035_0002$$$::"W-well, yeah, but we're not done talk[line2]"::
70183::$$$message_0641_0036_0000$$$::"The conversation's over. You said that you'll protect Sakura as long as you live.[lr]::
70184::$$$message_0641_0036_0001$$$::...Hmph. Fine, I won't say anything about it anymore. Go struggle as much as you want."::
70185::$$$message_0641_0037_0000$$$::"Hm...?"[lr]::
70186::$$$message_0641_0037_0001$$$::Where did all her tension go? Tohsaka seems to be pouting, strangely enough.::
70187::$$$message_0641_0038_0000$$$::"But don't get the wrong idea. This is our deal to have you make the Jeweled Sword.[lr]::
70188::$$$message_0641_0038_0001$$$::As long as you keep trying, I'll let you decide how to deal with Sakura. I won't step in until you can't move anymore.[lr]::
70189::$$$message_0641_0038_0002$$$::...No complaints there, right? You might be able to save her if you work hard enough."::
70190::$$$message_0641_0039_0000$$$::With that parting remark, Tohsaka goes off to the guesthouse.[lr]::
70191::$$$message_0641_0039_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
70192::$$$message_0641_0039_0002$$$::As I watch her leave, a big part of the anxiety gripping my chest seems to melt away.[lr]::
70193::$$$message_0641_0039_0003$$$::We're thinking in opposite directions.[lr]::
70194::$$$message_0641_0039_0004$$$::But Tohsaka still wants to help Sakura.::
70195::$$$message_0641_0040_0000$$$::And she feels comfortable trusting me to do it.[lr]::
70196::$$$message_0641_0040_0001$$$::We both love Sakura.[lr]::
70197::$$$message_0641_0040_0002$$$::I think Tohsaka will be able to help her start over.:ð5ó
