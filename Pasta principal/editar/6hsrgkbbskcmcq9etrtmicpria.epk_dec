57347::$$$message_0510_0000_0000$$$::Tohsaka's the only person I can ask about Shinji.[lr]::
57348::$$$message_0510_0000_0001$$$::No, the bigger problem is how Sakura was hurt this morning, but that makes it about Shinji, too...::
57349::$$$message_0510_0001_0000$$$::"Fine. If you wanna settle things now, then let's go. I can't believe you came to school without your Servant[line2]"[lr]::
57350::$$$message_0510_0001_0001$$$::"Sorry! I'm begging you, Tohsaka, give me your advice!"[lr]::
57351::$$$message_0510_0001_0002$$$::I close in Tohsaka until I've got her backed up against a wall.[lr]::
57352::$$$message_0510_0001_0003$$$::Given the subject matter, I can't let the students around us hear.::
57353::$$$message_0510_0002_0000$$$::"H-hold on, what are you thinking!? I was just putting you on, but there's a lot of people still around!"::
57354::$$$message_0510_0003_0000$$$::"Please! You're the only one I can count on. I don't know how to stop her from getting sucked into the Holy Grail War. You know a lot of stuff, so can you think of a way to protect her!?"[lr]::

57356::$$$message_0510_0004_0000$$$::Tohsaka stares at me for a moment, flabbergasted.[lr]::
57357::$$$message_0510_0004_0001$$$::"Ah... S-sorry. You had such perfect timing, I lost my cool.[lr]::
57358::$$$message_0510_0004_0002$$$::Right, um, so Sakura's this first-year I know, and I feel like she's going to get mixed up in the Holy Grail War. I want to do something about that, but I don't have any good ideas, and[line2]"::
57359::$$$message_0510_0005_0000$$$::"I don't need your excuses. Do you mind backing up now?[lr]::
57360::$$$message_0510_0005_0001$$$::Homeroom's about to start."[lr]::
57361::$$$message_0510_0005_0002$$$::"...! M-my bad, I didn't realize!"::
57362::$$$message_0510_0006_0000$$$::I scramble back from Tohsaka.[lr]::
57363::$$$message_0510_0006_0001$$$::...Belatedly, I come to my senses while my cheeks go beet red.[lr]::
57364::$$$message_0510_0006_0002$$$::What was I thinking, cornering her against a wall like that!?::
57365::$$$message_0510_0007_0000$$$::"...I'm sorry. I know it's really pushing it, but hear me out. I[line2]"[lr]::
57366::$$$message_0510_0007_0001$$$::"You need advice, right? Fine, I'll listen."[lr]::
57367::$$$message_0510_0007_0002$$$::"Eh? R-really, Tohsaka!?"[lr]::
57368::$$$message_0510_0007_0003$$$::"...Did you really expect me to say no when you were making a face like you'd die if I turned you down?  The roof, at lunchtime. We'll talk then."[lr]::
57369::$$$message_0510_0007_0004$$$::Tohsaka turns on her heel and goes up the stairs.::
57370::$$$message_0510_0008_0000$$$::I stare after her in shock for a moment, when,[lr]::
57371::$$$message_0510_0008_0001$$$::"Hey, stupid. You'll be late if you don't get going."[lr]::
57372::$$$message_0510_0008_0002$$$::she leaves me with those words, in a vaguely pouting tone.:‹½~
