40611::$$$message_0352_0000_0000$$$::...It'll end up just like today if we fight them head-on.[lr]::
40612::$$$message_0352_0000_0001$$$::Since we are inferior in terms of fighting ability, we can only execute a surprise attack on Caster's blind spot in order to win.::
40613::$$$message_0352_0001_0000$$$::"Hey. You said that you're like Kotomine's student, right? Then aren't you knowledgable about that church?"::
40614::$$$message_0352_0002_0000$$$::"Huh? Well I have stayed over at the church several times... Oh, I see.[lr]::
40615::$$$message_0352_0002_0001$$$::Sorry to rain on your parade, but there's no secret passage in that church. That was the first time I saw that underground sanctuary. Even if there is one, only Kotomine would know."::
40616::$$$message_0352_0003_0000$$$::"Man, I give up... Damn, I knew it wouldn't be that convenient. Knowing that priest, I had assumed he would have prepared at least that much."::
40617::$$$message_0352_0004_0000$$$::"Yeah. But as long as we can't use it, we have to come up with another way... Um, this is a hypothetical idea, but can you hear me out?"[lr]::
40618::$$$message_0352_0004_0001$$$::"Yeah, I will... Do you have an idea?"::
40619::$$$message_0352_0005_0000$$$::"Yes. Look Shirou, it's obvious that I can't beat Caster by myself, right? Then, a simple plan would be to increase our force.[lr]::
40620::$$$message_0352_0005_0001$$$::They have three Servants in their possession, so we need to have at least one Servant on our side too."::
40621::$$$message_0352_0006_0000$$$::"Well, that's true, but... By increasing our force...[lr]::
40622::$$$message_0352_0006_0001$$$::Do you mean we're going to ask the other Masters for their help?"[lr]::
40623::$$$message_0352_0006_0002$$$::"Not for help, but a cooperation. With Caster becoming that strong, the other Masters can't keep quiet either, right?[lr]::
40624::$$$message_0352_0006_0003$$$::If they want the Holy Grail, we need to cooperate to defeat the strongest opponent, and then we can go back to being solo after that.[lr]::
40625::$$$message_0352_0006_0004$$$::This is a standard tactic in battle royale, right?"::
40626::$$$message_0352_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40627::$$$message_0352_0007_0001$$$::So we'll make an alliance with the remaining Masters to defeat Caster's operation that has become too powerful, right?::
40628::$$$message_0352_0008_0000$$$::"...I see. We might be able to make a truce depending on how the negotiations go.[lr]::
40629::$$$message_0352_0008_0001$$$::In that case..."::
40630::$$$message_0352_0009_0000$$$:: "Yes, there are two Masters left... Lancer's Master and Berserker's Master.[lr]::
40631::$$$message_0352_0009_0001$$$::...Lancer's Master is still unknown so there's no way to negotiate, but we might have a chance with Berserker's Master, Illyasviel."::
40632::$$$message_0352_0010_0000$$$::Berserker's Master.[lr]::
40633::$$$message_0352_0010_0001$$$::The girl in white and the rock-like giant I met on the first day.[lr]::
40634::$$$message_0352_0010_0002$$$::Her actions were dangerous, but I don't think she's cruel.::
40635::$$$message_0352_0011_0000$$$::"...Yeah, that girl might at least listen to us. She doesn't seem like she would propose any absurd conditions in return either."::
40636::$$$message_0352_0012_0000$$$::"...Idiot. She's the most dangerous for you.[lr]::
40637::$$$message_0352_0012_0001$$$::She was only looking at you from the start. Putting myself aside, I don't know what she would do to you."::
40638::$$$message_0352_0013_0000$$$::"W...What do you mean? I only met that girl once, so that's not possible. D-Don't scare me like that, Tohsaka."::
40639::$$$message_0352_0014_0000$$$::"...Humph. Of course we'll break off the negotiation if that happens, idiot."[lr]::
40640::$$$message_0352_0014_0001$$$::And...[lr]::
40641::$$$message_0352_0014_0002$$$::She looks away, then chugs her tea.::
40642::$$$message_0352_0015_0000$$$::"...But, we can only bet on Illyasviel for now. If Caster's identity is like Archer said, Berserker would be a natural enemy without a doubt.[lr]::
40643::$$$message_0352_0015_0001$$$::They knew each other when they were alive, so he should know Caster's tricks. Berserker can handle both Caster and Archer, even if they attack at the same time. We just have to capture Kuzuki during that time."::
40644::$$$message_0352_0016_0000$$$::"That's idealistic, but... Tohsaka, do Caster and Berserker really know each other?"::
40645::$$$message_0352_0017_0000$$$::"Yes, Archer told me that Berserker's identity is Heracles.[lr]::
40646::$$$message_0352_0017_0001$$$::If Caster is actually that extraordinary witch, then they might know each other from the Argo Expedition.[lr]::
40647::$$$message_0352_0017_0002$$$::It's just like how I don't get along with Kirei. There're always people you won't get along with in this world."::
40648::$$$message_0352_0018_0000$$$::Huh.[lr]::
40649::$$$message_0352_0018_0001$$$::But Tohsaka, I'm sure anyone would dislike that priest.::
40650::$$$message_0352_0019_0000$$$::"...Then it's decided.[lr]::
40651::$$$message_0352_0019_0001$$$::But, how should we find her? She hasn't come out since, but with that much magical energy, we should be able to find her no matter where she hides, right?[lr]::
40652::$$$message_0352_0019_0002$$$::Yet we can't find her, so doesn't that mean she's not in this town?"::
40653::$$$message_0352_0020_0000$$$:: "Probably not. Illyasviel must be having fun watching the Holy Grail War from afar."[lr]::
40654::$$$message_0352_0020_0001$$$::"...From afar...? Is she keeping watch over the town like Caster is from Ryudou Temple?"::
40655::$$$message_0352_0021_0000$$$::"I don't know. But, I have an idea of where she might be.[lr]::
40656::$$$message_0352_0021_0001$$$:: ...I heard from my dad that the Einzbern family has a villa in the forest on the outskirts of town."::
40657::$$$message_0352_0022_0000$$$::She says with a tense voice.[lr]::
40658::$$$message_0352_0022_0001$$$::   A villa that stands in the forest on the outskirts...[lr]::
40659::$$$message_0352_0022_0002$$$::I can tell how dangerous the place is just from the way Tohsaka is acting.::
