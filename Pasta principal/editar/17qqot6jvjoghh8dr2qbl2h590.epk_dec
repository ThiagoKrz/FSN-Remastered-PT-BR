58535::$$$message_0525_0000_0000$$$::The clock strikes 2:00 AM.[lr]::
58536::$$$message_0525_0000_0001$$$::A round trip to and from Ryudou Temple took its toll on me, in spite of my daily training.::
58537::$$$message_0525_0001_0000$$$::"...Oh, right. Saber, head back to your bedroom ahead of me."[lr]::
58538::$$$message_0525_0001_0001$$$::"? Where are you going, Shirou? I thought you were going to rest tonight."::
58539::$$$message_0525_0002_0000$$$::"Um, I got a thing to do. I'll be right back, so don't worry. I'm tired too, so I want to turn in early tonight."[lr]::
58540::$$$message_0525_0002_0001$$$::"I see. You must be concerned about Sakura's condition."::
58541::$$$message_0525_0003_0000$$$::"Uh. I mean, I should get her more water. Make sure you sleep in the room [font italic=true]next[font italic=false] to mine, all right? And close the door."::
58542::$$$message_0525_0004_0000$$$::"Yes, I will. It's inconvenient not to be in the same room, but if you insist, then I will do so. I will be standing by in the room next to yours."::
58543::$$$message_0525_0005_0000$$$::Saber looks displeased.[lr]::
58544::$$$message_0525_0005_0001$$$::...Hmph.[lr]::
58545::$$$message_0525_0005_0002$$$::I'm not the only one who's being stubborn.::
58546::$$$message_0525_0006_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
58547::$$$message_0525_0006_0001$$$::I return to my bedroom, tortured by self-loathing.[lr]::
58548::$$$message_0525_0006_0002$$$::"3:00 AM... What have I been doing for the past hour?"::
58549::$$$message_0525_0007_0000$$$::I sigh.[lr]::
58550::$$$message_0525_0007_0001$$$::There's only one reason I took so long.[lr]::
58551::$$$message_0525_0007_0002$$$::Sakura wasn't sleeping very well, so I spent time getting her more water and putting her covers back on.::
58552::$$$message_0525_0008_0000$$$::It was...an incredibly taxing job, in more ways than one.::
58553::$$$message_0525_0009_0000$$$::"...I should've blindfolded myself."[lr]::
58554::$$$message_0525_0009_0001$$$::That would have made it easier.[lr]::
58555::$$$message_0525_0009_0002$$$::...Actually, I had my eyes closed almost the entire time, so it wouldn't have made much difference. Not once did I give into temptation and open them until my work was done.::
58556::$$$message_0525_0010_0000$$$::"...Time for bed.[lr]::
58557::$$$message_0525_0010_0001$$$::Just go to sleep. That's all I need to do."[lr]::
58558::$$$message_0525_0010_0002$$$::I cover my head with the sheets and drive out the invasive thoughts.::
58559::$$$message_0525_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
58560::$$$message_0525_0011_0001$$$::Once I close my eyes, my mind goes blank.[lr]::
58561::$$$message_0525_0011_0002$$$::...See?[lr]::
58562::$$$message_0525_0011_0003$$$::Being this physically tired will help me fall asleep faster.::
58563::$$$message_0525_0012_0000$$$::It's red.[lr]::
58564::$$$message_0525_0012_0001$$$::At sunset, the cityscape seems dyed red.[lr]::
58565::$$$message_0525_0012_0002$$$::It reminds me of a bench covered in posters.[lr]::
58566::$$$message_0525_0012_0003$$$::Everything my feet and hands touch makes a warm, squelching sound.::
58567::$$$message_0525_0013_0000$$$::I continue down the asphalt road.[lr]::
58568::$$$message_0525_0013_0001$$$::When I look up, the buildings are dyed crimson.[lr]::
58569::$$$message_0525_0013_0002$$$::The steep walls seem like giant nails hammered from the sky to the earth.[lr]::
58570::$$$message_0525_0013_0003$$$::You can't run, the red sun declares, gazing down from the heavens.::
58571::$$$message_0525_0014_0000$$$::I walk alone through the streets.[lr]::
58572::$$$message_0525_0014_0001$$$::Shinto is dead quiet.[lr]::
58573::$$$message_0525_0014_0002$$$::Maybe everyone's hiding in wait, or perhaps there was never anyone here to begin with.::
58574::$$$message_0525_0015_0000$$$::...Still, it hurts.[lr]::
58575::$$$message_0525_0015_0001$$$::The scarlet glow torments my eyeballs and makes me dizzy.[lr]::
58576::$$$message_0525_0015_0002$$$::It's [font italic=true]too[font italic=false] empty out here.[lr]::
58577::$$$message_0525_0015_0003$$$::Am I the only one who missed some mass evacuation order?[lr]::
58578::$$$message_0525_0015_0004$$$::That would explain all the red.::
58579::$$$message_0525_0016_0000$$$::                                     I should go home.[lr]::
58580::$$$message_0525_0016_0001$$$::                                     ...is waiting for me.::
58581::$$$message_0525_0017_0000$$$::Is that...[lr]::
58582::$$$message_0525_0017_0001$$$::...Tohsaka?[lr]::
58583::$$$message_0525_0017_0002$$$::Even from afar,[lr]::
58584::$$$message_0525_0017_0003$$$::I can tell it's her.::
58585::$$$message_0525_0018_0000$$$::                                                  Heey, Tohsaka.::
58586::$$$message_0525_0019_0000$$$::She ignores me.[lr]::
58587::$$$message_0525_0019_0001$$$::She walks, her swaying hair long enough to touch the ground.[lr]::
58588::$$$message_0525_0019_0002$$$::If she's wearing her uniform, then she must be on the way to school.::
58589::$$$message_0525_0020_0000$$$::I run after her.[lr]::
58590::$$$message_0525_0020_0001$$$::Tohsaka doesn't notice me.[lr]::
58591::$$$message_0525_0020_0002$$$::The gap between us doesn't shrink at all.[lr]::
58592::$$$message_0525_0020_0003$$$::She keeps walking, while I keep running. I gradually fall even further behind.[lr]::
58593::$$$message_0525_0020_0004$$$::By the way...::
58594::$$$message_0525_0021_0000$$$::Tohsaka isn't walking at a particular brisk pace.[lr]::
58595::$$$message_0525_0021_0001$$$::I'm running enough to breath a little heavily, but she's still faster.[lr]::
58596::$$$message_0525_0021_0002$$$::The long-haired girl enters the school.[lr]::
58597::$$$message_0525_0021_0003$$$::Like a fluttering butterfly.[lr]::
58598::$$$message_0525_0021_0004$$$::By the way...::
58599::$$$message_0525_0022_0000$$$::There's no one on campus.[lr]::
58600::$$$message_0525_0022_0001$$$::It's empty. Unoccupied.[lr]::
58601::$$$message_0525_0022_0002$$$::The red-lit landscape is like a well-made candy diorama.[lr]::
58602::$$$message_0525_0022_0003$$$::If the twilight glow grows any stronger, it'll melt them beyond recognition.[lr]::
58603::$$$message_0525_0022_0004$$$::By the way...::
58604::$$$message_0525_0023_0000$$$::I hear a girl laughing.[lr]::
58605::$$$message_0525_0023_0001$$$::Two young girls smile and play with each other.[lr]::
58606::$$$message_0525_0023_0002$$$::I see a vision of two beautiful sisters, so perfect for each other they might as well be twins.[lr]::
58607::$$$message_0525_0023_0003$$$::I open the door and enter the classroom.[lr]::
58608::$$$message_0525_0023_0004$$$::   By the way...[lr]::
58609::$$$message_0525_0023_0005$$$::Why was I following her for no reason?::
58610::$$$message_0525_0024_0000$$$::It doesn't surprise me, nor do I feel any guilt.[lr]::
58611::$$$message_0525_0024_0001$$$::The two of them embrace each other like lovers. It's enough to make me doubt that they're both girls.[lr]::
58612::$$$message_0525_0024_0002$$$::Against this crimson backdrop, what they're doing seems only proper.[lr]::
58613::$$$message_0525_0024_0003$$$::But if there's one thing that I'm curious about,[lr]::
58614::$$$message_0525_0024_0004$$$::it's that Mitsuzuri's arms hang limply at her side, like those of a corpse.::
58615::$$$message_0525_0025_0000$$$::I was wrong.[lr]::
58616::$$$message_0525_0025_0001$$$::That isn't a hug.[lr]::
58617::$$$message_0525_0025_0002$$$::It's a meal.[lr]::
58618::$$$message_0525_0025_0003$$$::The praying mantis feeds on the butterfly.::
58619::$$$message_0525_0026_0000$$$::It giddily drains its prey of life.[lr]::
58620::$$$message_0525_0026_0001$$$::Mitsuzuri is like a wax model. With each second, her vitality is drained away.[lr]::
58621::$$$message_0525_0026_0002$$$::Tohsaka's eyes are warm and whimsical.[lr]::
58622::$$$message_0525_0026_0003$$$::Her face approaches Mitsuzuri's neck.[lr]::
58623::$$$message_0525_0026_0004$$$::She exposes Mitsuzuri's defenseless, pale throat.[lr]::
58624::$$$message_0525_0026_0005$$$::Then, Tohsaka's lips[line2]no, her teeth...::
58625::$$$message_0525_0027_0000$$$::The wax model's chest arches in tension.[lr]::
58626::$$$message_0525_0027_0001$$$::I try to go over and help her, but I may as well be wading through a swamp.[lr]::
58627::$$$message_0525_0027_0002$$$::I'll never make it in time.[lr]::
58628::$$$message_0525_0027_0003$$$::I simply watch as Tohsaka purrs while she drinks, as Mitsuzuri goes weak at the knees.::
58629::$$$message_0525_0028_0000$$$::"Hm...mmm..."[lr]::
58630::$$$message_0525_0028_0001$$$::She licks her fingers.[lr]::
58631::$$$message_0525_0028_0002$$$::Her wet tongue seductively slithers around her fingers.[lr]::
58632::$$$message_0525_0028_0003$$$::It's too alluring.[lr]::
58633::$$$message_0525_0028_0004$$$::I feel like I'm drowning in the thick air around her.::
58634::$$$message_0525_0029_0000$$$::"Heh heh heh...mmm..."[lr]::
58635::$$$message_0525_0029_0001$$$::Tohsaka giggles, licking her fingers.[lr]::
58636::$$$message_0525_0029_0002$$$::The wet sound tickles my ears.::
58637::$$$message_0525_0030_0000$$$::"I'm glad you came, Emiya."[lr]::
58638::$$$message_0525_0030_0001$$$::Her voice sounds so sticky and expectant.[lr]::
58639::$$$message_0525_0030_0002$$$::I'm so dizzy, it's like I'm inside a kaleidoscope.[lr]::
58640::$$$message_0525_0030_0003$$$::My mind is paralyzed, to say nothing of my limbs.[lr]::
58641::$$$message_0525_0030_0004$$$::Though, I should mention...[lr]::
58642::$$$message_0525_0030_0005$$$::I've long since lost control over my body.::
58643::$$$message_0525_0031_0000$$$::"What's wrong...? Are you afraid of me, Emiya?"[lr]::
58644::$$$message_0525_0031_0001$$$::I can't even move my head to respond.[lr]::
58645::$$$message_0525_0031_0002$$$::Her smile is irresitably bewitching, yet so terrifying, I feel like I'll be caught and killed.[lr]::
58646::$$$message_0525_0031_0003$$$::I'm a winged insect caught in a spider's web.[lr]::
58647::$$$message_0525_0031_0004$$$::I can neither fight nor flee.::
58648::$$$message_0525_0032_0000$$$::"Ayako was delicious."[lr]::
58649::$$$message_0525_0032_0001$$$::So she was eating after all.[lr]::
58650::$$$message_0525_0032_0002$$$::But still...why Mitsuzuri?::
58651::$$$message_0525_0033_0000$$$::"I just couldn't take the hunger while I was waiting for you."[lr]::
58652::$$$message_0525_0033_0001$$$::Delight seeps into her giggles.[lr]::
58653::$$$message_0525_0033_0002$$$::Tohsaka's hands reach out.[lr]::
58654::$$$message_0525_0033_0003$$$::For some reason, I imagine her slender, supple arms, coiling around my body like a snake.[lr]::
58655::$$$message_0525_0033_0004$$$::Her sweet scent envelops me and dominates my lungs.::
58656::$$$message_0525_0034_0000$$$::"Hehe... You're next."[lr]::
58657::$$$message_0525_0034_0001$$$::Tohsaka's limbs wrap around me.[lr]::
58658::$$$message_0525_0034_0002$$$::Her soft, feminine body drowns out the blaring alarm in my head.::
58659::$$$message_0525_0035_0000$$$::I feel like I'm crumbling in her embrace.[lr]::
58660::$$$message_0525_0035_0001$$$::She brings her face close enough for our lips to touch. Her wet eyes invite me in.[lr]::
58661::$$$message_0525_0035_0002$$$::Her breath is so thick, I'm going to suffocate in it.::
58662::$$$message_0525_0036_0000$$$::"Mm... Now I'm going to eat you, Emiya."[lr]::
58663::$$$message_0525_0036_0001$$$::Tohsaka's lips touch me,[lr]::
58664::$$$message_0525_0036_0002$$$::nipping the side of my neck.[lr]::
58665::$$$message_0525_0036_0003$$$::They're warm...and damp.[lr]::
58666::$$$message_0525_0036_0004$$$::My mind melts like candy under their tender touch.::
58667::$$$message_0525_0037_0000$$$::"Mmm..."[lr]::
58668::$$$message_0525_0037_0001$$$::Sharp fangs pierce my skin.[lr]::
58669::$$$message_0525_0037_0002$$$::Tohsaka's biting me.[lr]::
58670::$$$message_0525_0037_0003$$$::Her teeth sink into my neck, just like with Mitsuzuri...::
58671::$$$message_0525_0038_0000$$$::There's no pain.[lr]::
58672::$$$message_0525_0038_0001$$$::I've heard that spiders anesthetize their prey before killing them.[lr]::
58673::$$$message_0525_0038_0002$$$::With the numbness also comes ecstasy. Her sucking lips and teeth feel so good it's like I'm melting.::
58674::$$$message_0525_0039_0000$$$::...My neck softly melts.[lr]::
58675::$$$message_0525_0039_0001$$$::Each time Tohsaka drains a mouthful out of me, I feel my body turn to candy.[lr]::
58676::$$$message_0525_0039_0002$$$::My insides are being sucked out and replaced with honey that makes my body melt.[lr]::
58677::$$$message_0525_0039_0003$$$::It seeps into my bones, muscles,[stopnoise] and skin.::
58678::$$$message_0525_0040_0000$$$::It floods my throat, and I can't even moan.[lr]::
58679::$$$message_0525_0040_0001$$$::It flows down from my neck,[stopnoise] the unbelievable sensation beguiling me.[lr]::
58680::$$$message_0525_0040_0002$$$::Tohsaka's shoulders tremble in ecstasy as she drinks from my neck.[lr]::
58681::$$$message_0525_0040_0003$$$::She looks so pleased by the meal of red blood...::
58682::$$$message_0525_0041_0000$$$::My consciousness is coated in a messy, overlapping carpet of vertigo.[lr]::
58683::$$$message_0525_0041_0001$$$::Before I know it, I've stopped breathing, and my blood is being drained before it can even reach my brain.[lr]::
58684::$$$message_0525_0041_0002$$$::In return, Tohsaka's sweet, strong liquid invades my body.::
58685::$$$message_0525_0042_0000$$$::"Ah...mm. Delicious..."[lr]::
58686::$$$message_0525_0042_0001$$$::While she nibbles at me,[noise monocro=1 type=ltDodge opacity=220] I hear a voice that doesn't belong.[stopnoise][lr]::
58687::$$$message_0525_0042_0002$$$::The voice numbs my melting brain.::
58688::$$$message_0525_0043_0000$$$::"Haah...mm... You're so hot...Emiya..."[lr]::
58689::$$$message_0525_0043_0001$$$::She whispers, drinking me dry.[lr]::
58690::$$$message_0525_0043_0002$$$::A pump empties me out from the inside.[lr]::
58691::$$$message_0525_0043_0003$$$::In return, pleasure saturates my body, melting[stopnoise] and turning it limp.::
58692::$$$message_0525_0044_0000$$$::"Your fresh, youthful blood is so tasty and full of life..."[lr]::
58693::$$$message_0525_0044_0001$$$::I'm at my limit.[lr]::
58694::$$$message_0525_0044_0002$$$::I have nothing else to give.[lr]::
58695::$$$message_0525_0044_0003$$$::My arteries are bone dry. I don't think I have even a drop of blood left to spare.::
58696::$$$message_0525_0045_0000$$$::"More...[noise monocro=1 type=ltDodge opacity=230] It's still...not enough..."::
58697::$$$message_0525_0046_0000$$$::She continues drinking.[lr]::
58698::$$$message_0525_0046_0001$$$::There shouldn't be anything left to drink, but I still hear Tohsaka gulping.[lr]::
58699::$$$message_0525_0046_0002$$$::It's as if my life itself is being converted into blood.[lr]::
58700::$$$message_0525_0046_0003$$$::That makes sense. Then, this meal isn't quite over yet.::
58701::$$$message_0525_0047_0000$$$::She keeps drinking and drinking.[lr]::
58702::$$$message_0525_0047_0001$$$::In the crimson-lit classroom, she drains me without end.[lr]::
58703::$$$message_0525_0047_0002$$$::My body melts beyond recognition, fading to oblivion as she sucks it all up.::
58704::$$$message_0525_0048_0000$$$::"Mm... You're wonderful, Emiya. I'll take all of you."::
58705::$$$message_0525_0049_0000$$$::A woman's voice reverberates in my mind.[lr]::
58706::$$$message_0525_0049_0001$$$::I wither away, dessicated, while she whispers.::
