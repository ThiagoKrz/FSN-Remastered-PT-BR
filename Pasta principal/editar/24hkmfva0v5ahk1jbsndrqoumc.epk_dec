7086::$$$message_0066_0000_0000$$$::"...Please come."::
7087::$$$message_0066_0001_0000$$$::I murmur those words like a prayer.[lr]::
7088::$$$message_0066_0001_0001$$$::My life doesn't matter anymore.[lr]::
7089::$$$message_0066_0001_0002$$$::But to put a stop to this savage brutality...[lr]::
7090::$$$message_0066_0001_0003$$$::"No...COME...SABER!!!"[lr]::
7091::$$$message_0066_0001_0004$$$::I muster up all my strength and call for my blade.[lr]::
7092::$$$message_0066_0001_0005$$$::One of my Command Spell strokes disappears.[lr]::
7093::$$$message_0066_0001_0006$$$::At that very moment, the space around me begins to waver.::
7094::$$$message_0066_0002_0000$$$::So [font italic=true]this[font italic=false] is magic.[lr]::
7095::$$$message_0066_0002_0001$$$::Saber, clad in her silver armor, bursts through the ripples in space and time to appear before me.::
7096::$$$message_0066_0003_0000$$$::"Gah...ha...!"[lr]::
7097::$$$message_0066_0003_0001$$$::My back slams into the ground.::
7098::$$$message_0066_0004_0000$$$::"Ah...ha...aaahhhh...!"[lr]::
7099::$$$message_0066_0004_0001$$$::I stop breathing.[lr]::
7100::$$$message_0066_0004_0002$$$::The force of impact jars every bone and organ in my body.[lr]::
7101::$$$message_0066_0004_0003$$$::Several ribs crack, or probably break outright.::
7102::$$$message_0066_0005_0000$$$::"Ah...hh...ggh!"[lr]::
7103::$$$message_0066_0005_0001$$$::And yet...[lr]::
7104::$$$message_0066_0005_0002$$$::...my body is intact. My bloody arms are still attached.::
7105::$$$message_0066_0006_0000$$$::"Shirou!"[lr]::
7106::$$$message_0066_0006_0001$$$::Saber runs to me.[lr]::
7107::$$$message_0066_0006_0002$$$::Forcing my numb limbs to move, I push to my feet to show her that I'm all right.::
7108::$$$message_0066_0007_0000$$$::"There's no time to explain. You understand what's happening, right, Saber?"[lr]::
7109::$$$message_0066_0007_0001$$$::"Please wait, Shirou. I do understand, but first, your body must[line2]"[lr]::
7110::$$$message_0066_0007_0002$$$::"Take care of Rider. Only you can beat her."::
7111::$$$message_0066_0008_0000$$$::"I cannot. Treating you is my first priority. You will not survive these wounds."[lr]::
7112::$$$message_0066_0008_0001$$$::"No. There's something else that needs doing first."[lr]::
7113::$$$message_0066_0008_0002$$$::We need to beat Shinji and Rider. As quickly as possible.[lr]::
7114::$$$message_0066_0008_0003$$$::Nothing is more important.::
7115::$$$message_0066_0009_0000$$$::"But if I do that..."[lr]::
7116::$$$message_0066_0009_0001$$$::Saber is focused only on me.[lr]::
7117::$$$message_0066_0009_0002$$$::I'd be lying if I said I wasn't happy about that.[lr]::
7118::$$$message_0066_0009_0003$$$::But there's no time to argue.[lr]::
7119::$$$message_0066_0009_0004$$$::If Saber doesn't want to listen, I just need to use my second Command Spell.::
7120::$$$message_0066_0010_0000$$$::"...Hn."[lr]::
7121::$$$message_0066_0010_0001$$$::She must have understood my resolve.[lr]::
7122::$$$message_0066_0010_0002$$$::Saber reluctantly accepts my decision.::
7123::$$$message_0066_0011_0000$$$::"Understood. Master, your orders."[lr]::
7124::$$$message_0066_0011_0001$$$::"Defeat Rider. I'll handle Shinji."[lr]::
7125::$$$message_0066_0011_0002$$$::Saber does not hesitate.[lr]::
7126::$$$message_0066_0011_0003$$$::She nods and, without another word, turns toward the school building like a whirlwind.[lr]::
