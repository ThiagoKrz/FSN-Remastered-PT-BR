59290::$$$message_0537_0000_0000$$$::It's clear that the longer I wait, the greater my disadvantage will become.[lr]::
59291::$$$message_0537_0000_0001$$$::That means I should escape these dire straits while I can still move.[lr]::
59292::$$$message_0537_0000_0002$$$::I'll charge in and cut the old mage down before the bugs surrounding me on all sides can crawl up my body!::
59293::$$$message_0537_0001_0000$$$::It doesn't feel like I got him.[lr]::
59294::$$$message_0537_0001_0001$$$::My diagonal slash slices easily through him like a tomato, and the pieces fall to the floor.::
59295::$$$message_0537_0002_0000$$$::"Oh! I see, I see. You're very decisive, boy!"[lr]::
59296::$$$message_0537_0002_0001$$$::The fallen pieces of the old mage laugh at me.::
59297::$$$message_0537_0003_0000$$$::"Argh...!"[lr]::
59298::$$$message_0537_0003_0001$$$::The kyousaku stick rots and crumbles in my hands.[lr]::
59299::$$$message_0537_0003_0002$$$::   He got me.[lr]::
59300::$$$message_0537_0003_0003$$$::That old devil gave up his body to destroy my Strengthened stick...!::
59301::$$$message_0537_0004_0000$$$::"You're cornered. In your passion, you lost your only weapon. The young ones are always so impatient."[lr]::
59302::$$$message_0537_0004_0001$$$::"...!"::
59303::$$$message_0537_0005_0000$$$::I run.[lr]::
59304::$$$message_0537_0005_0001$$$::Bugs squish and crunch under my feet as I move.[lr]::
59305::$$$message_0537_0005_0002$$$::I feel death closing in from behind,[lr]::
59306::$$$message_0537_0005_0003$$$::and in a desperate bid to avoid the buzzing wave of insects,[lr]::
59307::$$$message_0537_0005_0004$$$::I throw my shoulder against one of the dark walls leading outside...!::
59308::$$$message_0537_0006_0000$$$::"I got out...!"[lr]::
59309::$$$message_0537_0006_0001$$$::I roll out of the room, preserving my momentum.::
59310::$$$message_0537_0007_0000$$$::"Hah...!"[lr]::
59311::$$$message_0537_0007_0001$$$::The bugs don't follow me.[lr]::
59312::$$$message_0537_0007_0002$$$::In my dazed sprint to escape the shrine, I ended up on the opposite side of the temple yard.::
59313::$$$message_0537_0008_0000$$$::"Ow..."[lr]::
59314::$$$message_0537_0008_0001$$$::I feel pain throughout my body. Maybe I hit something when I fell out of the building.[lr]::
59315::$$$message_0537_0008_0002$$$::"But so what? More importantly, right now..."::
59316::$$$message_0537_0009_0000$$$::I need to find Saber as soon as possible.[lr]::
59317::$$$message_0537_0009_0001$$$::A feeling of dread hangs over me.[lr]::
59318::$$$message_0537_0009_0002$$$::The anxiety gets worse and worse. I need to see Saber's face soon, or...::
59319::$$$message_0537_0010_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
59320::$$$message_0537_0010_0001$$$::The water ripples.[lr]::
59321::$$$message_0537_0010_0002$$$::Sensing danger, I leap away from it.::
59322::$$$message_0537_0011_0000$$$::The moist ground lets go of my feet.[lr]::
59323::$$$message_0537_0011_0001$$$::"Ngh...!?"[lr]::
59324::$$$message_0537_0011_0002$$$::But I only manage to jump back briefly.::
59325::$$$message_0537_0012_0000$$$::   Dull pain.[lr]::
59326::$$$message_0537_0012_0001$$$::Something feels wrong with my heels, and I look down.::
59327::$$$message_0537_0013_0000$$$::"Wha..."[lr]::
59328::$$$message_0537_0013_0001$$$::They're all red.[lr]::
59329::$$$message_0537_0013_0002$$$::When I jumped, both of my feet fell off, like discarded shoes...::
59330::$$$message_0537_0014_0000$$$::"Those things back there..."[lr]::
59331::$$$message_0537_0014_0001$$$::When I escaped the shrine room, I trampled on countless bugs.[lr]::
59332::$$$message_0537_0014_0002$$$::I recall how my Strengthened stick rotted away when I used it to cut Zouken's body.[lr]::
59333::$$$message_0537_0014_0003$$$::It stands to reason that my feet, which stepped on those same bugs, would meet the same fate.::
59334::$$$message_0537_0015_0000$$$::"Ergh, guh...!"[lr]::
59335::$$$message_0537_0015_0001$$$::On my hands and knees, I try to escape the bog on the remaining stumps of my feet.::
59336::$$$message_0537_0016_0000$$$::"Haha. So close, boy. Your decision wasn't wrong, but you lacked the power to back it up."[lr]::
59337::$$$message_0537_0016_0001$$$::The insect-user's voice resonates.[lr]::
59338::$$$message_0537_0016_0002$$$::[line3]The ground is muddy.[lr]::
59339::$$$message_0537_0016_0003$$$::Spiders have always lived in wet places.::
59340::$$$message_0537_0017_0000$$$::"Now, I have Saber.[lr]::
59341::$$$message_0537_0017_0001$$$::Such a pity. You've lost the only reason for me to keep you alive."::
59342::$$$message_0537_0018_0000$$$::More insects I've never seen flutter down.[lr]::
59343::$$$message_0537_0018_0001$$$::They nibble my flesh, burrow into my muscles, and inject me with venom hundreds of times, dissolving my bones.[lr]::
59344::$$$message_0537_0018_0002$$$::   I'm forced to endure chilling pain worse than hell itself, until my consciousness finally expires.::
