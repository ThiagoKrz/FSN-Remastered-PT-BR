78179::$$$message_0726_0000_0000$$$::It's the middle of the night, but the church is brightly lit.[lr]::
78180::$$$message_0726_0000_0001$$$::Saber hands the unconscious victim over to me in front of the church, and I take her inside.[lr]::
78181::$$$message_0726_0000_0002$$$::I call loudly for Kotomine, who comes out, takes one look at the victim, and carries her into a back room.[lr]::
78182::$$$message_0726_0000_0003$$$::Apparently, the only room that's usable as a treatment room is Kotomine's own chambers.::
78183::$$$message_0726_0001_0000$$$::"Haah..."[lr]::
78184::$$$message_0726_0001_0001$$$::I sit on one of the pews.[lr]::
78185::$$$message_0726_0001_0002$$$::...For now, I've done everything I can.[lr]::
78186::$$$message_0726_0001_0003$$$::It's up to Kotomine whether she'll pull through.[lr]::
78187::$$$message_0726_0001_0004$$$::I just have to trust him and wait for the outcome.::
78188::$$$message_0726_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
78189::$$$message_0726_0002_0001$$$::...Time passes.[lr]::
78190::$$$message_0726_0002_0002$$$::I know Saber's waiting for me outside, but I can't leave just yet.::
78191::$$$message_0726_0003_0000$$$::Besides, I want some time to think alone.[lr]::
78192::$$$message_0726_0003_0001$$$::The Matou family turned out to be a bloodline of mages.[lr]::
78193::$$$message_0726_0003_0002$$$::Shinji became a Master with a Servant under his command.[lr]::
78194::$$$message_0726_0003_0003$$$::Zouken Matou let the family heir fight in the Holy Grail War, even though they've lost their power.::
78195::$$$message_0726_0004_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
78196::$$$message_0726_0004_0001$$$::The Einzberns aren't the only faction with a fixation on the Holy Grail.[lr]::
78197::$$$message_0726_0004_0002$$$::Makiri and Tohsaka.[lr]::
78198::$$$message_0726_0004_0003$$$::In fact, people close to the grail itself are bound to become Masters.::
78199::$$$message_0726_0005_0000$$$::...Even Saber is no exception.[lr]::
78200::$$$message_0726_0005_0001$$$::The Einzberns sought the grail for a thousand years.[lr]::
78201::$$$message_0726_0005_0002$$$::I can't even begin to imagine that level of obsession.[lr]::
78202::$$$message_0726_0005_0003$$$::There are things that require the Holy Grail's power to be saved or healed.::
78203::$$$message_0726_0006_0000$$$::My old man defied the grail and chose to destroy it instead.[lr]::
78204::$$$message_0726_0006_0001$$$::Can I see this through to the end with the same conviction?[lr]::
78205::$$$message_0726_0006_0002$$$::Do I really have the right to fight in the same war as the Einzberns and Makiris,[lr]::
78206::$$$message_0726_0006_0003$$$::who have been chasing their goal for hundreds of years...?::
78207::$$$message_0726_0007_0000$$$::"I must say, I didn't expect you to bring me an injured person the very same day I offered to help you."[lr]::
78208::$$$message_0726_0007_0001$$$::"Kotomine."[lr]::
78209::$$$message_0726_0007_0002$$$::I look up.[lr]::
78210::$$$message_0726_0007_0003$$$::Kotomine's expression isn't grim.[lr]::
78211::$$$message_0726_0007_0004$$$::That must mean the treatment went well.::
78212::$$$message_0726_0008_0000$$$::"Kotomine, what happened to the woman?"[lr]::
78213::$$$message_0726_0008_0001$$$::"I've done what I can. The rest depends on her. If you'd brought her even a half hour later, I would have had to perform the rites of my actual occupation."::
78214::$$$message_0726_0009_0000$$$::"...I see. Sorry, and thanks.[lr]::
78215::$$$message_0726_0009_0001$$$::I'm...glad you were awake."[lr]::
78216::$$$message_0726_0009_0002$$$::"What's wrong? Does it pain you so much to express gratitude to me? If anything troubles you, I'll listen."::
78217::$$$message_0726_0010_0000$$$::"...I dunno. I've got plenty on my plate right now, and you're the one who keeps adding to it. I'm sick of hearing your long sermons."::
78218::$$$message_0726_0011_0000$$$::"Our discussion today bothered you? ...Hm. I meant to motivate you, but it seems to have only confused you further. That's quite regrettable."[lr]::
78219::$$$message_0726_0011_0001$$$::The priest seems rueful, but I can't tell how sincere he is.::
78220::$$$message_0726_0012_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
78221::$$$message_0726_0012_0001$$$::But I'm not going to let this awkward silence win.[lr]::
78222::$$$message_0726_0012_0002$$$::"So, um...[lr]::
78223::$$$message_0726_0012_0003$$$::Someone I know is a Master."[lr]::
78224::$$$message_0726_0012_0004$$$::I murmur pitifully, unable to keep it to myself.::
78225::$$$message_0726_0013_0000$$$::The priest says nothing.[lr]::
78226::$$$message_0726_0013_0001$$$::He merely nods in acknowledgement.::
78227::$$$message_0726_0014_0000$$$::"And you defeated him, of course."[lr]::
78228::$$$message_0726_0014_0001$$$::I answer the short question with a nod of my own.::
78229::$$$message_0726_0015_0000$$$::"Then there is no need to be sorry. People cannot change their pasts.[lr]::
78230::$$$message_0726_0015_0001$$$::All we can do is affirm our own actions.[lr]::
78231::$$$message_0726_0015_0002$$$::If you must shoulder your sins, then question your next actions. Only you can decide how to face the tragedies of the past."::
78232::$$$message_0726_0016_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
78233::$$$message_0726_0016_0001$$$::The priest is right, again.[lr]::
78234::$$$message_0726_0016_0002$$$::The problem isn't that Shinji was a Master, or that the Matou and Tohsaka families are mages, or that the Einzberns are obsessed with the Holy Grail.[lr]::
78235::$$$message_0726_0016_0003$$$::What matters are the choices I make next.::
78236::$$$message_0726_0017_0000$$$::"I'm going home. Take care of her."[lr]::
78237::$$$message_0726_0017_0001$$$::I stand up and make to leave the chapel.[lr]::
78238::$$$message_0726_0017_0002$$$::Saber's waiting for me outside.[lr]::
78239::$$$message_0726_0017_0003$$$::Now that I know the woman will be all right, I have no reason to stay here.::
78240::$$$message_0726_0018_0000$$$::"A moment, Shirou Emiya. Allow me to offer a word of advice."[lr]::
78241::$$$message_0726_0018_0001$$$::"...What now? I already said no more lectures."[lr]::
78242::$$$message_0726_0018_0002$$$::"It won't take long. I've already gone through the trouble of healing your charge in the middle of the night, so consider this your fee and listen."[lr]::
78243::$$$message_0726_0018_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
78244::$$$message_0726_0018_0004$$$::Can't argue with that.[lr]::
78245::$$$message_0726_0018_0005$$$::I reluctantly turn back and stand in front of the priest.::
78246::$$$message_0726_0019_0000$$$::"I neglected to mention something today.[lr]::
78247::$$$message_0726_0019_0001$$$::The Einzberns have survived for the last millennium in pursuit of their wish. It's quite a monumental feat, and you were only right to feel daunted by it."[lr]::
78248::$$$message_0726_0019_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
78249::$$$message_0726_0019_0003$$$::...This is why I can't deal with this guy.[lr]::
78250::$$$message_0726_0019_0004$$$::I haven't even said anything yet, but he hits me right where I'm most uncertain.::
78251::$$$message_0726_0020_0000$$$::"...You're so annoying. Are you still going on about that?"::
78252::$$$message_0726_0021_0000$$$::"That's not my point. I'm merely saying that you needn't overly concern yourself with it.[lr]::
78253::$$$message_0726_0021_0001$$$::It isn't anything extraordinary. It's quite a common circumstance in this war, actually.[lr]::
78254::$$$message_0726_0021_0002$$$::The Holy Grail War is a crystallization of man's feats and blessings. One need not feel guilt in joining the war, nor killing over it."::
78255::$$$message_0726_0022_0000$$$::"All humans have their respective wishes and compete to fulfill them. That is what life is all about. Whether great or small, we all share in this underlying principle.[lr]::
78256::$$$message_0726_0022_0001$$$::I doubt you will ever find an exception to this rule.[lr]::
78257::$$$message_0726_0022_0002$$$::Of course, success and failure are a different matter. While we all live in pursuit of our objectives, we all meet our ends without ever reaching our goals."::
78258::$$$message_0726_0023_0000$$$::"All things have an order to them. A wish can only be fulfilled through sufficient effort and resources. We call that accumulated vain effort 'life.'[lr]::
78259::$$$message_0726_0023_0001$$$::The Holy Grail simply abridges that necessary effort.[lr]::
78260::$$$message_0726_0023_0002$$$::And the Holy Grail War is a mortal battle to simplify the human way of life."::
78261::$$$message_0726_0024_0000$$$::"In other words, it is nothing special.[lr]::
78262::$$$message_0726_0024_0001$$$::The seven Masters are simply attempting to take the shortest path to achieve something that otherwise would have taken their entire lives to do.[lr]::
78263::$$$message_0726_0024_0002$$$::But there's nothing else particularly extraordinary about it. It's utterly human for people to crush others' wishes to make their own come true.[lr]::
78264::$$$message_0726_0024_0003$$$::The Holy Grail War is no different from life itself.[lr]::
78265::$$$message_0726_0024_0004$$$::You should simply do as you desire and win, without troubling yourself over it."::
78266::$$$message_0726_0025_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
78267::$$$message_0726_0025_0001$$$::The priest's tone is pleasant.[lr]::
78268::$$$message_0726_0025_0002$$$::To him, there's no difference between noble and mundane wishes.[lr]::
78269::$$$message_0726_0025_0003$$$::He doesn't judge the quality of anyone's desire.[lr]::
78270::$$$message_0726_0025_0004$$$::He's saying I should follow my heart and trample on everyone else's wishes...[lr]::
78271::$$$message_0726_0025_0005$$$::I can't tell if he's being sarcastic or not.[lr]::
78272::$$$message_0726_0025_0006$$$::But what I hear loud and clear is his serious declaration that even a half-baked Master like me can find meaning in this war.::
78273::$$$message_0726_0026_0000$$$::"...Hell must have frozen over, if you're worrying about me."[lr]::
78274::$$$message_0726_0026_0001$$$::"Oh, I simply told you not to worry. After all, I'd be a failure of a priest if I added to my flock's troubles, instead of lifting them away."[lr]::
78275::$$$message_0726_0026_0002$$$::...What a piece of work.[lr]::
78276::$$$message_0726_0026_0003$$$::If Tohsaka heard that, she'd say he's always been a failure.::
78277::$$$message_0726_0027_0000$$$::"I never asked for that. See you around, fake priest."[lr]::
78278::$$$message_0726_0027_0001$$$::"Yes. Do fail to learn your lesson and come again."[lr]::
78279::$$$message_0726_0027_0002$$$::I snort, turn on my heel, and march out of the church.[lr]::
78280::$$$message_0726_0027_0003$$$::This time, I really do leave, announcing it with loud and forceful footsteps.::
78281::$$$message_0726_0028_0000$$$::Saber's waiting for me outside the church.[lr]::
78282::$$$message_0726_0028_0001$$$::...Come to think of it, my daytime visit went exactly like this, too.[lr]::
78283::$$$message_0726_0028_0002$$$::Saber patiently waited for me in the frigid winter night.::
78284::$$$message_0726_0029_0000$$$::That might be how a Master-Servant dynamic is meant to be anyway, but she's still here for my sake.[lr]::
78285::$$$message_0726_0029_0001$$$::I hope I can repay her goodwill.::
78286::$$$message_0726_0030_0000$$$::"She's going to be all right. It's all thanks to you, Saber."[lr]::
78287::$$$message_0726_0030_0001$$$::"I require no thanks. You're the one who saved that woman, Shirou. I merely accepted your decision."[lr]::
78288::$$$message_0726_0030_0002$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
78289::$$$message_0726_0030_0003$$$::She gives me a surprisingly kind expression.::
78290::$$$message_0726_0031_0000$$$::"Ah, um...that's not true. You saved her. I never would have made it in time, plus..."::
78291::$$$message_0726_0032_0000$$$::She let Zouken Matou get away, just to help a victim.[lr]::
78292::$$$message_0726_0032_0001$$$::If we'd stopped the old man from leaving, there would have been another fight. The woman was in critical condition, and wouldn't have made it.[lr]::
78293::$$$message_0726_0032_0002$$$::Saber must have had that in mind when she let Zouken go.::
78294::$$$message_0726_0033_0000$$$::"W-what is it, Shirou? You're smiling for no reason."[lr]::
78295::$$$message_0726_0033_0001$$$::"Huh? Oh, there's a good reason. I'm glad you lived up to first impressions. Thank you, Saber. I'm happy that you went along with my stupid orders."::
78296::$$$message_0726_0034_0000$$$::"S-speak nothing of it! I would never defy your[line2]"::
78297::$$$message_0726_0035_0000$$$::"Oh really, now? I seem to recall you calling me na√Øve and soft, saying that I don't know what war is like.[lr]::
78298::$$$message_0726_0035_0001$$$::Saber, your face said that you'd do your best to cooperate but would change the plan if the situation called for it."::
78299::$$$message_0726_0036_0000$$$::"N-no I wasn't! I simply said that I would prioritize my own decisions if you were in danger! Don't give me that tone, Shirou!"[lr]::
78300::$$$message_0726_0036_0001$$$::Saber grunts in indignance.::
78301::$$$message_0726_0037_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
78302::$$$message_0726_0037_0001$$$::Her pouty face looks so similar yet different from the way she's been acting that I can't help but smile.::
78303::$$$message_0726_0038_0000$$$::"Shirou. It appears that you need a lesson in manners."[lr]::
78304::$$$message_0726_0038_0001$$$::"Then you'd better teach me once you get a chance. But more importantly, we should end this war."::
78305::$$$message_0726_0039_0000$$$::"Shirou?"[lr]::
78306::$$$message_0726_0039_0001$$$::"Unlike you, I don't need the Holy Grail.[lr]::
78307::$$$message_0726_0039_0002$$$::I was thinking that we'd end the war and give the Grail to you if we survive. I wasn't confident that my half-hearted conviction made me good enough to be your partner, Saber."::
78308::$$$message_0726_0040_0000$$$::"I see. And now? You engaged in battle of your own accord. Have you had a change of heart?"::
78309::$$$message_0726_0041_0000$$$::"Not at all. I still don't accept this Holy Grail War.[lr]::
78310::$$$message_0726_0041_0001$$$::...But, I'll fight until the end.[lr]::
78311::$$$message_0726_0041_0002$$$::I don't have a wish for the Holy Grail, unlike the others.[lr]::
78312::$$$message_0726_0041_0003$$$::But my objective has always been to protect other people. To do what's right.[lr]::
78313::$$$message_0726_0041_0004$$$::That doesn't mean I think any less of the others. They all have their own reasons for fighting. Some have been after the Grail for five hundred years or even a thousand."::
78314::$$$message_0726_0042_0000$$$::"I see. Yes, that does make sense."::
78315::$$$message_0726_0043_0000$$$::"Then allow me to swear an oath to you.[lr]::
78316::$$$message_0726_0043_0001$$$::As long you are worthy of my service, I swear to be your sword. Remain true to yourself, Shirou...and I will never betray you."[lr]::
78317::$$$message_0726_0043_0002$$$::"Ah...Yeah. I'll do my best, Saber."::
78318::$$$message_0726_0044_0000$$$::Her honest smile makes me feel a little awkward, so I look up at the sky.[lr]::
78319::$$$message_0726_0044_0001$$$::The starry winter sky reminds me of a frozen lake. It's so beautiful.::
78320::$$$message_0726_0045_0000$$$::                                         [font italic=true]I will never betray you.[font italic=false]::
78321::$$$message_0726_0046_0000$$$::I gaze up at the night sky, so far removed from the surface and from tonight's events.[lr]::
78322::$$$message_0726_0046_0001$$$::Under that same sky, she made a promise to me as if it were the most natural thing in the world.[lr]::
78323::$$$message_0726_0046_0002$$$::I need to do everything I can to live up to that trust.[lr]::
78324::$$$message_0726_0046_0003$$$::To stay true to the person that she thinks I am.[lr]::
78325::$$$message_0726_0046_0004$$$::At the very least, I hope I can look back on this path one day without any regrets.°7
