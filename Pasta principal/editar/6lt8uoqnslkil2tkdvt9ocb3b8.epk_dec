21989::$$$message_0198_0000_0000$$$::"Ha...ah!"[lr]::
21990::$$$message_0198_0000_0001$$$::I pour all the strength I have left into my one good arm.[lr]::
21991::$$$message_0198_0000_0002$$$::I try to grip the ground with my sticky, slippery arm and lever myself upright, even as I'm on the verge of literally splitting apart.::
21992::$$$message_0198_0001_0000$$$::"Hnnngh!"[lr]::
21993::$$$message_0198_0001_0001$$$::For a brief second I see Saber's face.[lr]::
21994::$$$message_0198_0001_0002$$$::She's on the brink of tears.[lr]::
21995::$$$message_0198_0001_0003$$$::In that moment, I'm proud to know falling in love with her wasn't a mistake.::
21996::$$$message_0198_0002_0000$$$::"Hold it. It's not over yet."[lr]::
21997::$$$message_0198_0002_0001$$$::I force myself up.[lr]::
21998::$$$message_0198_0002_0002$$$::Neither of my legs work.[lr]::
21999::$$$message_0198_0002_0003$$$::The magical energy that barely kept my body moving is gone.[lr]::
22000::$$$message_0198_0002_0004$$$::All that remains is my faint heartbeat and the throbbing of my organs trying desperately to continue functioning.::
22001::$$$message_0198_0003_0000$$$::"Ah. Feeling regret, are we? I can hardly blame you. But that treasure is beyond you. I can hardly blame you for wanting to take it for yourself. That must make it all the more painful to see it in the hands of another man."[lr]::
22002::$$$message_0198_0003_0001$$$::Too far. He goes too far.[lr]::
22003::$$$message_0198_0003_0002$$$::I can't listen to another [font italic=true]second[font italic=false] of his shit.::
22004::$$$message_0198_0004_0000$$$::"Enough...quit talking about Saber like she's...just some [font italic=true]thing[font italic=false] to be claimed..."[lr]::
22005::$$$message_0198_0004_0001$$$::I pour what energy I can into my right arm.[lr]::
22006::$$$message_0198_0004_0002$$$::It feels like it's made of lead.[lr]::
22007::$$$message_0198_0004_0003$$$::My body creaks and protests, but begins to obey.::
22008::$$$message_0198_0005_0000$$$::"Ha...aaa...ghhh!"[lr]::
22009::$$$message_0198_0005_0001$$$::I push myself up to one knee.::
22010::$$$message_0198_0006_0000$$$::"Knhhh...damn...listen to...me!"[lr]::
22011::$$$message_0198_0006_0001$$$::I take a deep breath, trying to focus what strength I have left.[lr]::
22012::$$$message_0198_0006_0002$$$::Every time I move, I feel my organs shifting around as if with minds of their own.::
22013::$$$message_0198_0007_0000$$$::"Why...why do you not understand that it is pointless!?"::
22014::$$$message_0198_0008_0000$$$::Saber sounds like she's denouncing me.[lr]::
22015::$$$message_0198_0008_0001$$$::She's far away.[lr]::
22016::$$$message_0198_0008_0002$$$::In the distance, I can see her staring at me, sad and forlorn.::
22017::$$$message_0198_0009_0000$$$::"Ha...guh...aaah!"[lr]::
22018::$$$message_0198_0009_0001$$$::I push everything from my mind to focus on making my body move.[lr]::
22019::$$$message_0198_0009_0002$$$::Saber's voice is just a distraction.[lr]::
22020::$$$message_0198_0009_0003$$$::Gilgamesh's laughter, the pathetic state my body's in...none of that is my biggest obstacle right now. Right now, it's Saber.::
22021::$$$message_0198_0009_0004$$$::Hearing her say that, seeing her looking like that... It's almost enough to make me give up.[lr]::
22022::$$$message_0198_0009_0005$$$::Finally...[lr]::
22023::$$$message_0198_0009_0006$$$::I feel life flood into my knees. Now all I have to do is get to my feet.::
22024::$$$message_0198_0009_0007$$$::"...I do not need it. I do not need your help. I have lost, and so I am no longer your sword.[lr]::
22025::$$$message_0198_0009_0008$$$::It... It is only proper for me to disappear now!"::
22026::$$$message_0198_0009_0009$$$::It's Saber's voice.[lr]::
22027::$$$message_0198_0009_0010$$$::...Damn.[lr]::
22028::$$$message_0198_0009_0011$$$::[font italic=true]If you keep saying that... If you keep making this even harder, I'll get mad. Even at you...[font italic=false]::
22029::$$$message_0198_0009_0012$$$::"No...please stop, Shirou. You cannot keep going. Really...you will die. If you die this way...this way...I..."::
22030::$$$message_0198_0009_0013$$$::Ungh...[lr]::
22031::$$$message_0198_0009_0014$$$::Ugh, I can't keep listening to this. She has no idea how I feel!::
22032::$$$message_0198_0009_0015$$$::"Shut up! Just be quiet for a minute! There's nothing wrong with relying on me at times like this!"::
22033::$$$message_0198_0009_0016$$$::"That is wrong, Shirou. Please do not twist your priorities so![lr]::
22034::$$$message_0198_0009_0017$$$::You should not concern yourself with me. You must put your life ahead of mine!"::
22035::$$$message_0198_0009_0018$$$::She's pleading with me.[lr]::
22036::$$$message_0198_0009_0019$$$::Knowing that I'm responsible for the agonized sound of her voice makes me want to give up right now.[lr]::
22037::$$$message_0198_0009_0020$$$::But...::
22038::$$$message_0198_0009_0021$$$::"I refuse. There's nothing in the world I want more than you."[lr]::
22039::$$$message_0198_0009_0022$$$::I can't allow myself to give in to her plea.::
22040::$$$message_0198_0009_0023$$$::"What...?"[lr]::
22041::$$$message_0198_0009_0024$$$::Saber gapes at me.[lr]::
22042::$$$message_0198_0009_0025$$$::...I'm not sure why.[lr]::
22043::$$$message_0198_0009_0026$$$::But I remember something.[lr]::
22044::$$$message_0198_0009_0027$$$::She once told me I was a fool who didn't know the value of my own life.::
22045::$$$message_0198_0009_0028$$$::I think she's right.[lr]::
22046::$$$message_0198_0009_0029$$$::For someone who can't help themselves to try to help someone else is a little...presumptuous.[lr]::
22047::$$$message_0198_0009_0030$$$::They're really only doing it for their own happiness, while the person they're meant to be helping may not be half so pleased.::
22048::$$$message_0198_0009_0031$$$::Someone's first priority should be themselves.[lr]::
22049::$$$message_0198_0009_0032$$$::The people who think like that are the ones who can be truly happy, and so they can then share that happiness with other people as well.::
22050::$$$message_0198_0009_0033$$$::"Yeah. I know I'm a fool who doesn't value his own life."[lr]::
22051::$$$message_0198_0009_0034$$$::I've been wrong about the most important thing in my life.[lr]::
22052::$$$message_0198_0009_0035$$$::   From that day...[lr]::
22053::$$$message_0198_0009_0036$$$::...the place in my heart where whatever is most important to me should have been was empty.::
22054::$$$message_0198_0009_0037$$$::But I'm grateful for that abnormality.[lr]::
22055::$$$message_0198_0009_0038$$$::Because now, that empty space...[lr]::
22056::$$$message_0198_0009_0039$$$::...is filled with the person I truly want to save.::
22057::$$$message_0198_0009_0040$$$::"But Saber...even if I'm the most important thing in my life, nothing will change.[lr]::
22058::$$$message_0198_0009_0041$$$::You are so much more beautiful than my life could ever be. Nothing could ever replace you in my heart."::
22059::$$$message_0198_0009_0042$$$::   And then I realize...[lr]::
22060::$$$message_0198_0009_0043$$$::It wasn't that I was sympathetic towards her.::
22061::$$$message_0198_0009_0044$$$::The girl in my dreams...[lr]::
22062::$$$message_0198_0009_0045$$$::That girl who fought and died alone, who I felt was never rewarded for all she did... I was in [font italic=true]awe[font italic=false] of her.[lr]::
22063::$$$message_0198_0009_0046$$$::I thought she was beautiful beyond words.[lr]::
22064::$$$message_0198_0009_0047$$$::The vivid image of her taking her sword and charging into battle, never looking back, was awe-inspiring.::
22065::$$$message_0198_0009_0048$$$::"Yeah. That's why..."[lr]::
22066::$$$message_0198_0009_0049$$$::[font italic=true]That's why I need to protect you, Saber.[font italic=false][lr]::
22067::$$$message_0198_0009_0050$$$::[font italic=true]You were alone your entire life, so I have to make sure you're not swallowed up by the darkness in your last moments.[font italic=false]::
22068::$$$message_0198_0009_0051$$$::...Yep. Once this is all over...on the verge of your death...[lr]::
22069::$$$message_0198_0009_0052$$$::I hope you can go into your eternal slumber, proud of what you did with your life.::
22070::$$$message_0198_0009_0053$$$::No more hesitation.[lr]::
22071::$$$message_0198_0009_0054$$$::My objective is clear.::
22072::$$$message_0198_0010_0000$$$::"Sorry. I love you more than anything, Saber.[lr]::
22073::$$$message_0198_0010_0001$$$::So I'm not letting him take you."[lr]::
22074::$$$message_0198_0010_0002$$$::I regret the apology as soon as I give it.[lr]::
22075::$$$message_0198_0010_0003$$$::But I wanted to tell her.[lr]::
22076::$$$message_0198_0010_0004$$$::I wanted to tell her that, now of all times, because the words could come straight from my heart.::
22077::$$$message_0198_0011_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22078::$$$message_0198_0011_0001$$$::I sense her gasping.[lr]::
22079::$$$message_0198_0011_0002$$$::I want to turn around, to see her face, but no, I can't really see anymore anyway.::
22080::$$$message_0198_0012_0000$$$::I stand up.[lr]::
22081::$$$message_0198_0012_0001$$$::As long as my heart is still beating, I can keep fighting.[lr]::
22082::$$$message_0198_0012_0002$$$::Magical energy is life.[lr]::
22083::$$$message_0198_0012_0003$$$::As long as it flows through me, I can create as many swords for her as she needs.::
22084::$$$message_0198_0013_0000$$$::"Congratulations. You've stood up. Now what? What do you expect to happen here?"[lr]::
22085::$$$message_0198_0013_0001$$$::   I feel a scorching heat in my right hand.[lr]::
22086::$$$message_0198_0013_0002$$$::Here, on the brink of death, I'm reminded of what happened ten years ago.[lr]::
22087::$$$message_0198_0013_0003$$$::...It's a terrible illusion.[lr]::
22088::$$$message_0198_0013_0004$$$::I feel just like I did when I was in the fire, reaching a hand out and hoping to be saved.::
22089::$$$message_0198_0014_0000$$$::"Go away. I can't leave Saber to you."[lr]::
22090::$$$message_0198_0014_0001$$$::I say that as I raise my right hand.[lr]::
22091::$$$message_0198_0014_0002$$$::"Fool. I have no need for your consent."[lr]::
22092::$$$message_0198_0014_0003$$$::Gilgamesh raises his sword.::
22093::$$$message_0198_0015_0000$$$::"Get down, Shirou!!!"[lr]::
22094::$$$message_0198_0015_0001$$$::I hear Saber far behind me.[lr]::
22095::$$$message_0198_0015_0002$$$::I ignore her and use my remaining magical energy to project a sword once more[line2]::
22096::$$$message_0198_0016_0000$$$::The light stops me.[lr]::
22097::$$$message_0198_0016_0001$$$::A vortex of light rushes at me. It's not as strong as Excalibur, but it still burns away anything it touches.[lr]::
22098::$$$message_0198_0016_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22099::$$$message_0198_0016_0003$$$::When the heat scorches my body, I don't think about my death; I think about Saber, somewhere behind me.::
22100::$$$message_0198_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22101::$$$message_0198_0017_0001$$$::This will kill her as well as me.[lr]::
22102::$$$message_0198_0017_0002$$$::I at least need to protect her, then.[lr]::
22103::$$$message_0198_0017_0003$$$::I said it's what I'd do. It's...what I've always wanted to do.::
22104::$$$message_0198_0018_0000$$$::She's strong, but at the same time, could break at any moment.[lr]::
22105::$$$message_0198_0018_0001$$$::She needs me.[lr]::
22106::$$$message_0198_0018_0002$$$::She's like a drawn sword, so to make sure she doesn't get hurt, I'll sheathe her...::
22107::$$$message_0198_0019_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
22108::$$$message_0198_0019_0001$$$::Before I realize what's going on, there's a sword in my right hand.::
22109::$$$message_0198_0020_0000$$$::"Wha...t!?"[lr]::
22110::$$$message_0198_0020_0001$$$::I'm not sure who said that.[lr]::
22111::$$$message_0198_0020_0002$$$::But there is a brief hesitation.[lr]::
22112::$$$message_0198_0020_0003$$$::At the same moment, the invincible knight in gold takes a step backward.[lr]::
22113::$$$message_0198_0020_0004$$$::"Shirou...allow me...!"[lr]::
22114::$$$message_0198_0020_0005$$$::Saber takes my hand.::
22115::$$$message_0198_0021_0000$$$::The vortex of light fades.[lr]::
22116::$$$message_0198_0021_0001$$$::Saber is right beside me.[lr]::
22117::$$$message_0198_0021_0002$$$::Before me is Gilgamesh, eyes open...and bleeding.::
22118::$$$message_0198_0022_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22119::$$$message_0198_0022_0001$$$::I don't know what happened.[lr]::
22120::$$$message_0198_0022_0002$$$::But I realize it's just like the Berserker battle.[lr]::
22121::$$$message_0198_0022_0003$$$::Saber is using whatever I made, and it destroyed Gilgamesh's Gram.[lr]::
22122::$$$message_0198_0022_0004$$$::Two titanic beams of light collide before one overwhelms the other and we manage to truly wound the man who, until now, had been completely unscathed.::
22123::$$$message_0198_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
22124::$$$message_0198_0023_0001$$$::He [font italic=true]radiates[font italic=false] murderous intent. It is terrifying.[lr]::
22125::$$$message_0198_0023_0002$$$::In spite of that ferocious, murderous rage...[lr]::
22126::$$$message_0198_0023_0003$$$::...the golden knight leaves without a word.::
22127::$$$message_0198_0024_0000$$$::"...Eh?"[lr]::
22128::$$$message_0198_0024_0001$$$::But there's no time to be surprised.[lr]::
22129::$$$message_0198_0024_0002$$$::I have no idea why he just left.[lr]::
22130::$$$message_0198_0024_0003$$$::But, even as I feel myself slipping into unconsciousness, I know the battle's over.::
22131::$$$message_0198_0025_0000$$$::My knees buckle.[lr]::
22132::$$$message_0198_0025_0001$$$::The tension that kept me upright fades, and I collapse.[lr]::
22133::$$$message_0198_0025_0002$$$::"Shirou...!"::
22134::$$$message_0198_0026_0000$$$::Saber hurries forward and catches me.[lr]::
22135::$$$message_0198_0026_0001$$$::While I slip down onto my rear, supported by Saber, I look over my body.::
22136::$$$message_0198_0027_0000$$$::"Ha..."[lr]::
22137::$$$message_0198_0027_0001$$$::I can't help but cry out.[lr]::
22138::$$$message_0198_0027_0002$$$::My body is torn to pieces.[lr]::
22139::$$$message_0198_0027_0003$$$::"Ahhh...ha...haaa...ha..."[lr]::
22140::$$$message_0198_0027_0004$$$::I should have been killed the instant Gilgamesh laid me open from shoulder to hip.::
22141::$$$message_0198_0028_0000$$$::"Tch...ah...well this is definitely..."[lr]::
22142::$$$message_0198_0028_0001$$$::My healing power must be what's got me clinging to life, but even that has its limits.[lr]::
22143::$$$message_0198_0028_0002$$$::I'm practically split in two.[lr]::
22144::$$$message_0198_0028_0003$$$::I can't possibly recover from this.[lr]::
22145::$$$message_0198_0028_0004$$$::I'm not even sure if I'm breathing, and everything is starting to go dark.::
22146::$$$message_0198_0029_0000$$$::   My end is near.[lr]::
22147::$$$message_0198_0029_0001$$$::The only good thing to come from this is that Saber is okay.[lr]::
22148::$$$message_0198_0029_0002$$$::My wounds are fatal, but it looks like Saber was just exhausted.[lr]::
22149::$$$message_0198_0029_0003$$$::She's disarmed, and her wounds are already healed.[lr]::
22150::$$$message_0198_0029_0004$$$::Even if I end up having to drop out of the war, I'm sure Tohsaka can take care of the rest.::
22151::$$$message_0198_0030_0000$$$::I hear that sound again.[lr]::
22152::$$$message_0198_0030_0001$$$::That sound of creaking bones...is coming from me.[lr]::
22153::$$$message_0198_0030_0002$$$::Curious, I look down at my wounds.::
22154::$$$message_0198_0031_0000$$$::"...What?"[lr]::
22155::$$$message_0198_0031_0001$$$::I see myriad swords.[lr]::
22156::$$$message_0198_0031_0002$$$::Or...I see what looks like tons of tiny blades converging, layering atop each other, trying to knit together my broken body.::
22157::$$$message_0198_0032_0000$$$::I feel faint.[lr]::
22158::$$$message_0198_0032_0001$$$::It looks like every muscle and bone in my body is made from...swords.::
22159::$$$message_0198_0033_0000$$$::"Eh...?"[lr]::
22160::$$$message_0198_0033_0001$$$::The next moment, they're gone.[lr]::
22161::$$$message_0198_0033_0002$$$::My body looks normal, and what I thought I saw a moment ago seems to have only been an illusion.[lr]::
22162::$$$message_0198_0033_0003$$$::As proof of that, my ruined flesh begins fusing together. My wounds close right before my eyes.[lr]::
22163::$$$message_0198_0033_0004$$$::It's...more like restoration rather than healing.[lr]::
22164::$$$message_0198_0033_0005$$$::Looking at it, I feel a surge of disgust rather than fascination.::
22165::$$$message_0198_0034_0000$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
22166::$$$message_0198_0034_0001$$$::Looks like I'm going to make it.[lr]::
22167::$$$message_0198_0034_0002$$$::But this is just too[line2][lr]::
22168::$$$message_0198_0034_0003$$$::"What a relief. It appears you will not die, Master."[lr]::
22169::$$$message_0198_0034_0004$$$::I hear Saber's voice at my ear.[lr]::
22170::$$$message_0198_0034_0005$$$::She's, uh...really close.::
22171::$$$message_0198_0035_0000$$$::"Uh...well, that's great. But my body...what's..."[lr]::
22172::$$$message_0198_0035_0001$$$::I want to ask what's going on with my body, but I'm suddenly overcome with dizziness.::
22173::$$$message_0198_0036_0000$$$::And then...[lr]::
22174::$$$message_0198_0036_0001$$$::My body is enveloped in a soft embrace.::

22176::$$$message_0198_0037_0001$$$::"No. I understand now. It makes sense for your wounds to be healing."::
