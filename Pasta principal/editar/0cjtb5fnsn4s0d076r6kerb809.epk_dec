40105::$$$message_0345_0000_0000$$$::    It is a silent night.[lr]::
40106::$$$message_0345_0000_0001$$$::The wind blowing through the mountain forest is gentle, and the rustling of the trees is as faint as a whisper.[lr]::
40107::$$$message_0345_0000_0002$$$::There are no birds singing about winter or beasts howling at the moon.[lr]::
40108::$$$message_0345_0000_0003$$$::There is only one passage that leads to the Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
40109::$$$message_0345_0000_0004$$$::The long stone stairs remain peaceful tonight as well.::
40110::$$$message_0345_0001_0000$$$::But others do not know.[lr]::
40111::$$$message_0345_0001_0001$$$::This place has already withstood five wars, each one a fight to the death.[lr]::
40112::$$$message_0345_0001_0002$$$::Many Servants have challenged the Ryudou Temple.[lr]::
40113::$$$message_0345_0001_0003$$$::Berserker, Lancer, Rider, Saber, and Archer.[lr]::
40114::$$$message_0345_0001_0004$$$::The mountain is able to calmly enjoy the darkness thanks to the sorcerer that completely drove those five away.::
40115::$$$message_0345_0002_0000$$$::The longsword moves.[lr]::
40116::$$$message_0345_0002_0001$$$::Fortunately, it was a moonless night.[lr]::
40117::$$$message_0345_0002_0002$$$::The crescent-shaped arc of the the moving sword is so elegant that the moon would be ashamed of itself if it saw it.::
40118::$$$message_0345_0003_0000$$$::"Are you listening, Assassin? I told you that you will continue guarding the gate."[lr]::
40119::$$$message_0345_0003_0001$$$::He ignores the purple mage, Caster.[lr]::
40120::$$$message_0345_0003_0002$$$::Assassin lowers his longsword and glances at the forest without interest.[lr]::
40121::$$$message_0345_0003_0003$$$::"Well, there was an intruder. I saw a strange bird so I tried slashing at it, but it did not bleed nor scream. Is this one of yours, Caster?"::
40122::$$$message_0345_0004_0000$$$::"Oh...! ...Yes, this must have been a familiar spying on us. It must be Berserker's Master or that young lady. Either way, this place will not last for long."[lr]::
40123::$$$message_0345_0004_0001$$$::Caster walks to the forest and looks down at the thing fallen on the ground.[lr]::
40124::$$$message_0345_0004_0002$$$::It is the corpse of an owl.[lr]::
40125::$$$message_0345_0004_0003$$$::A bird made out of crystal. A simple, yet excellent spying creation probably made by Archer's Master.::
40126::$$$message_0345_0005_0000$$$::"...Heh. That young lady has no luck. I could have made her my student if she was a bit more incompetent."[lr]::
40127::$$$message_0345_0005_0001$$$::She steps on it.[lr]::
40128::$$$message_0345_0005_0002$$$::The amethyst crystals are crushed to pieces and scattered on the ground, shining like stars.::
40129::$$$message_0345_0006_0000$$$::"There are many fellows like this, so I will leave you in charge of guarding my Master, Assassin. I will disappear if my Master dies. If that happens, you cannot exist either.[lr]::
40130::$$$message_0345_0006_0001$$$::If you do not want to disappear, protect this gate with your life."::
40131::$$$message_0345_0007_0000$$$::"Well... It is difficult to protect it with my life. I have never felt like I was 'alive' ever since I was born.[lr]::
40132::$$$message_0345_0007_0001$$$:: Is it not meaningless to order such a thing from one such as I?"[lr]::
40133::$$$message_0345_0007_0002$$$::"...Stop your impudent talk.[lr]::
40134::$$$message_0345_0007_0003$$$::Do not misunderstand, Assassin. You are a Servant I summoned. A Servant should act like a slave.[lr]::
40135::$$$message_0345_0007_0004$$$::Look, if you cannot swear your loyalty to your Master, you can disappear right now."::
40136::$$$message_0345_0008_0000$$$::There is only enmity and contempt in Caster's voice.[lr]::
40137::$$$message_0345_0008_0001$$$::To her, Assassin is only a tool.[lr]::
40138::$$$message_0345_0008_0002$$$::It is annoying enough for a tool to be talking, so it is natural for her to get irritated when it starts talking sarcastically.::
40139::$$$message_0345_0009_0000$$$::"I see, good heavens. My life is like a mayfly, but it would be troublesome if I disappeared now. I have made a promise. If I can, I would like to fulfill this promise."[lr]::
40140::$$$message_0345_0009_0001$$$::"...Then watch what you say. You only need to protect this place.[lr]::
40141::$$$message_0345_0009_0002$$$::Yes, in the event that you are able to do so, I can make you real. If a low-class like you without a Noble Phantasm can become a Heroic Spirit, then it should be worth risking your life, right?"::
40142::$$$message_0345_0010_0000$$$::"You do not need to worry. I have belonged to the other world from the beginning, so I shall carry out the role that has been given to me.[lr]::
40143::$$$message_0345_0010_0001$$$::But, is it all right, Caster? I am not loyal to my Master either, but are you not being dishonest as well? Tonight's matter is a secret from your Master, correct?"[lr]::
40144::$$$message_0345_0010_0002$$$::At that instant, Assassin's body explodes.[lr]::
40145::$$$message_0345_0010_0003$$$::An explosive sound.[lr]::
40146::$$$message_0345_0010_0004$$$::The curse Caster implanted into his body when he was summoned has exploded.::
40147::$$$message_0345_0011_0000$$$::The trees sway.[lr]::
40148::$$$message_0345_0011_0001$$$::Assassin is blown away and slammed into the forest, his chest pierced by his own ribs.[lr]::
40149::$$$message_0345_0011_0002$$$::His figure looks like a blooming flower.::
40150::$$$message_0345_0012_0000$$$::"Guh... This again. You are getting worse by the day, Caster."[lr]::
40151::$$$message_0345_0012_0001$$$::"...Quiet. If I have to tell you one more time, I will eliminate you before waiting five days."[lr]::
40152::$$$message_0345_0012_0002$$$::"...Geez. They say that women and immoral people are unmanageable, but you have gone too far."::
40153::$$$message_0345_0013_0000$$$::The flashy Servant stands up slowly.[lr]::
40154::$$$message_0345_0013_0001$$$::Even though his ribs are coming out of his chest and he's bloody all over, this Servant does not lose his elegance.::
40155::$$$message_0345_0014_0000$$$::"Oh, do not glare at me with those eyes. Your beautiful face is ruined, Caster. I know, everything is to be a secret from your Master, right? I will hide the fact that you have captured Saber and that you have me as a guard.[lr]::
40156::$$$message_0345_0014_0001$$$::It is a moving story. I hope that your caring spirit towards your Master reaches him."[lr]::
40157::$$$message_0345_0014_0002$$$::"...Assassin, you..."::
40158::$$$message_0345_0015_0000$$$::"What, I am just being a sore loser. I cannot attack you, so at least allow me to joke around like that.[lr]::
40159::$$$message_0345_0015_0001$$$::...I will protect the gate. I shall protect it no matter what.[lr]::
40160::$$$message_0345_0015_0002$$$::But, where are you going to go? Do you not trust my protection?"::
40161::$$$message_0345_0016_0000$$$::"...Of course not. You are just insurance.[lr]::
40162::$$$message_0345_0016_0001$$$::But, that is over. Once I get hold of Saber, I won't need to make this rustic place my temple." [lr]::
40163::$$$message_0345_0016_0002$$$::"...Hm, so you will relocate? In that case, I certainly am not needed. Is there a sacred place superior to this mountain?"[lr]::
40164::$$$message_0345_0016_0003$$$::"Yes. It is slightly inferior, but I have a place that suits me. Besides... I will be going there sooner or later anyways. There is no problem if I go there now, right?"::
40165::$$$message_0345_0017_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
40166::$$$message_0345_0017_0001$$$::Assassin's expression, which has been cool throughout, clouds up.[lr]::
40167::$$$message_0345_0017_0002$$$::Caster must have been satisfied to see that, as her glossy lips smile.::
40168::$$$message_0345_0018_0000$$$::"I see. Our victory is certain, so I am going to go get my prize ahead of time.[lr]::
40169::$$$message_0345_0018_0001$$$::A new territory and the Holy Grail. I even have another piece called Saber now. With this, I am sure my reluctant Master won't complain about my policy, right?" ::
40170::$$$message_0345_0019_0000$$$::That is true.[lr]::
40171::$$$message_0345_0019_0001$$$::No matter how much Caster's Master, Souichirou Kuzuki, wants to stay silent, he will have no choice but to fight if the conditions line up so perfectly.[lr]::
40172::$$$message_0345_0019_0002$$$::But, what is more certain than that is...::
40173::$$$message_0345_0020_0000$$$::"...This silly battle will be over. There is nothing to fear once I obtain the Holy Grail.[lr]::
40174::$$$message_0345_0020_0001$$$::...Yes, no one will be able to stop me, no matter who they are...!"::
40175::$$$message_0345_0021_0000$$$::Her loud laughter soils the night.[lr]::
40176::$$$message_0345_0021_0001$$$::The purple mage expresses her victory proudly.[lr]::
40177::$$$message_0345_0021_0002$$$::The swordsman with the longsword gives her a side glance and looks up at the sky.::
40178::$$$message_0345_0022_0000$$$::    The time is near.[lr]::
40179::$$$message_0345_0022_0001$$$::No matter what the result may be, there are only five days remaining.[lr]::
40180::$$$message_0345_0022_0002$$$::Even though the number of days are unlikely to be used up, the swordsman who had survived the bloodbath felt that this would be a battle that could not be easily resolved.::
