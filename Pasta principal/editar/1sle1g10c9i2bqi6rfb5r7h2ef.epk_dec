70541::$$$message_0646_0000_0001$$$::Huh? Master, why aren't you mad at him for being a coward like always?::
70542::$$$message_0646_0000_0002$$$::Because this conclusion is, in its own way, a peaceful death.[lr]::
70543::$$$message_0646_0000_0003$$$::You could say that this is Saber's ending in "Heaven's Feel."::
70544::$$$message_0646_0000_0004$$$::Huh. Well, Shirou did beat Saber one-on-one, so he got something out of it.::
70545::$$$message_0646_0000_0005$$$::Yup.[lr]::
70546::$$$message_0646_0000_0006$$$::Still, we're going to train like we always do.[lr]::

70551::$$$message_0646_0000_0011$$$::Friends/Enemies!::
70552::$$$message_0646_0000_0012$$$::Frenemies? Sounds like an oxymoron!::
70553::$$$message_0646_0000_0013$$$::Cut out the half-assed jokes!::
70554::$$$message_0646_0000_0014$$$::In a word, what you need here is a partner![lr]::

70556::$$$message_0646_0000_0016$$$::Find a way to convince her to help you in the final battle!::
70557::$$$message_0646_0000_0017$$$::Yes ma'am... But she always runs away, you know.::
70558::$$$message_0646_0000_0018$$$::Think back to your earlier conversations with her. If you give her the answer she wants, she'll be your friend.::
70559::$$$message_0646_0000_0019$$$::That's all for this Dojo.::
70560::$$$message_0646_0000_0020$$$::Just a little more until you reach the denouement of the battle![lr]::
