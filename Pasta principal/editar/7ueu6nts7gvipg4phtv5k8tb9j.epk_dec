7555::$$$message_0071_0000_0000$$$::I'm dreaming.[lr]::
7556::$$$message_0071_0000_0001$$$::It must because my blood is feverish, and my entire body is throbbing.[lr]::
7557::$$$message_0071_0000_0002$$$::Something I'd rather not have to remember plays out in my dream.::
7558::$$$message_0071_0001_0000$$$::This is my oldest memory.[lr]::
7559::$$$message_0071_0001_0001$$$::It's also a memory I can't escape.[lr]::
7560::$$$message_0071_0001_0002$$$::It's a scene from ten years ago, and one I usually try not to think back on. I can't ever erase it from my memory though.[lr]::
7561::$$$message_0071_0001_0003$$$::It's not that I forgot.[lr]::
7562::$$$message_0071_0001_0004$$$::It's not even that I want to forget.[lr]::
7563::$$$message_0071_0001_0005$$$::It's just that it's already happened.::
7564::$$$message_0071_0002_0000$$$::So it's not especially painful.[lr]::
7565::$$$message_0071_0002_0001$$$::And I don't really feel all that angry about it either.::
7566::$$$message_0071_0003_0000$$$::The past is the past.[lr]::
7567::$$$message_0071_0003_0001$$$::I can't return to it; I can't redo it.[lr]::
7568::$$$message_0071_0003_0002$$$::All that happened is that I escaped, and lived on.[lr]::
7569::$$$message_0071_0003_0003$$$::Looking forward is all I can do.::
7570::$$$message_0071_0004_0000$$$::Nobody told me to do that.[lr]::
7571::$$$message_0071_0004_0001$$$::But I've thought about that, even if just vaguely, since I was a kid.[lr]::
7572::$$$message_0071_0004_0002$$$::I can't forget or deny the past.[lr]::
7573::$$$message_0071_0004_0003$$$::The only way to keep the memory of what we lost alive is to acknowledge it.::
7574::$$$message_0071_0005_0000$$$::"It's...hot."[lr]::
7575::$$$message_0071_0005_0001$$$::I wake up to find my body is still burning up.[lr]::
7576::$$$message_0071_0005_0002$$$::I must have wound up falling asleep out in the cool air last night.::
7577::$$$message_0071_0006_0000$$$::Inside this dimly lit shed with me and[line2]::
7578::$$$message_0071_0007_0000$$$::"S-Saber!?"[lr]::
7579::$$$message_0071_0007_0001$$$::"You've awoken, Shirou. I do not mind you sneaking away from your room, but I do not approve of you sleeping in a place like this."::
7580::$$$message_0071_0008_0000$$$::"Oh, morning. Well, I was burning up last night, and when I went outside, I got sleepy."::
7581::$$$message_0071_0009_0000$$$::"I can see that. You do not have to explain yourself, but please do be careful next time. My Master sleeping in such a place puts me in an awkward position."::
7582::$$$message_0071_0010_0000$$$::"Ugh...sorry. I'll try to sleep in my own room next time."[lr]::
7583::$$$message_0071_0010_0001$$$::"That would be very helpful, yes.[lr]::
7584::$$$message_0071_0010_0002$$$::By the way, Shirou, Taiga has been calling for you for a while now."::
7585::$$$message_0071_0011_0000$$$::"Fuji-nee? What's she want?"[lr]::
7586::$$$message_0071_0011_0001$$$::"It may be about breakfast. It is long past breakfast time."[lr]::
7587::$$$message_0071_0011_0002$$$::"Eh!? What, it's already past seven!? Crap...I overslept!"::
7588::$$$message_0071_0012_0000$$$::"Yes. It is quite unusual for you to be the last to wake up. Your training with Rin last night must have affected you rather a lot."[lr]::
7589::$$$message_0071_0012_0001$$$::Saber provides a calm analysis of the situation.[lr]::
7590::$$$message_0071_0012_0002$$$::But I don't have time for idle chitchat.::
7591::$$$message_0071_0013_0000$$$::"I know you went out of your way to wake me up, but go on back ahead of me. I'll hurry up and get changed, then head to the kitchen."[lr]::
7592::$$$message_0071_0013_0001$$$::"Very well. I will do what I can to calm Taiga down."::
7593::$$$message_0071_0014_0000$$$::Saber turns and heads back to the house.[lr]::
7594::$$$message_0071_0014_0001$$$::Calm Fuji-nee? Saber sure has adapted well to our morning routine...::
7595::$$$message_0071_0015_0000$$$::I dash to the kitchen.[lr]::
7596::$$$message_0071_0015_0001$$$::I ignore Fuji-nee's jeers, and prepare breakfast as quickly as I can.::
7597::$$$message_0071_0016_0000$$$::"Sorry to keep you waiting. There's not much time before school starts, so hurry up and eat."[lr]::
7598::$$$message_0071_0016_0001$$$::I plop breakfast onto the table.[lr]::
7599::$$$message_0071_0016_0002$$$::"What...!?"[lr]::
7600::$$$message_0071_0016_0003$$$::Suddenly...::
7601::$$$message_0071_0017_0000$$$::"What the hell is this!?"[lr]::
7602::$$$message_0071_0017_0001$$$::Fuji-nee explodes, practically spitting fire.::
7603::$$$message_0071_0018_0000$$$::"What is this!? It's just toast! Shirou, why is this all there is for breakfast today!?"::
7604::$$$message_0071_0019_0000$$$::"Hey. I overslept. I don't have time to make anything else, and a breakfast with toast is typically just that. It's just missing salad and eggs, so there's not a huge difference."::
7605::$$$message_0071_0020_0000$$$::"There's a BIG difference![lr]::
7606::$$$message_0071_0020_0001$$$::Everyone else agrees, right!?"[lr]::
7607::$$$message_0071_0020_0002$$$::Fuji-nee tries to appeal to Saber and Tohsaka, who both eat in silence.[lr]::
7608::$$$message_0071_0020_0003$$$::This isn't going to go in her favor.[lr]::
7609::$$$message_0071_0020_0004$$$::Neither of them is as gluttonous as Fuji-nee. She's barking up the wrong tree.::
7610::$$$message_0071_0021_0000$$$::"She may be right. I'm not Miss Fujimura, but I don't know if I can tolerate such laziness. I can only assume you're insulting bread as a breakfast choice."[lr]::
7611::$$$message_0071_0021_0001$$$::...Hey wait a minute.[lr]::
7612::$$$message_0071_0021_0002$$$::I thought she didn't eat breakfast to begin with!?::
7613::$$$message_0071_0022_0000$$$::"...Hnn..."[lr]::
7614::$$$message_0071_0022_0001$$$::Now why's [font italic=true]she[font italic=false] sighing, all disappointed!? That's way out of character.::
7615::$$$message_0071_0023_0000$$$::"See? Everyone thinks you're in the wrong. Majority rules here, so you'd best think on what you've done, then make a proper breakfast for us."[lr]::
7616::$$$message_0071_0023_0001$$$::"That's so unfair! Besides, if I start making a dish now, you're going to be late, Fuji-nee. It's already seven-thirty, so you need to do the whole running out of the house with a piece of toast hanging from your mouth thing! Give it up!"::
7617::$$$message_0071_0024_0000$$$::"Fine. If I have to choose between being late or being hungry, I choose breakfast."[lr]::
7618::$$$message_0071_0024_0001$$$::"That's nuts! What kind of teacher even are you!? Just eat your toast and go to school! I absolutely refuse to make anything else, even if it kills me!"::
7619::$$$message_0071_0025_0000$$$::"Geez, you really do get worked up over nothing. Keep talking like an old man, and you'll become one real quick."::
7620::$$$message_0071_0026_0000$$$::"You don't need to remind me. Thanks to you, I'm practically an old man already."[lr]::
7621::$$$message_0071_0026_0001$$$::I huff and take a bite of toast.[lr]::
7622::$$$message_0071_0026_0002$$$::Okay, she...might be right.[lr]::
7623::$$$message_0071_0026_0003$$$::There is something kind of sad about there being so many people here, and then only having toast for breakfast.::
