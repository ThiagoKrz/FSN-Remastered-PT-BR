16807::$$$message_0153_0000_0000$$$::Kiritsugu always told me to protect girls, and I don't like seeing kids suffer.::
16808::$$$message_0153_0001_0000$$$::"Uh... Well, I think Illya should stay here.[lr]::
16809::$$$message_0153_0001_0001$$$::The Holy Grail War isn't over. I want to shelter Illya until the last of the Masters are taken care of."::
16810::$$$message_0153_0002_0000$$$::"Yep! If Shirou says so, I'll stay here!"[lr]::
16811::$$$message_0153_0002_0001$$$::"Hey! Illya, you're choking me! I can't breathe!"::
16812::$$$message_0153_0003_0000$$$::I intend to pry off Illya from me, but before I get a chance, Saber steps over and does it for me.::

16816::$$$message_0153_0006_0001$$$::Besides, how would you feel if she got attacked after we abandoned her? Illya's life would be in danger, and the other Masters might gain power from her."::
16817::$$$message_0153_0007_0000$$$::"Ugh...yes, that might be true, but..."[lr]::
16818::$$$message_0153_0007_0001$$$::Saber hesitates.[lr]::
16819::$$$message_0153_0007_0002$$$::No matter what she says, Saber understands that another Master might attack Illya if we leave her alone.::
