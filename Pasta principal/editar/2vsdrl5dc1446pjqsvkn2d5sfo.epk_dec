42548::$$$message_0373_0000_0000$$$::    Meet up with Tohsaka.[lr]::
42549::$$$message_0373_0000_0001$$$::She told me to withdraw now.[lr]::
42550::$$$message_0373_0000_0002$$$::If I'm going to refuse and fight, I need to let her know.[lr]::
42551::$$$message_0373_0000_0003$$$::That I won't withdraw on my own, and that we're still cooperating.[lr]::
42552::$$$message_0373_0000_0004$$$::And...::
42553::$$$message_0373_0001_0000$$$::I can't let her fight by herself.[lr]::
42554::$$$message_0373_0001_0001$$$::I owe her big time.[lr]::
42555::$$$message_0373_0001_0002$$$::I can't step down until I repay her for that.::
42556::$$$message_0373_0002_0000$$$::"...And she always screws up at the most crucial moment... She's so unreliable, I can't let her be alone."[lr]::
42557::$$$message_0373_0002_0001$$$::I adjust the bag on my shoulder.[lr]::
42558::$$$message_0373_0002_0002$$$::...I'm aware that I won't be of much help and that she will object.[lr]::
42559::$$$message_0373_0002_0003$$$::But I can't obtain peace of mind until I see Tohsaka's face.::
42560::$$$message_0373_0003_0000$$$::...This is hypothetical, but...[lr]::
42561::$$$message_0373_0003_0001$$$::If she gets hurt without me knowing, I can't even be there to help her...::
42562::$$$message_0373_0004_0000$$$::"...Phew."[lr]::
42563::$$$message_0373_0004_0001$$$::I sit down on a bench and rest my burning body.[lr]::
42564::$$$message_0373_0004_0002$$$::It's past noon.[lr]::
42565::$$$message_0373_0004_0003$$$::I've searched all around Shinto, but I haven't found anything.::
42566::$$$message_0373_0005_0000$$$::"...Damn. I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but I didn't think I would find nothing."[lr]::
42567::$$$message_0373_0005_0001$$$::I knew that I had no way to find Tohsaka from the start.[lr]::
42568::$$$message_0373_0005_0002$$$::I tested my luck and looked around town, but I couldn't find her or even traces of her.::
42569::$$$message_0373_0006_0000$$$::"...The other Masters aren't coming out either... I guess there's no need to even attack me now that I don't have a Command Spell."[lr]::
42570::$$$message_0373_0006_0001$$$::I take a deep breath and lean back on the backrest.::
42571::$$$message_0373_0007_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42572::$$$message_0373_0007_0001$$$::I won't get anywhere like this.[lr]::
42573::$$$message_0373_0007_0002$$$::Tohsaka isn't naïve enough to show her tail, and my last resort to use myself as decoy to lure other Masters is failing so far.::
42574::$$$message_0373_0008_0000$$$::...I get a bit uneasy.[lr]::
42575::$$$message_0373_0008_0001$$$::I can't find Tohsaka and can't save Saber.[lr]::
42576::$$$message_0373_0008_0002$$$::They might already be in an irreparable situation by the time I find them...::
42577::$$$message_0373_0009_0000$$$::"...It's still noon. I won't let that happen so easily."[lr]::
42578::$$$message_0373_0009_0001$$$::I stand up from the bench.[lr]::
42579::$$$message_0373_0009_0002$$$::I ignore my left shoulder that starts heating up again and leave the park.::
42580::$$$message_0373_0010_0000$$$::I'll search one more time from the start.[lr]::
42581::$$$message_0373_0010_0001$$$::There's no doubt that she's in Shinto.[lr]::
42582::$$$message_0373_0010_0002$$$::It's the same as last night.[lr]::
42583::$$$message_0373_0010_0003$$$::I don't know why, but I can instinctively feel that she[line2]no, he[line2]is around here.[lr]::
42584::$$$message_0373_0010_0004$$$::It's not as uncertain as a premonition, but close to conviction.::
