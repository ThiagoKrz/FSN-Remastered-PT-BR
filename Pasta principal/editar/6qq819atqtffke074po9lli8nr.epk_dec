58054::$$$message_0518_0000_0001$$$::She's older, and she might have an easier time convincing Sakura.::
58055::$$$message_0518_0001_0000$$$::"Fuji-nee, about Sakura staying over, could you ask her for me?"[lr]::
58056::$$$message_0518_0001_0001$$$::"Why? I don't wanna get kicked by a horse.[lr]::
58057::$$$message_0518_0001_0002$$$::You should be the one to break it to her, Shirou."::

58060::$$$message_0518_0002_0002$$$::...If the stakes were lower then it'd be easier, but I can't afford to have her say no this time."::

58068::$$$message_0518_0005_0002$$$::"I'll tell her now. You focus on making dinner."[lr]::
58069::$$$message_0518_0005_0003$$$::Fuji-nee unenthusiastically gets up to greet Sakura.[lr]::
