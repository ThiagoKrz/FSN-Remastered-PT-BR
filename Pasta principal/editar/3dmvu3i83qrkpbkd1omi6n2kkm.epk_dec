6687::$$$message_0060_0000_0000$$$::It's two o'clock.[lr]::
6688::$$$message_0060_0000_0001$$$::There's no sign of Tohsaka returning, so I just focus on finishing my assignment.::
6689::$$$message_0060_0001_0000$$$::"Oh, the phone's ringing."[lr]::
6690::$$$message_0060_0001_0001$$$::The ringing just reaches my ears from elsewhere in the house.::
6691::$$$message_0060_0002_0000$$$::"It's in the living room. Tohsaka can[line2]no, she won't dare pick up a phone in someone else's house."[lr]::
6692::$$$message_0060_0002_0001$$$::I doubt it's an important phone call, but I shouldn't ignore it.[lr]::
6693::$$$message_0060_0002_0002$$$::I stand up, and head to the living room to answer the phone.::
6694::$$$message_0060_0003_0000$$$::There's nobody in the living room.[lr]::
6695::$$$message_0060_0003_0001$$$::Saber and Tohsaka must be in the courtyard.::
6696::$$$message_0060_0004_0000$$$::"Hello, Emiya residence."[lr]::
6697::$$$message_0060_0004_0001$$$::"Hey there Emiya. I hear you're not at school again today. Are you sick or something?"[lr]::
6698::$$$message_0060_0004_0002$$$::All of a sudden...[lr]::
6699::$$$message_0060_0004_0003$$$::Shinji's voice sounds from the other end of the line, heavy with barely restrained laughter.::
6700::$$$message_0060_0005_0000$$$::"Is that you, Shinji? What do you want? I don't think we have anything to talk about."[lr]::
6701::$$$message_0060_0005_0001$$$::"Why the cold reception? I thought I'd call you to tell you something."::
6702::$$$message_0060_0006_0000$$$::"Tell me something...?"[lr]::
6703::$$$message_0060_0006_0001$$$::"Yeah. There was something I wanted to tell you, but you haven't been to school.[lr]::
6704::$$$message_0060_0006_0002$$$::I don't want to drag this out, so I called. Couldn't wait any longer. Is...Tohsaka around?"::
6705::$$$message_0060_0007_0000$$$::...Shinji sounds kind of odd.[lr]::
6706::$$$message_0060_0007_0001$$$::He seems weirdly excited.::
6707::$$$message_0060_0008_0000$$$::I can hear other students in the background, so he must still be at school.[lr]::
6708::$$$message_0060_0008_0001$$$::It's a little past two. Fifth period should be over, so I think it's break time right now.::
6709::$$$message_0060_0009_0000$$$::"Hey, are you listening, Emiya? Is Tohsaka there or not?"[lr]::
6710::$$$message_0060_0009_0001$$$::"Not right now. She just stepped away."[lr]::
6711::$$$message_0060_0009_0002$$$::"Okay, great. I only wanted to talk to you. I'm going to tell you something real good, so why don't you come to school right now? But come without telling Tohsaka, obviously."::
6712::$$$message_0060_0010_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
6713::$$$message_0060_0010_0001$$$::I don't know how to respond to that.[lr]::
6714::$$$message_0060_0010_0002$$$::Shinji's acting weird, and we're already talking.[lr]::
6715::$$$message_0060_0010_0003$$$::I don't see any reason to go all the way to school, and if I take off without telling Tohsaka, it'd feel like a betrayal.::
6716::$$$message_0060_0011_0000$$$::"Sorry, but I can't go to school. If you have something for me, it'll have to wait until next week. I'll go back to school after the weekend."[lr]::
6717::$$$message_0060_0011_0001$$$::"Huh? Who put you in charge!?[lr]::
6718::$$$message_0060_0011_0002$$$::And that'll be too late. I [font italic=true]just said[font italic=false] I can't wait any longer!"::
6719::$$$message_0060_0012_0000$$$::Shinji's yelling now.[lr]::
6720::$$$message_0060_0012_0001$$$::He must be really excited, because I can hear his heavy breathing over the phone.::
6721::$$$message_0060_0013_0000$$$::"Heh. So you're finally using your head. Yeah, you're right. There's no way you would come on your own at this point. This whole conversation's pretty suspicious, so of course you'd think it was bad news."[lr]::
6722::$$$message_0060_0013_0001$$$::His tone shifts entirely, and he even starts laughing.::
6723::$$$message_0060_0014_0000$$$::"Hold on a minute. Calm down. You're acting real strange, Shinji. I don't know what happened but[line2]"::
6724::$$$message_0060_0015_0000$$$::"Ahahahahaha! Don't lie, Emiya. Knowing Tohsaka, I bet she told you everything! You don't need to hide it from me. Yeah, you're Saber's Master, after all. That means you're much, [font italic=true]much[font italic=false] more of a murderer than I am!"::
6725::$$$message_0060_0016_0000$$$::Shinji seems to be enjoying himself.[lr]::
6726::$$$message_0060_0016_0001$$$::I've known him for about five years now, but I've never seen him so wound up.::
6727::$$$message_0060_0017_0000$$$::"Shinji, are you..."[lr]::
6728::$$$message_0060_0017_0001$$$::"Just come to school, okay? And hurry, Emiya. You should be able to make it by sixth period. It's Fujimura's class anyway, so you won't get in trouble for being a bit late."::
6729::$$$message_0060_0018_0000$$$::"Well, even Fuji-nee would get mad if we were late for her class. And I might get even more of an earful if I only showed up for sixth period rather than just missing the whole day."::
6730::$$$message_0060_0019_0000$$$::"That's your own fault. Oh and if you tell Tohsaka, then I'm ending our friendship for real. I turned a blind eye to the whole Sakura thing, but you can at least fulfill your obligations as a friend in the end, right?"[wsay canskip=1]::
6731::$$$message_0060_0020_0000$$$::Our conversation ends there.[lr]::
6732::$$$message_0060_0020_0001$$$::All I hear is the buzzing electronic tone from the receiver.::
6733::$$$message_0060_0021_0000$$$::"What's with him?"[lr]::
6734::$$$message_0060_0021_0001$$$::But what should I do?[lr]::
6735::$$$message_0060_0021_0002$$$::Tohsaka should be in the house, but I don't see her anywhere. And if I go to school, I can't bring Saber.[lr]::
6736::$$$message_0060_0021_0003$$$::But then, if I don't do what Shinji asks, I'm worried what he might do.::
6737::$$$message_0060_0022_0000$$$::He's probably agitated because of that merciless rejection Tohsaka gave him yesterday. If I ignore him, he might get violent with Sakura again.::
6738::$$$message_0060_0023_0000$$$::"Well, it's still bright out, so it shouldn't be an issue."[lr]::
6739::$$$message_0060_0023_0001$$$::I should hurry, now that I've made a decision.[lr]::
6740::$$$message_0060_0023_0002$$$::If I hurry, I should be able to make it by sixth period.::
6741::$$$message_0060_0024_0000$$$::There's nobody at the school gate.[lr]::
6742::$$$message_0060_0024_0001$$$::From the outside, it looks like the school is deserted, since class is in session.[lr]::
6743::$$$message_0060_0024_0002$$$::Maybe there's no physical education class either, since there's nobody in the courtyard either.::
6744::$$$message_0060_0025_0000$$$::Well, that's going to change in a few minutes.[lr]::
6745::$$$message_0060_0025_0001$$$::When sixth period's over, school's out.[lr]::
6746::$$$message_0060_0025_0002$$$::The campus and exits will be overflowing with people on their way out.::
6747::$$$message_0060_0026_0000$$$::I head up to the third floor.[lr]::
6748::$$$message_0060_0026_0001$$$::There's nobody in the hallway either.[lr]::
6749::$$$message_0060_0026_0002$$$::Everyone must be in their classrooms, so I feel a little awkward walking into class C.::
6750::$$$message_0060_0027_0000$$$::"Well, it's not like I'm going to be completely conspicuous, so I should hurry to the classroom."[lr]::
6751::$$$message_0060_0027_0001$$$::Class C is down the hall.[lr]::
6752::$$$message_0060_0027_0002$$$::Right now, I'm in front of class H, which is closest to the stairs, so there are five classrooms between me and my destination.::
6753::$$$message_0060_0028_0000$$$::"Eh...?"[lr]::
6754::$$$message_0060_0028_0001$$$::A wave of dizziness slams into me.[lr]::
6755::$$$message_0060_0028_0002$$$::My entire body is also overcome with nausea.::
6756::$$$message_0060_0028_0003$$$::"U...Ngh..."[lr]::
6757::$$$message_0060_0028_0004$$$::My stomach churns.[lr]::
6758::$$$message_0060_0028_0005$$$::My senses are going completely haywire.[lr]::
6759::$$$message_0060_0028_0006$$$::Red floods my vision...[lr]::
6760::$$$message_0060_0028_0007$$$::...as if blood were seeping into my eyes.::
6761::$$$message_0060_0028_0008$$$::"Ha...ah...gh...n...!!!"[lr]::
6762::$$$message_0060_0028_0009$$$::The temperature around me hasn't changed, but my body is suddenly unbearably hot.::
6763::$$$message_0060_0028_0010$$$::"...What the hell...is this!?"[lr]::
6764::$$$message_0060_0028_0011$$$::I stumble.[lr]::
6765::$$$message_0060_0028_0012$$$::Strength leaves my body.[lr]::
6766::$$$message_0060_0028_0013$$$::I feel like I'm withering, and I can't do anything to stop it...in the same way you can't stop sand from falling in an hourglass.::
6767::$$$message_0060_0028_0014$$$::"Kn...Ngh...!"[lr]::
6768::$$$message_0060_0028_0015$$$::I'm suffocating.[lr]::
6769::$$$message_0060_0028_0016$$$::My throat burns.[lr]::
6770::$$$message_0060_0028_0017$$$::Was all the air sucked from this hallway...from the entire school!?[lr]::
6771::$$$message_0060_0028_0018$$$::I sway and, by accident, stagger toward a window. Desperate for air, I jerk it open.::
6772::$$$message_0060_0028_0019$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
6773::$$$message_0060_0028_0020$$$::I freeze.[lr]::
6774::$$$message_0060_0028_0021$$$::This is so unbelievable I can't even find the wherewithal to get confused.::
6775::$$$message_0060_0028_0022$$$::Outside the window...[lr]::
6776::$$$message_0060_0028_0023$$$::...the entire campus is a field of endless red.[lr]::
6777::$$$message_0060_0028_0024$$$::It looks like the school was carved out of the world and plunged into a sea of red.::
6778::$$$message_0060_0028_0025$$$::The school building looks like an altar, draped in a red canopy.[lr]::
6779::$$$message_0060_0028_0026$$$::And then finally...[lr]::
6780::$$$message_0060_0028_0027$$$::I realize what's happening.::
6781::$$$message_0060_0028_0028$$$::"Ungh...!"[lr]::
6782::$$$message_0060_0028_0029$$$::I move away from the window.[lr]::
6783::$$$message_0060_0028_0030$$$::I muster up what sense I have left and force my feet to move, heading into the classroom closest to me.::
6784::$$$message_0060_0028_0031$$$::Inside...[lr]::
6785::$$$message_0060_0028_0032$$$::...not a single student is seated in any of the chairs.[lr]::
6786::$$$message_0060_0028_0033$$$::They're all lying on the floor. Even the teacher is on the floor behind the podium.::
6787::$$$message_0060_0028_0034$$$::   They're still breathing.[lr]::
6788::$$$message_0060_0028_0035$$$::Everyone is convulsing, as if pleading for help.[lr]::
6789::$$$message_0060_0028_0036$$$::Nobody is dead yet.[lr]::
6790::$$$message_0060_0028_0037$$$::The students don't have the strength to get up. They're just waiting to rot away.[lr]::
6791::$$$message_0060_0028_0038$$$::Seeing their miserable state on the floor...[lr]::
6792::$$$message_0060_0028_0039$$$::...brings to mind the burning ruins from that day.::
6793::$$$message_0060_0028_0040$$$::"Ah...gngh..."[lr]::
6794::$$$message_0060_0028_0041$$$::The nausea intensifies.[lr]::
6795::$$$message_0060_0028_0042$$$::But, I can still get a handle on the situation.[lr]::
6796::$$$message_0060_0028_0043$$$::I take a look at the students on the floor.[lr]::
6797::$$$message_0060_0028_0044$$$::It's difficult, but we [font italic=true]can[font italic=false] breathe.[lr]::
6798::$$$message_0060_0028_0045$$$::They're not dead. If I hurry and get help, there may be a chance to save them.[lr]::
6799::$$$message_0060_0028_0046$$$::But the moment I check the face of a student nearby, something clicks inside my head.::
6800::$$$message_0060_0028_0047$$$::"Their...skin..."[lr]::
6801::$$$message_0060_0028_0048$$$::It's hard as wax.[lr]::
6802::$$$message_0060_0028_0049$$$::Not everyone is like this.[lr]::
6803::$$$message_0060_0028_0050$$$::It varies from person to person, but the most severely weakened students' blood seems to have coagulated around their joints.::
6804::$$$message_0060_0028_0051$$$::Oily and glistening...[lr]::
6805::$$$message_0060_0028_0052$$$::...stiff, motionless arms, fixed, staring eyes...just like wax figures.::
6806::$$$message_0060_0028_0053$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
6807::$$$message_0060_0028_0054$$$::I know this...[lr]::
6808::$$$message_0060_0028_0055$$$::I recognize this scene.::
6809::$$$message_0060_0028_0056$$$::"...Stop."[lr]::
6810::$$$message_0060_0028_0057$$$::This is just...a hellscape...[lr]::
6811::$$$message_0060_0028_0058$$$::I know this sight well.::
6812::$$$message_0060_0028_0059$$$::"I said, stop..."[lr]::
6813::$$$message_0060_0028_0060$$$::All that's sustaining me now...[lr]::
6814::$$$message_0060_0028_0061$$$::...is anger that has completely eclipsed any fear.::
6815::$$$message_0060_0028_0062$$$::"Guh...!"[lr]::
6816::$$$message_0060_0028_0063$$$::My left arm tingles.[lr]::
6817::$$$message_0060_0028_0064$$$::The Command Spell on the back of my hand is warning me that an enemy is nearby.::
6818::$$$message_0060_0028_0065$$$::"Ha...ah...!!!"[lr]::
6819::$$$message_0060_0028_0066$$$::I run, though my breathing is heavy and labored.[lr]::
6820::$$$message_0060_0028_0067$$$::I've long since lost my mind.::
6821::$$$message_0060_0028_0068$$$::"Yo, Emiya. Glad to see you're doing better than I expected.[lr]::
6822::$$$message_0060_0028_0069$$$::So what do you think of this?"[lr]::
6823::$$$message_0060_0028_0070$$$::At the end of the hallway.[lr]::
6824::$$$message_0060_0028_0071$$$::Shinji Matou is standing in front of class C.::
6825::$$$message_0060_0029_0000$$$::My arm throbs.[lr]::
6826::$$$message_0060_0029_0001$$$::My Command Spells are screaming at me, telling me the boy just ahead caused all of this.::
6827::$$$message_0060_0030_0000$$$::"So this is all your doing, Shinji?"[lr]::
6828::$$$message_0060_0030_0001$$$::I can't breathe properly, but I glare at Shinji, who is keeping his distance.[lr]::
6829::$$$message_0060_0030_0002$$$::He must really like what he's seeing.[lr]::
6830::$$$message_0060_0030_0003$$$::Because the next thing I know, Shinji throws his arms wide and starts [font italic=true]cackling[font italic=false] in the bloodred hallway.::
6831::$$$message_0060_0031_0000$$$::"Of course it is. I knew as soon as you arrived, so I triggered the Bounded Field. It wasn't easy to time just right, you know? If I did it too early, you'd run away, and if I did it too late, we would've had to face each other.[lr]::
6832::$$$message_0060_0031_0001$$$::I wanted to see the look on your face myself, so I didn't want to make it too simple."::
6833::$$$message_0060_0032_0000$$$::"So you were lying about having something to discuss."[lr]::
6834::$$$message_0060_0032_0001$$$::"Discuss? Actually, we're just about to start that part. I need to show Tohsaka how much better I am than you. And I should apologize for lying to you as well.[lr]::
6835::$$$message_0060_0032_0002$$$::See, I didn't tell you that I was the one who put the Bounded Field up over the school."::
6836::$$$message_0060_0033_0000$$$::Shinji laughs like it's the funniest thing ever.[lr]::
6837::$$$message_0060_0033_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
6838::$$$message_0060_0033_0002$$$::That...[lr]::
6839::$$$message_0060_0033_0003$$$::I guess I've learned never to trust him.::
6840::$$$message_0060_0034_0000$$$::"Hey. You don't look as surprised as I'd have thought. So when I told you the Bounded Field wasn't mine, you didn't believe me. Ha! Oh, this is too good. So sometimes even you don't trust people!"[lr]::
6841::$$$message_0060_0034_0001$$$::Shinji's merry laughter bores into my skull like a drill.::
6842::$$$message_0060_0035_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
6843::$$$message_0060_0035_0001$$$::I have to point out, I'm plenty surprised.[lr]::
6844::$$$message_0060_0035_0002$$$::I'd just been bracing myself to learn who set up this Bounded Field: Shinji or the other Master.::
6845::$$$message_0060_0036_0000$$$::That was all.[lr]::
6846::$$$message_0060_0036_0001$$$::But so much for my optimism.[lr]::
6847::$$$message_0060_0036_0002$$$::I should have settled things with Shinji the moment I learned he was a Master.[lr]::
6848::$$$message_0060_0036_0003$$$::This is all my fault.::
6849::$$$message_0060_0037_0000$$$::"Shinji. Why did you do this? Were you lying about having no intention of fighting too?"::
6850::$$$message_0060_0038_0000$$$::"Well, I think that was the truth. I had no intention of activating this. It was really just a negotiation tool.[lr]::
6851::$$$message_0060_0038_0001$$$::If I set a bomb, Tohsaka would think twice about attacking me, and I'd have an ace up my sleeve in case something happened."::
6852::$$$message_0060_0039_0000$$$::"I see. But Tohsaka said it would take a few more days to activate the Bounded Field. Does that mean she miscalculated?"::
6853::$$$message_0060_0040_0000$$$::"Hmph. She [font italic=true]would[font italic=false] say that. But you know, the Bounded Field may not be complete, but it's already formed. Activating it is no problem.[lr]::
6854::$$$message_0060_0040_0001$$$::Okay, I admit that does make it less effective. At this point, it might take a few more minutes to kill anyone."::
6855::$$$message_0060_0041_0000$$$::"...Stop it."[lr]::
6856::$$$message_0060_0041_0001$$$::The nausea is long since gone.[lr]::
6857::$$$message_0060_0041_0002$$$::That one thing is all I can think to say to Shinji right now.::
6858::$$$message_0060_0042_0000$$$::"Stop it? Stop what? You're not telling me to stop this Bounded Field, are you? I can't waste a perfectly good Bounded Field by stopping it after it's already been activated."::
6859::$$$message_0060_0043_0000$$$::"I said, stop it. Do you have any idea what you've done!?"::
6860::$$$message_0060_0044_0000$$$::"You're pissing me off. You think you can order me around?[lr]::
6861::$$$message_0060_0044_0001$$$::Besides, this is my power. I'm the one who decides whether or not to stop it, and if you really want me to stop it, the least you can do is to get on your knees and beg. Honestly, you and Fujimura both need to learn your place."::
6862::$$$message_0060_0045_0000$$$::"Hey. What about Fuji-nee?"::
6863::$$$message_0060_0046_0000$$$::"Eh? Oh, Fujimura? She managed to squirm around even after the Bounded Field activated. Everyone was dropping like flies, but there she was, still wobbling around.[lr]::
6864::$$$message_0060_0046_0001$$$::So she hobbled over to me since I was still standing, and had the nerve to tell me to call an ambulance. Unbelievable, right? Playing the model teacher and all that."::
6865::$$$message_0060_0047_0000$$$::"Of course I'm not gonna do something like that. Don't want to. But Fujimura kept clinging to me, which really pissed me off. But when I kicked her, she stopped moving![lr]::
6866::$$$message_0060_0047_0001$$$::Hahahaha! She'll probably die first!"::
6867::$$$message_0060_0048_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
6868::$$$message_0060_0048_0001$$$::I feel a switch flipping inside me.[lr]::
6869::$$$message_0060_0048_0002$$$::Tohsaka said something about pressing a switch in my head, but it's nothing like that.[lr]::
6870::$$$message_0060_0048_0003$$$::There's this...echoing clang in my head.[lr]::
6871::$$$message_0060_0048_0004$$$::A firing hammer strikes inside my head, and the inside of my body suddenly switches over.::
6872::$$$message_0060_0049_0000$$$::"This is your last warning. Stop the Bounded Field, Shinji."[lr]::
6873::$$$message_0060_0049_0001$$$::"You really don't get it, do you? The more you try ordering me around, the less I want to listen. If you don't like what I'm doing, then you'd better try to stop me yourself, Emiya."[lr]::
6874::$$$message_0060_0049_0002$$$::"Got it. Then it's really simple."[lr]::
6875::$$$message_0060_0049_0003$$$::All I have to do...[lr]::
6876::$$$message_0060_0049_0004$$$::I need to stop him so I can stop the Bounded Field.::
6877::$$$message_0060_0050_0000$$$::Something surges inside me.[lr]::
6878::$$$message_0060_0050_0001$$$::Fiery heat blooms through my whole body.[lr]::
6879::$$$message_0060_0050_0002$$$::There's no more than twenty meters between me and Shinji.[lr]::
6880::$$$message_0060_0050_0003$$$::It should only take an instant.[lr]::
6881::$$$message_0060_0050_0004$$$::My body is surging with vitality...so much more than when I activate my Magic Circuits.::
6882::$$$message_0060_0051_0000$$$::"Ha! You really are an idiot!"[lr]::
6883::$$$message_0060_0051_0001$$$::A shadow wavers.[lr]::
6884::$$$message_0060_0051_0002$$$::The dark shape waiting in the corner of the hallway begins to take shape and move.[lr]::
6885::$$$message_0060_0051_0003$$$::A hard, sharp edge made of darkness itself...[lr]::
6886::$$$message_0060_0051_0004$$$::It's like a guillotine, ready to cleave anything that approaches Shinji in two.::
6887::$$$message_0060_0052_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
6888::$$$message_0060_0052_0001$$$::I don't know what kind of magecraft it is.[lr]::
6889::$$$message_0060_0052_0002$$$::Three shadows emerge.[lr]::
6890::$$$message_0060_0052_0003$$$::If that's all there is, I...[lr]ут`j
