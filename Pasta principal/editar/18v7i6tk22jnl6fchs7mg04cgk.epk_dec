74663::$$$message_0684_0000_0000$$$::"...All right, I'll be honest.[lr]::
74664::$$$message_0684_0000_0001$$$::But first, let me be clear about something. I don't know how to flatter or say things to make people like me, so I'd appreciate it if you keep that in mind."::
74665::$$$message_0684_0001_0000$$$::I fix Rider with a serious stare.[lr]::
74666::$$$message_0684_0001_0001$$$::She's as unreadable as ever, but she seems to understand that I'm being serious.::
74667::$$$message_0684_0002_0000$$$::"I'll just say it[line2]I don't hold a grudge against you, Rider, and I don't mind if you eat with us, either. I don't know how to approach you, Rider, but I'm rather fond of you."[lr]::
74668::$$$message_0684_0002_0001$$$::I fight down my nervousness and say it clearly.::
74669::$$$message_0684_0003_0000$$$::"...You can't mean that. Aren't you afraid of me?"::
74670::$$$message_0684_0004_0000$$$::"Sure I am. You scare me, but you're on our side.[lr]::
74671::$$$message_0684_0004_0001$$$::You've already saved me once, and you fought to protect Sakura at the school. I can't hate you for that... I'm just not sure how to approach you."::
74672::$$$message_0684_0005_0000$$$::"...I fail to understand, but you don't appear to be lying... I'll ask one more time. Aren't you afraid of me?"::
74673::$$$message_0684_0006_0000$$$::"I said I am. I've seen firsthand how fearsome of a Servant you are.[lr]::
74674::$$$message_0684_0006_0001$$$::...But, it feels like you're all right on the inside, like you're similar to Sakura, somehow. So I think I can trust you, and I hope you'll keep protecting Sakura. I'm just not sure how to deal with you, personally."::
74675::$$$message_0684_0007_0000$$$::Urgh...that sounded like a romantic confession.[lr]::
74676::$$$message_0684_0007_0001$$$::I feel like she'll ask me the same question again if I look her in the eyes, so I'd better turn away and play this[line2][lr]::
74677::$$$message_0684_0007_0002$$$::...Wait.[lr]::
74678::$$$message_0684_0007_0003$$$::Oh crap, what am I saying in front of Sakura!?::
74679::$$$message_0684_0008_0000$$$::"It's not what you think, Sakura. I was just talking about my preferences, not saying that I[line2]"[lr]::
74680::$$$message_0684_0008_0001$$$::"I don't care. Now I know that you're flirtatious and have a weak spot for beautiful women."::
74681::$$$message_0684_0009_0000$$$::"Mrgh."[lr]::
74682::$$$message_0684_0009_0001$$$::Wow.[lr]::
74683::$$$message_0684_0009_0002$$$::Is this the first time Sakura has ever looked this upset with me?::
74684::$$$message_0684_0010_0000$$$::"Hold on, calm down. I like Rider as a person, not as a woman. You trust her, right? I feel the same way.[lr]::
74685::$$$message_0684_0010_0001$$$::Besides, to me, you're actually the prettier one. Compared to Rider, I'd say[line2]"::
74686::$$$message_0684_0011_0000$$$::Whoa, w-what was that incredible hostility I just felt from Rider!?::
74687::$$$message_0684_0012_0000$$$::"...Um, that you're in no way any less beautiful, and I don't think it's right to compare people to each other."[lr]::
74688::$$$message_0684_0012_0001$$$::...Uh oh.[lr]::
74689::$$$message_0684_0012_0002$$$::The more I run my mouth, the deeper I seem to dig my grave.::
74690::$$$message_0684_0013_0000$$$::"...Actually, never mind. This isn't something to talk about over breakfast. I suggest we change the topic."[lr]::
74691::$$$message_0684_0013_0001$$$::I raise my hands pleadingly.[lr]::
74692::$$$message_0684_0013_0002$$$::Depending on how you see it, it could be a complete surrender.::
74693::$$$message_0684_0014_0000$$$::"No, we're not finished yet. This is a good chance to find out how you really feel, Senpai."[lr]::
74694::$$$message_0684_0014_0001$$$::"I agree with Sakura. It's a trivial matter to me, but we ought to clarify this."[lr]::
74695::$$$message_0684_0014_0002$$$::Both of them lean in toward me.::
74696::$$$message_0684_0015_0000$$$::"Senpai. Do you like me or Rider more?[lr]::
74697::$$$message_0684_0015_0001$$$::I'm sure you know what your own feelings are."[lr]::
74698::$$$message_0684_0015_0002$$$::Ah.::
74699::$$$message_0684_0016_0000$$$::"Sakura is right. It's a trivial matter, but I'm interested in your answer as well."[lr]::
74700::$$$message_0684_0016_0001$$$::Oof.::
74701::$$$message_0684_0017_0000$$$::"Let's hear your answer!"[lr]::
74702::$$$message_0684_0017_0001$$$::I feel my back against the wall.[lr]::
74703::$$$message_0684_0017_0002$$$::I have no way out, and I know that the moment I open my mouth, I'm bound to piss one of them off.::
74704::$$$message_0684_0018_0000$$$::"Urgh..."[lr]::
74705::$$$message_0684_0018_0001$$$::But the trouble won't end there.[lr]::
74706::$$$message_0684_0018_0002$$$::Once the truth comes out, it'll hound me for a while to come.[lr]::
74707::$$$message_0684_0018_0003$$$::...Sakura and Rider.[lr]::
74708::$$$message_0684_0018_0004$$$::Maybe it's just their solidarity as fellow women, but these two are really alike.:µ“Ï
