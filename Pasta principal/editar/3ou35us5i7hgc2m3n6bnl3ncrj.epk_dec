30914::$$$message_0245_0000_0000$$$::Bet the odds are greater than fifty-fifty that she's after me.[lr]::
30915::$$$message_0245_0000_0001$$$::What bothers me is how she's acting.[lr]::
30916::$$$message_0245_0000_0002$$$::You'd think, based on her personality, that she'd just drag me right out if she had business with me. But waiting around more like a regular, everyday girl?::
30917::$$$message_0245_0001_0000$$$::"...I want to ignore her, but I don't think it wise... I'm scared of what'll happen if I ignore her."[lr]::
30918::$$$message_0245_0001_0001$$$::I get up from my seat holding my lunch.[lr]::
30919::$$$message_0245_0001_0002$$$::Bracing myself for the interrogation that's sure to come from Gotou and the others later, I make for the hallway.::
30920::$$$message_0245_0002_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. What are you doing here?"[lr]::
30921::$$$message_0245_0002_0001$$$::"O-obviously I'm taking a walk! It's natural to go eat lunch during lunch break, right?"::
30922::$$$message_0245_0003_0000$$$::...Tohsaka is acting too suspiciously.[lr]::
30923::$$$message_0245_0003_0001$$$::She's restless and doesn't try to make eye contact with me.::
30924::$$$message_0245_0004_0000$$$::"Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Then go find a good spot.[lr]::
30925::$$$message_0245_0004_0001$$$::I'll be at the student council room."[lr]::
30926::$$$message_0245_0004_0002$$$::I raise my lunch to say goodbye and turn that way.::
30927::$$$message_0245_0005_0000$$$::"H-hey, hold on! You're doing this on purpose, right!?"[lr]::
30928::$$$message_0245_0005_0001$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
30929::$$$message_0245_0005_0002$$$::I turn back around.::
30930::$$$message_0245_0006_0000$$$::"Look, Tohsaka. I don't know what happened, but I can't read minds. If you have something to say, out with it."[lr]::
30931::$$$message_0245_0006_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
30932::$$$message_0245_0006_0002$$$::Tohsaka just stares at me, still unable to explain.[lr]::
30933::$$$message_0245_0006_0003$$$::...Hmm.[lr]::
30934::$$$message_0245_0006_0004$$$::Could this be...?::
30935::$$$message_0245_0007_0000$$$::"Did you forget your lunch money? I won't give you my lunch, but I can lend you some money if you wanna get a sandwich."[lr]::
30936::$$$message_0245_0007_0001$$$::"...Ugh, of course not, you jackass!!!"::
30937::$$$message_0245_0008_0000$$$::Tohsaka basically screams.[lr]::
30938::$$$message_0245_0008_0001$$$::The hallway goes quiet at once.[lr]::
30939::$$$message_0245_0008_0002$$$::After a few seconds, everything resumes as if nothing happened.::
30940::$$$message_0245_0009_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
30941::$$$message_0245_0009_0001$$$::...I see, I see. They rejected reality to substitute their own.[lr]::
30942::$$$message_0245_0009_0002$$$::Theres no way that Rin Tohsaka[line2]the beautiful idol of the second years and model student moreover[line2]would raise her voice in the hallway, let alone say something like "jackass."[lr]::
30943::$$$message_0245_0009_0003$$$::So what just happened has been ignored and entirely erased from memory.::
30944::$$$message_0245_0010_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
30945::$$$message_0245_0010_0001$$$::...Lucky.[lr]::
30946::$$$message_0245_0010_0002$$$::I wish I could do the same for the past four days or so.::
30947::$$$message_0245_0011_0000$$$::"...So. If it's not lunch money, then what is it?"[lr]::
30948::$$$message_0245_0011_0001$$$::"Uh... Y-you're having lunch, right? Then do you want to come with me? I know a much better place than the student council room."::
30949::$$$message_0245_0012_0000$$$::Tohsaka says in a roundabout way, while peering at me from time to time.[lr]::
30950::$$$message_0245_0012_0001$$$::...Oh.[lr]::
30951::$$$message_0245_0012_0002$$$::Basically, she just wants to talk to me to have a strategy meeting...::
30952::$$$message_0245_0013_0000$$$::   Wait.[lr]::
30953::$$$message_0245_0013_0001$$$::Is this really the [font italic=true]much better place[font italic=false], Tohsaka?::
