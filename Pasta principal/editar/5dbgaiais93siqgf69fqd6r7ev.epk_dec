47131::$$$message_0415_0000_0000$$$::He easily tracks his target down.[lr]::
47132::$$$message_0415_0000_0001$$$::Lancer may seem as if he specializes in combat, but he is actually quite skilled at magecraft.[lr]::
47133::$$$message_0415_0000_0002$$$::He learned to master more than just Gáe Bolg in that arcane fortress called the Land of Shadows.[lr]::
47134::$$$message_0415_0000_0003$$$::He is a hero because he learned the eighteen Primordial Runes.[lr]::
47135::$$$message_0415_0000_0004$$$::Of course, he rarely flaunts his magical skills because he prefers to fight with a spear rather than magecraft.[lr]::
47136::$$$message_0415_0000_0005$$$::Today is one of those rare occasions.::
47137::$$$message_0415_0001_0000$$$::"...Got them."[lr]::
47138::$$$message_0415_0001_0001$$$::He drops something which had been running on the ground.[lr]::
47139::$$$message_0415_0001_0002$$$::A rock inscribed with the Berkano rune returns to being a mundane pebble, its task complete.::
47140::$$$message_0415_0002_0000$$$::"W-who the hell are you!?"[lr]::
47141::$$$message_0415_0002_0001$$$::A boy he hasn't seen before stands up in a panic.[lr]::
47142::$$$message_0415_0002_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
47143::$$$message_0415_0002_0003$$$::The shrill voice sounds familiar. Lancer retracts that thought and realizes who this is.::
47144::$$$message_0415_0003_0000$$$::"Aren't you Rider's Master? Huh, I thought you kicked the bucket a while ago."[lr]::
47145::$$$message_0415_0003_0001$$$::He breaks off.[lr]::
47146::$$$message_0415_0003_0002$$$::Rin Tohsaka is behind the boy.[lr]::
47147::$$$message_0415_0003_0003$$$::She's tied to a chair.[lr]::
47148::$$$message_0415_0003_0004$$$::That's fine.[lr]::
47149::$$$message_0415_0003_0005$$$::She's being held captive, so that makes sense.[lr]::
47150::$$$message_0415_0003_0006$$$::But several details stand out.::
47151::$$$message_0415_0004_0000$$$::First, her chair is tipped over.[lr]::
47152::$$$message_0415_0004_0001$$$::Since Rin Tohsaka is tied to the chair, she's on the ground, too.[lr]::
47153::$$$message_0415_0004_0002$$$::There's sand in her long, black hair, and something red around her mouth.[lr]::
47154::$$$message_0415_0004_0003$$$::She probably cut her lip.[lr]::
47155::$$$message_0415_0004_0004$$$::It's slight, but one can make out bruising around her lips.::
47156::$$$message_0415_0005_0000$$$::"Are you Lancer!? Who sent you here!? This wasn't the deal[line2]gyaargh!?"[lr]::
47157::$$$message_0415_0005_0001$$$::A casual fist plants itself in Shinji Matou's cheek.[lr]::
47158::$$$message_0415_0005_0002$$$::Lancer's trivial backhand sends the boy crashing into a wall.::
47159::$$$message_0415_0006_0000$$$::"Oh. Sorry about that, kid. My hand moved before my mouth did."[lr]::
47160::$$$message_0415_0006_0001$$$::He looks unconscious, but not dead.[lr]::
47161::$$$message_0415_0006_0002$$$::Granted, if Rin Tohsaka's face had been a little paler and her clothes more disheveled, it wouldn't have ended with just a knockout. He would have paid a heavy price.[lr]::
47162::$$$message_0415_0006_0003$$$::To be clear, Lancer doesn't care about the treatment of prisoners.[lr]::
47163::$$$message_0415_0006_0004$$$::But he doesn't like it when someone else steals his prey.[lr]::
47164::$$$message_0415_0006_0005$$$::Of course, enemies he kills and women he's fond of both count as his "prey."::
47165::$$$message_0415_0007_0000$$$::"Lancer...?"[lr]::
47166::$$$message_0415_0007_0001$$$::Rin Tohsaka wonders aloud from her bound position.[lr]::
47167::$$$message_0415_0007_0002$$$::Her voice sounds sleepy, as if she was unconscious.[lr]::
47168::$$$message_0415_0007_0003$$$::"Hey. It's morning, sleepyhead."[lr]::
47169::$$$message_0415_0007_0004$$$::Lancer approaches her with an out-of-place greeting.::
47170::$$$message_0415_0008_0000$$$::"Huh? W-wait, this is the Einzberns' castle."[lr]::
47171::$$$message_0415_0008_0001$$$::"I know. Just stay still. I'm going to cut your bindings. You can do as you please after that. It's up to you whether you want to go stop those idiots brawling in the hall, or leave out the back door."[lr]::
47172::$$$message_0415_0008_0002$$$::His crimson spear materializes in a whirl of air.::
47173::$$$message_0415_0009_0000$$$::"O-oh, thanks[line2]Lancer, behind you!"[lr]::
47174::$$$message_0415_0009_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
47175::$$$message_0415_0009_0002$$$::Rin's warning makes him turn.[lr]::
47176::$$$message_0415_0009_0003$$$::"Wh...at?"[lr]::
47177::$$$message_0415_0009_0004$$$::Someone even he didn't expect stands there,::
47178::$$$message_0415_0010_0000$$$::in the corner of the room.[lr]::
47179::$$$message_0415_0010_0001$$$::With firm footsteps, a man walks past where Shinji Matou pancaked into the wall.[lr]::
47180::$$$message_0415_0010_0002$$$::"That's enough, Lancer. I told you to cooperate with them, but not to involve yourself this deeply."[lr]::
47181::$$$message_0415_0010_0003$$$::Kirei Kotomine, who they thought Caster killed.::
47182::$$$message_0415_0011_0000$$$::"Kirei!?"[lr]::
47183::$$$message_0415_0011_0001$$$::Rin yelps in surprise.[lr]::
47184::$$$message_0415_0011_0002$$$::Lancer glares suspiciously at the priest.::
47185::$$$message_0415_0012_0000$$$::"...Oi. When did you convert to a new religion?[lr]::
47186::$$$message_0415_0012_0001$$$::I thought my Master didn't believe in coming to the front lines."[lr]::
47187::$$$message_0415_0012_0002$$$::"I have no faith to convert from. You are the one who has disobeyed orders, Lancer. I thought I ordered you to eliminate Archer. Did you fail?"::
47188::$$$message_0415_0013_0000$$$::"Hmph. He'll kill himself whether I lift a finger or not. I came here to wrap up some unfinished business. I was going to ask why you're here, but I assume you put that kid up to this."[lr]::
47189::$$$message_0415_0013_0001$$$::"I don't appreciate such insinuations. We are collaborators. Mutual allies working together to obtain the Holy Grail."[lr]::
47190::$$$message_0415_0013_0002$$$::Shinji Matou groans underneath the rubble. The priest doesn't even spare him a glance.::
47191::$$$message_0415_0014_0000$$$::"Okay. I figured you wouldn't die that easily. Not only are you as persistent as a cockroach, you've been pulling strings behind the scenes.[lr]::
47192::$$$message_0415_0014_0001$$$::...Talk about awful taste. Why are you manipulating someone as harmless as Shinji?"::
47193::$$$message_0415_0015_0000$$$::"Hm. He's harmless to you, is he? How very like you to say that, Rin. I would have no criticisms of you at all if you were only a slightly less capable apprentice."[lr]::
47194::$$$message_0415_0015_0001$$$::The priest chuckles.[lr]::
47195::$$$message_0415_0015_0002$$$::His expression is that of a priest blessing someone on their deathbed.::
47196::$$$message_0415_0016_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
47197::$$$message_0415_0016_0001$$$::A chill runs down Rin's back.[lr]::
47198::$$$message_0415_0016_0002$$$::She realizes what her fate is.[lr]::
47199::$$$message_0415_0016_0003$$$::The priest looks down at his apprentice of ten years with a saintly smile.::
47200::$$$message_0415_0017_0000$$$::"...Hold on, Kotomine. What are you going to do with the woman? Did you lie when you said you wanted to help your student?"[lr]::
47201::$$$message_0415_0017_0001$$$::Lancer stands between his Master and the girl, glaring.[lr]::
47202::$$$message_0415_0017_0002$$$::"Of course not. She is an important pawn whom I've worked hard to nurture. I can hardly retire her now after deceiving her for the last decade.[lr]::
47203::$$$message_0415_0017_0003$$$::That's why I assigned you to protect her. It's only extended her life by two days, but wouldn't you say that's more than enough parental affection?"::
47204::$$$message_0415_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
47205::$$$message_0415_0018_0001$$$::The priest walks past Lancer to look at the girl sprawled on the floor.[lr]::
47206::$$$message_0415_0018_0002$$$::Rin glares up at her former mentor.::
47207::$$$message_0415_0019_0000$$$::"You phony priest. I knew you were capable of anything, but you've actually been a Master this whole time. 'Breaking the rules' doesn't even begin to describe a referee playing the game himself."[lr]::
47208::$$$message_0415_0019_0001$$$::"And yet you are taking this very calmly, Rin. You must have figured it out."::
47209::$$$message_0415_0020_0000$$$::"Of course I did. The reason I never showed you my Servant was because I suspected you... But I didn't think you'd tricked me from the very start."[lr]::
47210::$$$message_0415_0020_0001$$$::"The very start?"[lr]::
47211::$$$message_0415_0020_0002$$$::The priest frowns.[lr]::
47212::$$$message_0415_0020_0003$$$::It seems that he wasn't expecting her to say that.::
47213::$$$message_0415_0021_0000$$$::"...What? You got a problem with that, Kirei?"[lr]::
47214::$$$message_0415_0021_0001$$$::"...No. I'm just wondering when exactly you mean by 'the beginning.'"[lr]::
47215::$$$message_0415_0021_0002$$$::His lips twist into a sneer.[lr]::
47216::$$$message_0415_0021_0003$$$::The priest gazes down with a look of true elation.::
47217::$$$message_0415_0022_0000$$$::"Wait. Kirei, you..."[lr]::
47218::$$$message_0415_0022_0001$$$::"Do you mean from the beginning of this Holy Grail War?[lr]::
47219::$$$message_0415_0022_0002$$$::Or are you speaking of the previous war?"[lr]::
47220::$$$message_0415_0022_0003$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
47221::$$$message_0415_0022_0004$$$::Then, everything falls into place.[lr]::
47222::$$$message_0415_0022_0005$$$::Rin's face goes pale, and she stares up at the man who mentored her for ten years, with an incredulous look.::
47223::$$$message_0415_0023_0000$$$::"...So you killed him."[lr]::
47224::$$$message_0415_0023_0001$$$::"Naturally. He was my master whom I owed a great deal. I spared no effort in betraying him."[lr]::
47225::$$$message_0415_0023_0002$$$::"..."[lr]::
47226::$$$message_0415_0023_0003$$$::There's a grinding noise.[lr]::
47227::$$$message_0415_0023_0004$$$::The girl is staring at the ground, gritting her teeth in anguish.::
47228::$$$message_0415_0024_0000$$$::"F...FUCK OFF AND DIE, YOU DAMN PRIEST!!! EVEN HELL IS TOO GOOD FOR YOU! I HOPE EVERYONE ELSE BEATS THE SHIT OUT OF YOU FOREVER IN LIMBO![lr]::
47229::$$$message_0415_0024_0001$$$::A PIECE OF SHIT LIKE YOU DESERVES TO GET TURNED INTO A PINCUSHION JUST OUTSIDE OF HEAVEN, WHERE YOU DEFINITELY DON'T BELONG!!!"[lr]::
47230::$$$message_0415_0024_0002$$$::In a rage, she hurls abuse after abuse at him.::
47231::$$$message_0415_0025_0000$$$::Of course, the priest is unbothered by such trifles.[lr]::
47232::$$$message_0415_0025_0001$$$::Someone else is taken aback by the girl's sudden fit, however.[lr]::
47233::$$$message_0415_0025_0002$$$::Shinji has never imagined that Rin could bare such emotion, even in his dreams.::
47234::$$$message_0415_0026_0000$$$::"Kotomine. I said I'd take Tohsaka, remember? I'm the only one who still has business with her. You just need to wait at the church for me to wrap things up."[lr]::
47235::$$$message_0415_0026_0001$$$::"No, I still need her, too. I will have her become the Holy Grail."[lr]::
47236::$$$message_0415_0026_0002$$$::Shinji doesn't understand what the priest is saying.[lr]::
47237::$$$message_0415_0026_0003$$$::Only the priest and the girl he intends to sacrifice do.::
47238::$$$message_0415_0027_0000$$$::"This would be an opportune time to eliminate Archer and Saber.[lr]::
47239::$$$message_0415_0027_0001$$$::If they offer any unnecessary resistance, it will affect her freshness. We should settle this quickly."[lr]::
47240::$$$message_0415_0027_0002$$$::The priest steps away from the girl.[lr]::
47241::$$$message_0415_0027_0003$$$::Only Lancer is in front of Rin now, armed with his spear.::
47242::$$$message_0415_0028_0000$$$::"Kotomine, you little..."[lr]::
47243::$$$message_0415_0028_0001$$$::"Dispose of this garbage, Lancer. The vessel does not need a heart."[lr]::
47244::$$$message_0415_0028_0002$$$::Only Shinji reacts to those words.::
47245::$$$message_0415_0029_0000$$$::Rin just glares at the priest, gnashing her teeth.[lr]::
47246::$$$message_0415_0029_0001$$$::The priest's smile already told her that she is going to die here.[lr]::
47247::$$$message_0415_0029_0002$$$::She knows that no help is coming, and that no one would hear her even if she begged for help.[lr]::
47248::$$$message_0415_0029_0003$$$::So she absolutely refuses to snivel.[lr]::
47249::$$$message_0415_0029_0004$$$::It's the only form of resistance she can offer, and it represents her defiance.::
47250::$$$message_0415_0030_0000$$$::She won't give up until the very end.[lr]::
47251::$$$message_0415_0030_0001$$$::Help might still come at the last possible second, or a miracle might even occur, like something that destroys the entire room, leaving only her intact.[lr]::
47252::$$$message_0415_0030_0002$$$::[font italic=true]"...I know it's impossible, though."[font italic=false][r][wsay canskip=1]::
47253::$$$message_0415_0030_0003$$$::She won't give up, but she knows what is and isn't possible.::
47254::$$$message_0415_0031_0000$$$::That's why she isn't very scared.[lr]::
47255::$$$message_0415_0031_0001$$$::There's just one thing she's worried about.[lr]::
47256::$$$message_0415_0031_0002$$$::It's awkward to imagine what face he'll make when he comes to save her after she's dead.[lr]::
47257::$$$message_0415_0031_0003$$$::She doesn't want to make him cry.[lr]::
47258::$$$message_0415_0031_0004$$$::It pisses her off thinking that she'll make him cry, and she doesn't know how to apologize for it.::
47259::$$$message_0415_0032_0000$$$::Of course, she can't apologize if she's dead, but she still doesn't want him to cry.[lr]::
47260::$$$message_0415_0032_0001$$$::[font italic=true]"...Sorry, Emiya. Guess I'm tapping out first."[font italic=false][r][wsay canskip=1]::
47261::$$$message_0415_0032_0002$$$::So she apologizes now, while she still can.[lr]::
47262::$$$message_0415_0032_0003$$$::It doesn't matter, but it at least makes her feel more at ease.::
47263::$$$message_0415_0033_0000$$$::"What's wrong, Lancer? Your opponent is a young girl. It should be easy enough to stab her."[lr]::
47264::$$$message_0415_0033_0001$$$::The priest has no mercy.[lr]::
47265::$$$message_0415_0033_0002$$$::However...[lr]::
47266::$$$message_0415_0033_0003$$$::"Forget it. I'm not playing along this time. If you want me to do that, use a Command Spell."[lr]::
47267::$$$message_0415_0033_0004$$$::Lancer answers Rin's enemy with defiance.::
47268::$$$message_0415_0034_0000$$$::"What?"[lr]::
47269::$$$message_0415_0034_0001$$$::The priest narrows his eyes.[lr]::
47270::$$$message_0415_0034_0002$$$::Master and Servant glare daggers at each other,[lr]::
47271::$$$message_0415_0034_0003$$$::and the temperature in the room seems to drop.::
47272::$$$message_0415_0035_0000$$$::"...I see. You leave me no choice. I hate to waste a Command Spell on a task I can do myself, but..."[lr]::
47273::$$$message_0415_0035_0001$$$::The priest lifts his left arm.[lr]::
47274::$$$message_0415_0035_0002$$$::He activates the Command Spells inscribed on it.::
47275::$$$message_0415_0036_0000$$$::                                   "Then, I order you to [font italic=true]kill yourself[font italic=false], Lancer."::
47276::$$$message_0415_0037_0000$$$::"Gugh..."[lr]::
47277::$$$message_0415_0037_0001$$$::Lancer coughs blood.[lr]::
47278::$$$message_0415_0037_0002$$$::But the red droplets that dribble from his mouth pale in comparison to the torrent of blood gushing from his chest.::
47279::$$$message_0415_0038_0000$$$::"Damn you, Kotomine..."[lr]::
47280::$$$message_0415_0038_0001$$$::His murmur can't even be heard.[lr]::
47281::$$$message_0415_0038_0002$$$::Lancer has stabbed himself through the chest with his own spear, completely destroying his heart.::
47282::$$$message_0415_0039_0000$$$::"Goodbye. Your role in this is over."[lr]::
47283::$$$message_0415_0039_0001$$$::"Nrgh[line4], [line12]"[lr]::
47284::$$$message_0415_0039_0002$$$::The azure-armored spearman collapses to the floor.[lr]::
47285::$$$message_0415_0039_0003$$$::"Ah....ah...."[lr]::
47286::$$$message_0415_0039_0004$$$::Pooling scarlet seeps into the floor.[lr]::
47287::$$$message_0415_0039_0005$$$::...Lancer shows no sign of getting up.[lr]::
47288::$$$message_0415_0039_0006$$$::He has fallen by his own spear, on his Master's orders.::
47289::$$$message_0415_0040_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
47290::$$$message_0415_0040_0001$$$::The priest moves.[lr]::
47291::$$$message_0415_0040_0002$$$::He approaches Rin with easygoing steps, and takes a knee next to her.[lr]::
47292::$$$message_0415_0040_0003$$$::He reaches out with a hand to the bound girl's chest, as if[lr]::
47293::$$$message_0415_0040_0004$$$::to pluck her heart out.::
47294::$$$message_0415_0041_0000$$$::"Hey! That wasn't the deal, Kotomine! You said [font italic=true]I[font italic=false] could have Tohsaka!"[lr]::
47295::$$$message_0415_0041_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
47296::$$$message_0415_0041_0002$$$::The priest glances at Shinji without answering.::
47297::$$$message_0415_0042_0000$$$::"Y-you can't! You can't kill Tohsaka! I still owe her a lot! I need her alive!"[lr]::
47298::$$$message_0415_0042_0001$$$::Shinji whines, his back to Lancer's corpse.::
47299::$$$message_0415_0043_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
47300::$$$message_0415_0043_0001$$$::"Ah...urgh..."[lr]::
47301::$$$message_0415_0043_0002$$$::But his protests die off.[lr]::
47302::$$$message_0415_0043_0003$$$::The boy cowers away from the priest's severe gaze.[lr]::
47303::$$$message_0415_0043_0004$$$::The priest looks back down at the girl.::
47304::$$$message_0415_0044_0000$$$::"Any last words? I'll hear them out."[lr]::
47305::$$$message_0415_0044_0001$$$::A simple concession.[lr]::
47306::$$$message_0415_0044_0002$$$::"...Hmph. You know what I'm thinking already."[lr]::
47307::$$$message_0415_0044_0003$$$::Rin answers him in her usual tone.::
47308::$$$message_0415_0045_0000$$$::"I suppose I do. You won't give up until the end, Rin.[lr]::
47309::$$$message_0415_0045_0001$$$::At the same time, your ability to instantly accept hard truths is one of your greatest strengths.[lr]::
47310::$$$message_0415_0045_0002$$$::...Very good. That contradiction is quite delectable."::
47311::$$$message_0415_0046_0000$$$::He doesn't hesitate.[lr]::
47312::$$$message_0415_0046_0001$$$::The priest roughly shoves his hand into the girl's chest, over where her heart would be.[lr]::
47313::$$$message_0415_0046_0002$$$::"Ngh..."[lr]::
47314::$$$message_0415_0046_0003$$$::She closes her eyes.::
47315::$$$message_0415_0047_0000$$$::There's a stabbing sound.[lr]::
47316::$$$message_0415_0047_0001$$$::A heart is pierced, and blood spills out.[lr]::
47317::$$$message_0415_0047_0002$$$::The stone room becomes a tomb for yet another dead body.::
47318::$$$message_0415_0048_0000$$$::"...Ngh!"[lr]::
47319::$$$message_0415_0048_0001$$$::Rin is the one who gasps.[lr]::
47320::$$$message_0415_0048_0002$$$::The floor is drenched in blood.[lr]::
47321::$$$message_0415_0048_0003$$$::The dripping comes from somewhere high up.[lr]::
47322::$$$message_0415_0048_0004$$$::From the floor, Rin looks up to see that it's coming from the priest's chest.::
47323::$$$message_0415_0049_0000$$$::"...Gurgh."[lr]::
47324::$$$message_0415_0049_0001$$$::Blood rises from his esophagus.[lr]::
47325::$$$message_0415_0049_0002$$$::The hole in his chest is obviously a fatal wound.[lr]::
47326::$$$message_0415_0049_0003$$$::And the thing that stabbed him from behind is none other than a cursed spear known especially for piercing.::
47327::$$$message_0415_0050_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
47328::$$$message_0415_0050_0001$$$::The priest feels no emotion.[lr]::
47329::$$$message_0415_0050_0002$$$::He simply looks at Lancer behind him, blood running from his mouth.::
47330::$$$message_0415_0051_0000$$$::"Lancer, you..."[lr]::
47331::$$$message_0415_0051_0001$$$::"Too bad for you, Kotomine. I wouldn't be a hero if this much was enough to kill me."[lr]::
47332::$$$message_0415_0051_0002$$$::Lancer's sardonic tone clearly sounds like a bluff.[lr]::
47333::$$$message_0415_0051_0003$$$::There isn't a hint of vitality in it.[lr]::
47334::$$$message_0415_0051_0004$$$::Without a heart, his body is already starting to fade.::
47335::$$$message_0415_0052_0000$$$::He pulls his spear out of Kotomine,[lr]::
47336::$$$message_0415_0052_0001$$$::who collapses lifelessly to the ground.[lr]::
47337::$$$message_0415_0052_0002$$$::Trained in the arcane and blessed by the divine he might have been, but he was still only human.[lr]::
47338::$$$message_0415_0052_0003$$$::There was no surviving a thrust to the heart from Lancer's cursed spear.::
47339::$$$message_0415_0053_0000$$$::"Ha... So that's how this ends, you fool."[lr]::
47340::$$$message_0415_0053_0001$$$::Lancer leans his crumbling body against a wall.[lr]::
47341::$$$message_0415_0053_0002$$$::But it buys him little time.[lr]::
47342::$$$message_0415_0053_0003$$$::After collapsing once, he's bound to disappear for good.[lr]::
47343::$$$message_0415_0053_0004$$$::He's lost his heart and his Master.[lr]::
47344::$$$message_0415_0053_0005$$$::The only reason his body is somehow still holding together is because of his legendary tenacity.::
47345::$$$message_0415_0054_0000$$$::"Ha... Haha, ahahahahaha! Nice! Yeah, you dumbasses, go ahead and kill each other!"[lr]::
47346::$$$message_0415_0054_0001$$$::"Huh? Shinji?"[lr]::
47347::$$$message_0415_0054_0002$$$::Shinji's cackling brings Rin back to her senses after watching the priest die.::
47348::$$$message_0415_0055_0000$$$::"What was all that about taking the Holy Grail? You were fucking useless until the very end, Father."[lr]::
47349::$$$message_0415_0055_0001$$$::Shinji kicks the priest's body.[lr]::
47350::$$$message_0415_0055_0002$$$::It doesn't move at all.[lr]::
47351::$$$message_0415_0055_0003$$$::Pleased with himself, the boy kicks the priest's face as hard as he can,[lr]::
47352::$$$message_0415_0055_0004$$$::making a dry crunching noise.[lr]::
47353::$$$message_0415_0055_0005$$$::The sound and sensation delight Shinji more than he expected.::
47354::$$$message_0415_0056_0000$$$::"Don't complain, now. I won't hold what you said earlier against you, since it would be pretty lame to talk shit about a dead man."[lr]::
47355::$$$message_0415_0056_0001$$$::Shinji snickers.[lr]::
47356::$$$message_0415_0056_0002$$$::Having lost all reservations, he closes in on Rin eagerly.::
47357::$$$message_0415_0057_0000$$$::"Sorry to keep you waiting, Tohsaka. Everyone keeps getting in the way, but we're finally alone now. There's still three more Servants. I'm sure it'll all be over by the time you're tired of crying."::
47358::$$$message_0415_0058_0000$$$::Shinji scrambles forward on all fours like a lizard, looming over Rin.[lr]::
47359::$$$message_0415_0058_0001$$$::"But I'm glad you're still here. I'm not finished with you yet. You're such a pain, Tohsaka. If you go dying on me, won't that be really unfair to me for being this patient?"::
47360::$$$message_0415_0059_0000$$$::"Come on, make some puppy eyes at me. I might help you out depending on your attitude.[lr]::
47361::$$$message_0415_0059_0001$$$::Besides, the Holy Grail is as good as mine. I'll share it with you if you become mine[line2]"[lr]::
47362::$$$message_0415_0059_0002$$$::"Unbelievable. You really are a moron."[lr]::
47363::$$$message_0415_0059_0003$$$::Tied up and on the ground,[lr]::
47364::$$$message_0415_0059_0004$$$::Rin scoffs like she's talking to a child.::
47365::$$$message_0415_0060_0000$$$::"What did you just say?"[lr]::
47366::$$$message_0415_0060_0001$$$::"I'm shocked that you still haven't learned your lesson, Shinji. Kirei was just manipulating you.[lr]::
47367::$$$message_0415_0060_0002$$$::...Listen to me. You can't handle that Servant.[lr]::
47368::$$$message_0415_0060_0003$$$::Even you should be able to tell because you're close to him. So open your eyes already and quit this deathmatch.[lr]::
47369::$$$message_0415_0060_0004$$$::It still isn't too late for you. If you don't want to die, then get out of here as soon as you can."::
47370::$$$message_0415_0061_0000$$$::"Ha! So you're just gonna beg for your life, is that it!? You're so dumb, Tohsaka. That jackass Kotomine is dead. Who's going to stop me now?"[lr]::
47371::$$$message_0415_0061_0001$$$::Shinji reaches for Rin's body.[lr]::
47372::$$$message_0415_0061_0002$$$::But the second he does...[lr]::
47373::$$$message_0415_0061_0003$$$::"Oi."[lr]::
47374::$$$message_0415_0061_0004$$$::He goes flying for a second time.::
47375::$$$message_0415_0062_0000$$$::"Geeehhhh!"[lr]::
47376::$$$message_0415_0062_0001$$$::Shinji slams into the wall again.[lr]::
47377::$$$message_0415_0062_0002$$$::"Little punk. That isn't a woman the likes of you can touch."[lr]::
47378::$$$message_0415_0062_0003$$$::Lancer glances at Shinji, and lazily walks over to Rin.::
47379::$$$message_0415_0063_0000$$$::"What, you're still gonna mouth off at me when you're a dead man walking?"[lr]::
47380::$$$message_0415_0063_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
47381::$$$message_0415_0063_0002$$$::The spearman stops.[lr]::
47382::$$$message_0415_0063_0003$$$::He turns and faces Shinji.::
47383::$$$message_0415_0064_0000$$$::"Eep! H-hmph! You could've died peacefully if you'd just taken a dirt nap. Now I'll make it hurt for what you just did.[lr]::
47384::$$$message_0415_0064_0001$$$::Come on, Gilgamesh, you're up! This guy wants to die like a badass!"::
47385::$$$message_0415_0065_0000$$$::Shinji raises his voice.[lr]::
47386::$$$message_0415_0065_0001$$$::He calls for his Servant, the mightiest slayer of heroes...::
47387::$$$message_0415_0066_0000$$$::"...Hey. What do you think you're doing!?[lr]::
47388::$$$message_0415_0066_0001$$$::Are you listening!? I said get out here!"[lr]::
47389::$$$message_0415_0066_0002$$$::His voice rings out.[lr]::
47390::$$$message_0415_0066_0003$$$::The golden Servant does not appear.[lr]::
47391::$$$message_0415_0066_0004$$$::The bloody, blue spearman takes a step towards Shinji.::
47392::$$$message_0415_0067_0000$$$::"Eeek! Sh-shit, shit, shit, shit! What the fuck!? You're supposed to be dead! Stop trying to look cool! Just die! Don't you know how lame you look, you mons[line2]"[lr]::
47393::$$$message_0415_0067_0001$$$::A strike whips out.[lr]::
47394::$$$message_0415_0067_0002$$$::"Ah..."::
47395::$$$message_0415_0068_0000$$$::A single, precise strike, like a flash of light, stabs Shinji in the right shoulder.[lr]::
47396::$$$message_0415_0068_0001$$$::"Eep?[lr]::
47397::$$$message_0415_0068_0002$$$::H-hyaaaaaaaah!?!?!?"[lr]::
47398::$$$message_0415_0068_0003$$$::His scream fills the room.[lr]::
47399::$$$message_0415_0068_0004$$$::Lancer withdraws his spear, looking bored. He puts his face in front of Shinji's.::
47400::$$$message_0415_0069_0000$$$::"Get lost. I might be on the verge of death, but I could kill a thousand more like you, easy."[lr]::
47401::$$$message_0415_0069_0001$$$::"Eek! Hah, haah, haah, eeek!"[lr]::
47402::$$$message_0415_0069_0002$$$::Hugging the wall and cowering away from the spear pointed at him, Shinji leaves the room in a mad scramble.::
47403::$$$message_0415_0070_0000$$$::"...Ugh. Waste of energy."[lr]::
47404::$$$message_0415_0070_0001$$$::With a heavy sigh, Lancer walks back over to Rin.[lr]::
47405::$$$message_0415_0070_0002$$$::The wind-cutting spear severs her bindings like tissue paper.::
47406::$$$message_0415_0071_0000$$$::"Thanks a lot, Lancer."[lr]::
47407::$$$message_0415_0071_0001$$$::Rin thanks him for her freedom.[lr]::
47408::$$$message_0415_0071_0002$$$::She bows to Lancer, ignoring the filth around them.::
47409::$$$message_0415_0072_0000$$$::"...Hmph. I just felt like it. No need to thank me."[lr]::
47410::$$$message_0415_0072_0001$$$::Suddenly, he collapses limply.::
47411::$$$message_0415_0073_0000$$$::"L-Lancer!?"[lr]::
47412::$$$message_0415_0073_0001$$$::Rin can't catch him in time.[lr]::
47413::$$$message_0415_0073_0002$$$::Lancer's too weak to even lean against the wall now, and he slumps to the ground.[lr]::
47414::$$$message_0415_0073_0003$$$::His legs won't move.[lr]::
47415::$$$message_0415_0073_0004$$$::His limbs were already long dead.[lr]::
47416::$$$message_0415_0073_0005$$$::It seems nonsensical that he managed to stand up, kill his Master and set Rin free.::
47417::$$$message_0415_0074_0000$$$::"Gurgh!"[lr]::
47418::$$$message_0415_0074_0001$$$::A sudden cough of blood stains his blue armor further.[lr]::
47419::$$$message_0415_0074_0002$$$::"...Hold on, I'll close your wounds!"[lr]::
47420::$$$message_0415_0074_0003$$$::Rin rushes over to the bloody spearman.[lr]::
47421::$$$message_0415_0074_0004$$$::But he stops her with a hand.::
47422::$$$message_0415_0075_0000$$$::"Don't bother. It won't be that easy to heal my heart after my Gáe Bolg destroyed it.[lr]::
47423::$$$message_0415_0075_0001$$$::You don't have the energy to spare, anyway."[lr]::
47424::$$$message_0415_0075_0002$$$::"But..."[lr]::
47425::$$$message_0415_0075_0003$$$::"Don't worry about it. I'm used to going out like this. Heroes always end up dying on someone else's absurd orders, you know."[lr]::
47426::$$$message_0415_0075_0004$$$::His easygoing tone is the same as it always is.[lr]::
47427::$$$message_0415_0075_0005$$$::Even seconds away from death, the spearman doesn't change the way he acts.::
47428::$$$message_0415_0076_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
47429::$$$message_0415_0076_0001$$$::Rin stands up wordlessly.[lr]::
47430::$$$message_0415_0076_0002$$$::Seeing that, Lancer breathes a sigh of relief,[lr]::
47431::$$$message_0415_0076_0003$$$::as if a weight was lifted from his shoulders.::
47432::$$$message_0415_0077_0000$$$::"I guess we both drew pretty boring partners, huh?"[lr]::
47433::$$$message_0415_0077_0001$$$::"...Yeah. Though mine's just hard to deal with, not boring."[lr]::
47434::$$$message_0415_0077_0002$$$::"You got that right. I wouldn't complain if I had a woman like you for my partner... Sadly, I've never been involved with any good women.[lr]::
47435::$$$message_0415_0077_0003$$$::Good grief. Looks like that's one habit I'll never fix."[lr]::
47436::$$$message_0415_0077_0004$$$::He chuckles dryly.[lr]::
47437::$$$message_0415_0077_0005$$$::And then...::
47438::$$$message_0415_0078_0000$$$::"Now, hurry on. I'll take him with me.[lr]::
47439::$$$message_0415_0078_0001$$$::You need to get back to your own partner."[lr]::
47440::$$$message_0415_0078_0002$$$::The spearman urges the girl to leave.[lr]::
47441::$$$message_0415_0078_0003$$$::He prepares Ansuz, the fire rune, in his hand.[lr]::
47442::$$$message_0415_0078_0004$$$::As soon as he inscribes it on the ground and charges it with all of his remaining magical energy, it'll burn the entire room to cinders.::
47443::$$$message_0415_0079_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
47444::$$$message_0415_0079_0001$$$::Rin understands his determination, and turns to leave.::
47445::$$$message_0415_0080_0000$$$::"Goodbye, Lancer. I didn't know you long, but I'm fond of people like you."[lr]::
47446::$$$message_0415_0080_0001$$$::She runs off to the great hall.[lr]::
47447::$$$message_0415_0080_0002$$$::"...Ha. Come back when you're older, lass."[lr]::
47448::$$$message_0415_0080_0003$$$::A hearty guffaw escapes his lips.::
47449::$$$message_0415_0081_0000$$$::Flames engulf him.[lr]::
47450::$$$message_0415_0081_0001$$$::The blaze consumes Lancer and his Master's body.[lr]::
47451::$$$message_0415_0081_0002$$$::Not a trace is left behind.[lr]::
47452::$$$message_0415_0081_0003$$$::Like a mirage, the crimson spear and azure armor disappear into the flames.::
