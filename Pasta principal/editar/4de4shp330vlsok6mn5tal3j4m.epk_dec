1879::$$$message_0016_0000_0000$$$::   We finish dinner.[lr]::
1880::$$$message_0016_0000_0001$$$::It was probably a typical dinner...except it didn't feel that way.[lr]::
1881::$$$message_0016_0000_0002$$$::I've lost my appetite since the incident in the bathroom.::
1882::$$$message_0016_0001_0000$$$::"...So cold."[lr]::
1883::$$$message_0016_0001_0001$$$::I had opened a window from the veranda to let the outside wind cool my head, but I need to stop.[lr]::
1884::$$$message_0016_0001_0002$$$::I'm going to catch a cold if I keep this up.::
1885::$$$message_0016_0002_0000$$$::"Shirou, there you are."[lr]::
1886::$$$message_0016_0002_0001$$$::"S-Saber!? D-did you have something?"[lr]::
1887::$$$message_0016_0002_0002$$$::"No, but I thought you did. I thought Rin promised to teach you magecraft tonight."::
1888::$$$message_0016_0003_0000$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
1889::$$$message_0016_0003_0001$$$::I smack my forehead.[lr]::
1890::$$$message_0016_0003_0002$$$::"I completely forgot. Thanks. I'll head over there right away!"::
1891::$$$message_0016_0004_0000$$$::I rush to the outbuilding and head upstairs.[lr]::
1892::$$$message_0016_0004_0001$$$::I knock on the door to the guestroom that Tohsaka has taken up occupancy in.[lr]::
1893::$$$message_0016_0004_0002$$$::"Shirou? I have my hands full, so just come on in, it's fine."[lr]::
1894::$$$message_0016_0004_0003$$$::Tohsaka's voice sounds from inside the room, but she sounds a little unnerved.::
1895::$$$message_0016_0005_0000$$$::I walk in to see Tohsaka holding a jewel in one hand, a syringe in the other, and a handkerchief in her mouth.::
1896::$$$message_0016_0006_0000$$$::"I...have questions, Tohsaka."[lr]::
1897::$$$message_0016_0006_0001$$$::"Hoh on. I'mh holmoss hone wih hohah's koha..."::
1898::$$$message_0016_0007_0000$$$::She sticks a needle in her arm as she speaks, her mouth full.[lr]::
1899::$$$message_0016_0007_0001$$$::...She draws blood into the syringe.[lr]::
1900::$$$message_0016_0007_0002$$$::Tohsaka slowly drips blood from the syringe onto the jewel, then grips it tightly.::
1901::$$$message_0016_0008_0000$$$::A wave of vertigo washes over me.[lr]::
1902::$$$message_0016_0008_0001$$$::I can tell it's a ripple of magical energy.::
1903::$$$message_0016_0009_0000$$$::"...Even after all that, it's only at thirty percent. I guess I'll have to make do with just the nine I have."[lr]::
1904::$$$message_0016_0009_0001$$$::Tohsaka slumps her shoulders in disappointment, and puts the stone back into a jewelry box.::
1905::$$$message_0016_0010_0000$$$::"Tohsaka. I came here to learn from you, as promised."[lr]::
1906::$$$message_0016_0010_0001$$$::But before we get to that, I'm curious about what I just saw.::
1907::$$$message_0016_0011_0000$$$::"Yes, I was waiting for you. You fortified your body with Saber during the day, right? Then we need to train your mind at night."::
1908::$$$message_0016_0012_0000$$$::Tohsaka seems happy, ready to teach.[lr]::
1909::$$$message_0016_0012_0001$$$::Hm. Saber said she wasn't good at teaching, but I'm guessing this will be the total opposite.[lr]::
1910::$$$message_0016_0012_0002$$$::Anyway...::
1911::$$$message_0016_0013_0000$$$::"So...what should we start with? You mentioned that you can only use Strengthening magecraft..."[lr]::
1912::$$$message_0016_0013_0001$$$::"Uh, actually before we start, I need to know, or else it's going to bother me.[lr]::
1913::$$$message_0016_0013_0002$$$::What the hell were you just doing? Sticking yourself with a needle is dangerous."::
1914::$$$message_0016_0014_0000$$$::"Eh, huh? I was just making magic bullets. My family's style of magecraft uses the flow and conversion of power. Whenever I have the time, I transfer my magical energy to other objects."::
1915::$$$message_0016_0015_0000$$$::"Wait. What are magic bullets, and what's the point of transferring magical energy?"::
1916::$$$message_0016_0016_0000$$$::"Magic bullets are exactly what they sound like: bullets filled with magical energy.[lr]::
1917::$$$message_0016_0016_0001$$$::Have you ever heard stories where jewels contain human emotions and thoughts? Jewels in general can easily store magical energy, and it seems like my family has always been really well-suited to the practice."::
1918::$$$message_0016_0017_0000$$$::"If you don't do anything for, say, a day, you wind up with an excess of magical energy. So, I put that extra energy into jewels.[lr]::
1919::$$$message_0016_0017_0001$$$::I repeat this for days, months, and even years, and that turns the jewels themselves into magecraft." ::
1920::$$$message_0016_0018_0000$$$::"The jewels obviously have limited capacity, and I can't control magical energy outside myself.[lr]::
1921::$$$message_0016_0018_0001$$$::The magical energy inside the jewels works like an ignition source to instantly activate a large-scale magecraft."::
1922::$$$message_0016_0019_0000$$$::"Hm? So you're saying you fill these jewels with your own magical energy as a backup?"[lr]::
1923::$$$message_0016_0019_0001$$$::"Backup...like combat support? Mmm...that's close, but not quite right. It's more like stuffing something into a disposable pack."::
1924::$$$message_0016_0020_0000$$$::"So, it's like you're temporarily expanding a computer hard disk. That's amazing. You'd be able to use as much magecraft as you want with that kind of skill."::
1925::$$$message_0016_0021_0000$$$::"Hard...disk? No idea what that is, but it's also not as great as you think. The moment I infuse the jewel with magical energy, the magical energy is bound by the jewel's attributes, which limits how I can use it."::
1926::$$$message_0016_0022_0000$$$::"Yeah? But magical energy never ceases to surprise me. I didn't know you could store it like that.[lr]::
1927::$$$message_0016_0022_0001$$$::Why don't other mages do something so useful?"::
1928::$$$message_0016_0023_0000$$$::"The ability to store magical energy in something outside yourself is unique.[lr]::
1929::$$$message_0016_0023_0001$$$::Even your Strengthening magecraft involves infusing your magical energy into another object too, right? Things that pass magical energy typically change, using up that magical energy. The effects of magecraft are instantaneous and never permanent."::
1930::$$$message_0016_0024_0000$$$::"What my family does is make it so the magical energy flows into jewels, where they become permanent objects...but other mages can do something similar to their own bodies.[lr]::
1931::$$$message_0016_0024_0001$$$::That's what Magic Crests are... A kind of backup magecraft mages possess."::
1932::$$$message_0016_0025_0000$$$::"Magic Crests...oh yeah, secrets that parents pass down to their children. I don't have anything like that so I'm kind of clueless about them."::
1933::$$$message_0016_0026_0000$$$::"Wait. What did you just say?"[lr]::
1934::$$$message_0016_0026_0001$$$::"Huh? Well, I just said I don't have a Magic Crest. My old man had one, but I didn't inherit it."[lr]::
1935::$$$message_0016_0026_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false]::
1936::$$$message_0016_0027_0000$$$::Tohsaka catches her breath, but then the next minute, she seems to understand.::
1937::$$$message_0016_0028_0000$$$::"No wonder you're such an amateur. So you really started from zero. Then I guess there's no helping it."::
1938::$$$message_0016_0029_0000$$$::"Tohsaka... Haven't you known I don't have a Magic Crest for a long time now?"::
1939::$$$message_0016_0030_0000$$$::"Of course not. If I knew, I would have never let you go out and do stuff on your own. Sure, I knew you weren't fully trained, but if you don't have a Magic Crest, you aren't even a mage."::
1940::$$$message_0016_0031_0000$$$::She huffs and looks at me, seeming to be complaining.[lr]::
1941::$$$message_0016_0031_0001$$$::But...what is this?[lr]::
1942::$$$message_0016_0031_0002$$$::Her voice sounds almost warm... Like she is a little bit relieved... Like she's jealous I'm not a mage.::
1943::$$$message_0016_0032_0000$$$::"Well, whatever. This just means I have to teach you everything from scratch. But since you know what Magic Crests are, you know what a mage is.[lr]::
1944::$$$message_0016_0032_0001$$$::Okay. Sit over there, Shirou. I need you to really pay attention because this is important stuff."::
1945::$$$message_0016_0033_0000$$$::"Right here? Okay, go ahead."[lr]::
1946::$$$message_0016_0033_0001$$$::I brace myself and look straight at Tohsaka.[lr]::
1947::$$$message_0016_0033_0002$$$::Tohsaka nods approvingly, satisfied by my show of seriousness.::
1948::$$$message_0016_0034_0000$$$::"I'll start with something simple.[lr]::
1949::$$$message_0016_0034_0001$$$::You already know that you need magical energy to use magecraft. You can actually refer to anything that can activate magecraft as magical energy.[lr]::
1950::$$$message_0016_0034_0002$$$::There are endless varieties of magical energy.[lr]::
1951::$$$message_0016_0034_0003$$$::Some may use magecraft via their own means, while some may do it by paying a price of some sort.[lr]::
1952::$$$message_0016_0034_0004$$$::You at least know that, right?"::
1953::$$$message_0016_0035_0000$$$::"Yeah. You're talking about mana and od. Mana is magical energy that's found throughout the world, while od is magical energy an individual can create themselves."[lr]::
1954::$$$message_0016_0035_0001$$$::"Yep, yep. Good job. Let me start by explaining the types of magecraft that use mana."::
1955::$$$message_0016_0036_0000$$$::"Listen. Mages who don't have so much history, like you, employ something that already has taken form to use magical energy.[lr]::
1956::$$$message_0016_0036_0001$$$::It's a method based on a long established system of rituals using offerings to make contact with Mystics."::
1957::$$$message_0016_0037_0000$$$::"It's called Formal Craft...a negotiation technique where a mage prepares a compensation of sorts to make a deal because their own power is insufficient.[lr]::
1958::$$$message_0016_0037_0001$$$::This way, even a caster with weak magical energy can use magecraft. They don't need to use their own magical energy because they're borrowing it from elsewhere[line2]from mana[line2]so the caster only has to perform a ritual."::
1959::$$$message_0016_0038_0000$$$::"But you need knowledge to pull something like this off. You're not at the right level to do something like this. Besides, something reeking of blood probably wouldn't be your style anyway."::
1960::$$$message_0016_0039_0000$$$::"Yeah. I wouldn't want to do stuff like sacrifice chickens or pray for a whole night inside a magic circle."::
1961::$$$message_0016_0040_0000$$$::"Right?[lr]::
1962::$$$message_0016_0040_0001$$$::Then let's move on and talk about od...magecraft that uses the mage's own power.[lr]::
1963::$$$message_0016_0040_0002$$$::This probably doesn't bear mentioning, but it is the basic method for using the magecraft you and I practice.[lr]::
1964::$$$message_0016_0040_0003$$$::Your Strengthening magecraft only uses your own Magic Circuits without using anybody else's power, right?"::
1965::$$$message_0016_0041_0000$$$::I nod.[lr]::
1966::$$$message_0016_0041_0001$$$::It seems she's getting into the nitty-gritty stuff now.::
1967::$$$message_0016_0042_0000$$$::"Right. The Magic Circuits that function to create your own magical energy are a hereditary trait passed down through generations.[lr]::
1968::$$$message_0016_0042_0001$$$::Magic Circuits are forged over many generations, and get more powerful as they're passed down to the next generation and so on.[lr]::
1969::$$$message_0016_0042_0002$$$::The child of a mage family is already fit to use magical energy because of this. It may not be fair, but you and I had different starting points."::
1970::$$$message_0016_0043_0000$$$::"I know that. It doesn't bother me. Keep going."[lr]::
1971::$$$message_0016_0043_0001$$$::"I wasn't too worried about that either...[lr]::
1972::$$$message_0016_0043_0002$$$::But whatever. Anyway, other than Magic Circuits, mage families also have secret magecrafts that they cultivate over generations."  ::
1973::$$$message_0016_0044_0000$$$::"It's similar to my jewels you saw earlier. Once a certain magecraft is mastered, a mage can physically 'hold' that magecraft.[lr]::
1974::$$$message_0016_0044_0001$$$::Do you know that feeling of getting ahold of magecraft, even though it's typically shapeless and simply devised?"::
1975::$$$message_0016_0045_0000$$$::"I don't, but I'm guessing it's like it becomes a part of your body."::
1976::$$$message_0016_0046_0000$$$::"Bingo.[lr]::
1977::$$$message_0016_0046_0001$$$::Magecraft that goes beyond the realm of principle and becomes a part of you then becomes tangible.[lr]::
1978::$$$message_0016_0046_0002$$$::It's a feat that can authenticate an otherwise unstable magecraft, and at the same time, it becomes the testimony of that mage's existence."::
1979::$$$message_0016_0047_0000$$$::"And when a mage is on the brink of death, they pass down their great accomplishments to their successor in the form of a crest. It's their way of telling their successor to go further, to places they were unable to reach, and that their crest may be of some use to them.[lr]::
1980::$$$message_0016_0047_0001$$$::Though to be honest, both the one handing down the crest and the one receiving it know it's of no help."::
1981::$$$message_0016_0048_0000$$$::"Huh? What? Are you saying that something so awesome is useless?"::
1982::$$$message_0016_0049_0000$$$::"It IS useful! An ordinary mage would consider a single crest to be like a security blanket. It's THAT helpful![lr]::
1983::$$$message_0016_0049_0001$$$::But then again, it's like getting a car. No matter how fast it is on the road, it's never going to take you to the moon."[lr]::
1984::$$$message_0016_0049_0002$$$::[font italic=true]Huh?[font italic=false]::
1985::$$$message_0016_0050_0000$$$::"Just forget that part. Let's move on.[lr]::
1986::$$$message_0016_0050_0001$$$::You might know this already, but this crest is what's called a Magic Crest."::
1987::$$$message_0016_0051_0000$$$::"The head of the mage family spends their entire life completing their magecraft and makes it into a crest to pass it down to their descendants, and the descendant completes another magecraft and adds it to the crest, which gets passed down to the next descendant.[lr]::
1988::$$$message_0016_0051_0001$$$::The Magic Crest gets more complex as it passes from generation to generation, but it's also a constraint mages can't escape."::
1989::$$$message_0016_0052_0000$$$::"So what you're saying is that the entire history of a mage family is recorded in these Magic Crests?"::
1990::$$$message_0016_0053_0000$$$::"No, that's not it. Family records are recorded in books. Magic Crests only contain magecraft.[lr]::
1991::$$$message_0016_0053_0001$$$::It can cast spells on its own, or it can let you use magecraft you haven't mastered yet.[lr]::
1992::$$$message_0016_0053_0002$$$::In simpler terms, it's like having magic circles engraved on your body."::
1993::$$$message_0016_0054_0000$$$::"Huh. Then doesn't that mean you can engrave the crests onto anyone. If magic circles are all you need, then you can draw as many as you want as long as you know the shape."::
1994::$$$message_0016_0055_0000$$$::"That's not how it works.[lr]::
1995::$$$message_0016_0055_0001$$$::Magic Crests are like living things. It's more like transplanting an organ.[lr]::
1996::$$$message_0016_0055_0002$$$::There's only one organ, so you can't split it amongst other people or copy it. There's no point in splitting a heart in half, because it'd just stop working, right?"::
1997::$$$message_0016_0056_0000$$$::"Oh...yeah, you have a point. Does that mean you also have a crest implanted in you too?"::
1998::$$$message_0016_0057_0000$$$::"'Implanted' is a pretty backwards way to put it, if I do say so myself.[lr]::
1999::$$$message_0016_0057_0001$$$::In my case it's on my left arm. It covers my entire arm from my shoulders to my hand. It doesn't show up as long as I'm not using it, so I don't have to hide it like with Command Spells."::
2000::$$$message_0016_0058_0000$$$::"So that's why a mage family only has a single heir.[lr]::
2001::$$$message_0016_0058_0001$$$::If a family has multiple siblings, typically any not chosen to be the successor would not be taught magecraft and would instead live an ordinary life. The Magic Crest can't be passed down to them, so there's no point in them being a mage."::
2002::$$$message_0016_0059_0000$$$::"Yeah, Shinji said that too. I get it. So that's why Sakura wasn't taught any magecraft."::
2003::$$$message_0016_0060_0000$$$::"Right. But the crest inheritance stopped a few generations ago in the Matou family, so I assume Shinji only learned [font italic=true]about[font italic=false] magecraft.[lr]::
2004::$$$message_0016_0060_0001$$$::Honestly, those are the most annoying sorts out there. They can't really feel what magecraft is, but they still try to use it."[lr]::
2005::$$$message_0016_0060_0002$$$::Tohsaka sighs a deep breath, swearing quietly.::
2006::$$$message_0016_0061_0000$$$::"Well, I was supposed to teach you magecraft, but we got a little sidetracked. I'll need to come up with a different approach now that I know you don't have a Magic Crest.[lr]::
2007::$$$message_0016_0061_0001$$$::Let's call it a night for now. I'll prepare some things for you tomorrow, so we'll do more then."::
2008::$$$message_0016_0062_0000$$$::"Oh? I'll just have to trust you then...and what do you mean, you're going to prepare things?"::
2009::$$$message_0016_0063_0000$$$::"I mean a lot of things. Since you have no crest, you don't have a switch. I'm going to go in and tamper with your body, so we'll need medicine and other tools."::
2010::$$$message_0016_0064_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
2011::$$$message_0016_0064_0001$$$::A chill runs down my spine.::
2012::$$$message_0016_0065_0000$$$::"What? I'll stop if you don't want to do it. But if so, there won't be much I can teach you."[lr]::
2013::$$$message_0016_0065_0001$$$::"Uh...well I don't want to, but I'm still going to ask you. Whatever you say is probably the right way to go."::
2014::$$$message_0016_0067_0000$$$::"Then that's what we'll do tomorrow.[lr]::
2015::$$$message_0016_0067_0001$$$::Oh, right... Are you planning on training with Saber tomorrow too?"::
2016::$$$message_0016_0068_0000$$$::"Huh? Well, yeah. I'm concerned about the Bounded Field over the school, but there's still some time before it activates. I want to at least be able to fight by then."::
2017::$$$message_0016_0069_0000$$$::"I see. Well, not that it's important to me, but it seems like you and Saber aren't getting along."[lr]::
2018::$$$message_0016_0069_0001$$$::"Ugh...well, that..."::
2019::$$$message_0016_0070_0000$$$::"You managed to talk normally before dinner, but you got all quiet at dinner.[lr]::
2020::$$$message_0016_0070_0001$$$::I just want to check: Are you two getting along? If you two end up bickering during battle, I'm going to suffer the consequences too, you know?"::
2021::$$$message_0016_0071_0000$$$::Ugh...[lr]::
2022::$$$message_0016_0071_0001$$$::It's just that something happened right before dinner, and now things are awkward.[lr]::
2023::$$$message_0016_0071_0002$$$::That's all...but I'm not sure if Saber and I are really getting along.[lr]::
2024::$$$message_0016_0071_0003$$$::When I spent all day dueling her, I think I got a sense of what Saber is like.::
2025::$$$message_0016_0072_0000$$$::I trust Saber as an ally.[lr]::
2026::$$$message_0016_0072_0001$$$::No question about that.[lr]::
2027::$$$message_0016_0072_0002$$$::But if someone asked me how I feel about Saber in other senses, I wouldn't know how to answer.[lr]::
2028::$$$message_0016_0072_0003$$$::Because I...[lr]::
2029::$$$message_0016_0072_0004$$$::...lost all sense in that very moment.::
2030::$$$message_0016_0073_0000$$$::"It's hard to say. But what about you, Tohsaka? Do you like Saber?"::
2031::$$$message_0016_0074_0000$$$::"I do. There's nothing about her I don't like really.[lr]::
2032::$$$message_0016_0074_0001$$$::She's strong, polite, and pretty. A huge difference from my Mister Cynic."[lr]::
2033::$$$message_0016_0074_0002$$$::"Huh. I see. So you like Saber."::
2034::$$$message_0016_0075_0000$$$::"What!? All I said was I like more about her than I don't! Quit being so blunt, or you'll make enemies!"::
2035::$$$message_0016_0076_0000$$$::"I refuse. I've never been good with words anyway."::
