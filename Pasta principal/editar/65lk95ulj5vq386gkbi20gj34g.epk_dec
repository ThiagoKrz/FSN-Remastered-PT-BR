53840::$$$message_0468_0000_0001$$$::She sees her friend off, an odd timbre in her farewell.[lr]::
53841::$$$message_0468_0000_0002$$$::No one else is around, and the traffic circle is completely still.[lr]::
53842::$$$message_0468_0000_0003$$$::Did her friend take the last taxi home, or are they all occupied?[lr]::
53843::$$$message_0468_0000_0004$$$::In any case, the park in front of the train station, usually well-lit and filled with loiterers, is cold and lifeless.::
53844::$$$message_0468_0001_0000$$$::"Mmm... I guess it's that kind of night."[lr]::
53845::$$$message_0468_0001_0001$$$::She walks home, tipsy.[lr]::
53846::$$$message_0468_0001_0002$$$::She doesn't mind that the last train already left, nor that there aren't any taxis nearby.::
53847::$$$message_0468_0002_0000$$$::Her apartment is just around the corner.[lr]::
53848::$$$message_0468_0002_0001$$$::She's used to going home alone after seeing off her friend who lives in the town three train stops away.[lr]::
53849::$$$message_0468_0002_0002$$$::She walks through the middle of the roundabout, abandoned even though it isn't midnight yet, and takes the path home in high spirits.::
53850::$$$message_0468_0003_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
53851::$$$message_0468_0003_0001$$$::And yet...[lr]::
53852::$$$message_0468_0003_0002$$$::When did it all stop being just another night?::
53853::$$$message_0468_0004_0000$$$::An empty city.[lr]::
53854::$$$message_0468_0004_0001$$$::A back alley the light doesn't reach.[lr]::
53855::$$$message_0468_0004_0002$$$::The cold creeping out from the shadows.[lr]::
53856::$$$message_0468_0004_0003$$$::Some formless anxiety grates away her composure.[lr]::
53857::$$$message_0468_0004_0004$$$::"Hey, is someone there?"[lr]::
53858::$$$message_0468_0004_0005$$$::She turns around. Her follower is a silent, unfriendly shadow.::
53859::$$$message_0468_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
53860::$$$message_0468_0005_0001$$$::She quickens her walk.[lr]::
53861::$$$message_0468_0005_0002$$$::She begins to think it's dangerous to be here.[lr]::
53862::$$$message_0468_0005_0003$$$::She doesn't think she's overreacting.[lr]::
53863::$$$message_0468_0005_0004$$$::She doesn't feel anyone following her. To begin with, her instincts aren't good enough to sense danger even if someone was stalking her.[lr]::
53864::$$$message_0468_0005_0005$$$::She's just a normal, decent city-dweller.::
53865::$$$message_0468_0006_0000$$$::"Wait, what's going on..."[lr]::
53866::$$$message_0468_0006_0001$$$::And yet, she suddenly begins to tremble.[lr]::
53867::$$$message_0468_0006_0002$$$::The unpleasant feeling intensifies.[lr]::
53868::$$$message_0468_0006_0003$$$::This is just like that one time when she was a child, when she woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't move.[lr]::
53869::$$$message_0468_0006_0004$$$::It feels like the anxiety of having the entire world reject her, like that night when she thought someone was lurking in the corner of her bedroom. She couldn't even get up to go to the bathroom and pretended to sleep until morning.::
53870::$$$message_0468_0007_0000$$$::"...Nn...hah...hah..."[lr]::
53871::$$$message_0468_0007_0001$$$::Before she knows it, she's jogging.[lr]::
53872::$$$message_0468_0007_0002$$$::This isn't her usual route home.[lr]::
53873::$$$message_0468_0007_0003$$$::The path before her is dangerous.[lr]::
53874::$$$message_0468_0007_0004$$$::Either path is pitch black.[lr]::
53875::$$$message_0468_0007_0005$$$::Relying on the same intuition that told her she was in danger, she finds herself nearly stumbling as she runs towards "safety".::
53876::$$$message_0468_0008_0000$$$::"Hah, hah, hah!"[lr]::
53877::$$$message_0468_0008_0001$$$::When did the jog become a headlong sprint?[lr]::
53878::$$$message_0468_0008_0002$$$::She knows that it's comical to be so afraid of something she can't even see, but she can't stop.::
53879::$$$message_0468_0009_0000$$$::She scrambles down the street like a mad dog.[lr]::
53880::$$$message_0468_0009_0001$$$::It's strange how her throat is parched, yet she isn't sweating at all.::
53881::$$$message_0468_0010_0000$$$::   The city at night.[lr]::
53882::$$$message_0468_0010_0001$$$::A string of unexplained accidents.[lr]::
53883::$$$message_0468_0010_0002$$$::She tells herself that the rumors never mentioned anything about a slasher.[lr]::
53884::$$$message_0468_0010_0003$$$::There's no one else around.[lr]::
53885::$$$message_0468_0010_0004$$$::Tonight of all nights, the streets are empty.[lr]::
53886::$$$message_0468_0010_0005$$$::Does no one really care?[lr]::
53887::$$$message_0468_0010_0006$$$::It feels like she's in an imitation of the city she knows so well, in a place where no one will ever find her.::
53888::$$$message_0468_0011_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
53889::$$$message_0468_0011_0001$$$::At last, she comes to the end of the line.::
53890::$$$message_0468_0012_0000$$$::"That's weird. Why..."[lr]::
53891::$$$message_0468_0012_0001$$$::Why did she come here?[lr]::
53892::$$$message_0468_0012_0002$$$::"Aha. What am I even doing?"[lr]::
53893::$$$message_0468_0012_0003$$$::It's so hilarious.[lr]::
53894::$$$message_0468_0012_0004$$$::"Haha. Ahahaha. Ahahahaha."[lr]::
53895::$$$message_0468_0012_0005$$$::She belly laughs because it's funny. Her throat feels like it belongs to someone else.::
53896::$$$message_0468_0013_0000$$$::All she did was run.[lr]::
53897::$$$message_0468_0013_0001$$$::She thought that there would be no going back if she took the normal way home.[lr]::
53898::$$$message_0468_0013_0002$$$::So she chose a different route that would take her to a safe place. And now...[lr]::
53899::$$$message_0468_0013_0003$$$::"Ha. Ahahaha, ahahahahahahahahahaha!"[lr]::
53900::$$$message_0468_0013_0004$$$::   Finally...[lr]::
53901::$$$message_0468_0013_0005$$$::She realizes that there was never any escape to begin with.::
53902::$$$message_0468_0014_0000$$$::Just as something can jump at you out of the grass,[lr]::
53903::$$$message_0468_0014_0001$$$::other things can pounce on you from the tree branches.[lr]::
53904::$$$message_0468_0014_0002$$$::At first, it drops on her head[line2][lr]::
53905::$$$message_0468_0015_0000$$$::"............!!!!"[lr]::
53906::$$$message_0468_0015_0001$$$::Nobody hears her scream.[lr]::
53907::$$$message_0468_0015_0002$$$::Her body hits the pavement.[lr]::
53908::$$$message_0468_0015_0003$$$::There's sharp pain in her ankles. It hurts so bad it must be a joke. Like she's lost everything from the heel down.::
53909::$$$message_0468_0016_0000$$$::"[block len=12]"[lr]::
53910::$$$message_0468_0016_0001$$$::That can't possibly be true, so she tries wiggling her fingers, only to find that she can't feel anything.[lr]::
53911::$$$message_0468_0016_0002$$$::Instead, something is burrowing into the part of her that's missing.[lr]::
53912::$$$message_0468_0016_0003$$$::With bloody but still functioning eyes, she looks to see what it is.::
53913::$$$message_0468_0017_0000$$$::But she can't see it anymore.[lr]::
53914::$$$message_0468_0017_0001$$$::All she knows is that something she doesn't understand is gathering in her body.[lr]::
53915::$$$message_0468_0017_0002$$$::"...Aha[line2]"[lr]::
53916::$$$message_0468_0017_0003$$$::For some reason, her eyes can't process what they see.::
53917::$$$message_0468_0018_0000$$$::The worms wriggle their way inside.[lr]::
53918::$$$message_0468_0018_0001$$$::When she was a child, she once saw a bathtub sponge infested by maggots.[lr]::
53919::$$$message_0468_0018_0002$$$::This looks just like that.[lr]::
53920::$$$message_0468_0018_0003$$$::A closer image would be inchworms squirming in an apple's holes.::
53921::$$$message_0468_0019_0000$$$::"Eek[line2]Aha, but, that's so weird."[lr]::
53922::$$$message_0468_0019_0001$$$::The realistic images don't line up with the events unfolding before her eyes.[lr]::
53923::$$$message_0468_0019_0002$$$::After all, this can't be happening.[lr]::
53924::$$$message_0468_0019_0003$$$::Not to her.[lr]::
53925::$$$message_0468_0019_0004$$$::It'll be midnight soon.[lr]::
53926::$$$message_0468_0019_0005$$$::i need to go home, fill up the bath, ouch, laugh about all the stuff that happened today, it hurts, and while i dry my hair, it hurts, i'll catch up on all the shows i recorded, go back to my roomroomroom[line2]::
53927::$$$message_0468_0020_0000$$$::set my alarm i wanna go home wake up in the morning go home oww go to work eek need to go home go home go home.[lr]::
53928::$$$message_0468_0020_0001$$$::"So I need to go to work, I want to go home, I want go home, I want go home...[lr]::
53929::$$$message_0468_0020_0002$$$::Go away, it's not right, stop it, stop, plea[line2]please, let me go home, please, PLEEEEEASE, NOOOO, STOP IT, ALL OF YOU, WHY ME, WHY WHY WHY!!!"::
53930::$$$message_0468_0021_0000$$$::    The tragedy ends in less than five minutes.[lr]::
53931::$$$message_0468_0021_0001$$$::It was a gruesome scene that might be described as a meal, if one were to define meal as the simple acquisition of nutrition.::
53932::$$$message_0468_0022_0000$$$::"Murgh...nrh."[lr]::
53933::$$$message_0468_0022_0001$$$::The fallen [font italic=true]thing[font italic=false] rises.[lr]::
53934::$$$message_0468_0022_0002$$$::What was once a woman can only now be described as a wizened old man.::
53935::$$$message_0468_0023_0000$$$::"Gurgh...mm. This swapping of heads is the part I can never get used to."[lr]::
53936::$$$message_0468_0023_0001$$$::A hoarse voice rasps.[lr]::
53937::$$$message_0468_0023_0002$$$::The swarm of insects is gone.[lr]::
53938::$$$message_0468_0023_0003$$$::Having finished their meal, they returned to their nest inside the aged body.[lr]::
53939::$$$message_0468_0023_0004$$$::In other words, they hollowed out the inside of the woman and turned it into their own.::
53940::$$$message_0468_0024_0000$$$::Something witnessed it happen.::
53941::$$$message_0468_0025_0000$$$::Up above,[lr]::
53942::$$$message_0468_0025_0001$$$::a mismatched white face floats in the gaps between tree branches.[lr]::
53943::$$$message_0468_0025_0002$$$::It is a mask made of a human skull, locked in a jester's smile.::
53944::$$$message_0468_0026_0000$$$::Its owner is, of course,[lr]::
53945::$$$message_0468_0026_0001$$$::the seventh Servant who killed Lancer[line2]Assassin, the Master-less Heroic Spirit born from a false Servant.::
53946::$$$message_0468_0027_0000$$$::"Very clever. So your previous body was a borrowed one as well?"[lr]::
53947::$$$message_0468_0027_0001$$$::"Oh? Were you watching, Assassin? Yes, my original body has long since wasted away. Now I am reduced to a body that can only parasitize others and cannot go out under the light of the sun, like those others."::
53948::$$$message_0468_0028_0000$$$::The cackling comes from none other than Zouken Matou.[lr]::
53949::$$$message_0468_0028_0001$$$::It took him only minutes to attack and take over the woman.[lr]::
53950::$$$message_0468_0028_0002$$$::No matter how impressive a mage he is, the speed of the act was abnormal.::
53951::$$$message_0468_0029_0000$$$::"...I see. The woman's body itself doesn't matter. You simply needed a person's weight in flesh so that you could remake it in your own image.[lr]::
53952::$$$message_0468_0029_0001$$$::After all, the inside is filled with insects that fulfill your human functions... Like mimicry."::
53953::$$$message_0468_0030_0000$$$::"Oh-ho? You've become so loquacious in the span of only a single day. Then, have you remembered your wish?"::
53954::$$$message_0468_0031_0000$$$::"Of course. We are only summoned by those who share the same desire. Lord Mage, your craving for immortality is what invited me here. Thus, I wish only for eternity.[lr]::
53955::$$$message_0468_0031_0001$$$::Although..."[lr]::
53956::$$$message_0468_0031_0002$$$::The black shadow sways.[lr]::
53957::$$$message_0468_0031_0003$$$::The expressionless skull mask eyes the old mage dubiously.::
53958::$$$message_0468_0032_0000$$$::"I now have questions. You are already deathless, having lived for over five centuries. Is your wish not already granted?"[lr]::
53959::$$$message_0468_0032_0001$$$::"Oh?"[lr]::
53960::$$$message_0468_0032_0002$$$::The old mage's shoulders tremble as he raises his voice.[lr]::
53961::$$$message_0468_0032_0003$$$::Who can tell whether his laugh is one of joy or rage?::
53962::$$$message_0468_0033_0000$$$::   Indeed, Zouken Matou is nearly immortal.[lr]::
53963::$$$message_0468_0033_0001$$$::With a body like that of a nest, he will continue to live as long as his soul's vessel remains intact.::
53964::$$$message_0468_0034_0000$$$::But it is a life of agony.[lr]::
53965::$$$message_0468_0034_0001$$$::Zouken does not maintain this old man's form out of preference.::
53966::$$$message_0468_0035_0000$$$::He has transformed into something inhuman, masquerading as a man.[lr]::
53967::$$$message_0468_0035_0001$$$::There are limits to his magecraft.[lr]::
53968::$$$message_0468_0035_0002$$$::It is not unlike a machine. Even if perpetual operation is possible in theory, his parts still suffer from wear.[lr]::
53969::$$$message_0468_0035_0003$$$::Parts rust. Cogs fail to align. Programming/Cognition fails to keep up with the evolving times.::
53970::$$$message_0468_0036_0000$$$::"I am no immortal at all, Assassin.[lr]::
53971::$$$message_0468_0036_0001$$$::My body rots. No matter how many new bodies I acquire, they eventually decay. Nothing I do can stave off the inevitable.[lr]::
53972::$$$message_0468_0036_0002$$$::Even this new body has already begun to deteriorate.[lr]::
53973::$$$message_0468_0036_0003$$$::Perhaps you would understand if I told you to imagine the displeasure and humiliation of living in a decaying body, if I described the despair of being more vermin than man."::
53974::$$$message_0468_0037_0000$$$::"Why do you decay? Can the insects not make you a proper body?"::
53975::$$$message_0468_0038_0000$$$::"Haha! That won't happen. They're very lively, you know. There is no physical problem. I first turned myself into a parasite to avoid the ravages of old age. On the physical front, I have no weakness.[lr]::
53976::$$$message_0468_0038_0001$$$::I chose this way to extend my life in order to live forever as a human."::
53977::$$$message_0468_0039_0000$$$::"...I fail to understand. If you have acquired such a flawless body, then how does that explain your fate? And why do you shape yourself like an old man?[lr]::
53978::$$$message_0468_0039_0001$$$::If you can mold flesh like clay, I would think you can choose any form you wish."::
53979::$$$message_0468_0040_0000$$$::"A good question. Then let me ask you to imagine a man who has lost his original body and uses only his own power to restore it.[lr]::
53980::$$$message_0468_0040_0001$$$::In that case, would he be able to regain his original form?"[lr]::
53981::$$$message_0468_0040_0002$$$::"The flesh records itself. Even if it is skinned and torn, it contains a genetic blueprint which tells it how to regrow into its former shape."::
53982::$$$message_0468_0041_0000$$$::"Indeed, genes are recorded blueprints. But it is different in my case. I have lost those physical genes which recorded my body's structure. I have no blueprints with which to rebuild my body.[lr]::
53983::$$$message_0468_0041_0001$$$::In that case, what can I use to remember and reshape myself into my original form?"::
53984::$$$message_0468_0042_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
53985::$$$message_0468_0042_0001$$$::The answer is obvious: [lr]::
53986::$$$message_0468_0042_0002$$$::his soul.[lr]::
53987::$$$message_0468_0042_0003$$$::The soul is a memory of the world itself; a record of a body bound not by the physical realm's laws like the flesh, but existing on a higher plane, belonging to a concept known as the astral realm.[lr]::
53988::$$$message_0468_0042_0004$$$::...Yes, as long as the soul is intact, it could be possible to restore one's past self even after the loss of one's body, one's genes, even one's very cells.[lr]::
53989::$$$message_0468_0042_0005$$$::Meaning that this old mage...::
53990::$$$message_0468_0043_0000$$$::"...I see. You sustain the life of your soul alone while harvesting flesh from other living creatures. That is the nature of your immortality.[lr]::
53991::$$$message_0468_0043_0001$$$::That is why you cannot take any other form. The only living part of you left, Lord Mage, is your soul.[lr]::
53992::$$$message_0468_0043_0002$$$::Thus, you can only resemble Zouken Matou."::
53993::$$$message_0468_0044_0000$$$::"Naturally. I don't [font italic=true]want[font italic=false] an old man's body.[lr]::
53994::$$$message_0468_0044_0001$$$::...You must understand, this is the only form that I can create. It is a flawed thing that rots away unless I replace it regularly. Once, I could go fifty years or more before needing to replace it, but now I cannot even survive a few months without a replacement.[lr]::
53995::$$$message_0468_0044_0002$$$::...Can you possibly understand the pain of such a short, rotting life? Do not mistake me, Assassin of this war. This is not immortality."::
53996::$$$message_0468_0045_0000$$$::Frustration tinges the old mage's voice.[lr]::
53997::$$$message_0468_0045_0001$$$::It has been three days since Assassin was summoned.[lr]::
53998::$$$message_0468_0045_0002$$$::The killer finally knows who his summoner is.::
53999::$$$message_0468_0046_0000$$$::"...I understand now. So it is not your body that is decaying..."[lr]::
54000::$$$message_0468_0046_0001$$$::"...But my very soul.[lr]::
54001::$$$message_0468_0046_0002$$$::Even spectral bodies are susceptible to the ravages of time. That is why my body rots. If my soul which serves as its blueprint is decaying, then it only stands to reason that the flesh would decay as well."::
54002::$$$message_0468_0047_0000$$$::"Hm. And so you seek the Holy Grail.[lr]::
54003::$$$message_0468_0047_0001$$$::...I understand your anger. The eternity you experience is worse than that of those who only know a half-done eternity."[lr]::
54004::$$$message_0468_0047_0002$$$::"That's right.[lr]::
54005::$$$message_0468_0047_0003$$$::...My body rots. It decays. I seek release from this pain, this poison of time that ravages my very bones...![lr]::
54006::$$$message_0468_0047_0004$$$::That is why I need the Holy Grail. Why I need an undying body."::
54007::$$$message_0468_0048_0000$$$::"Yes, I don't want to die. I still want to exist! The thought of disappearing from this world terrifies me![lr]::
54008::$$$message_0468_0048_0001$$$::That is why I have lived for centuries and consumed countless bodies, to escape the decay, to avoid that ignoble fate! Can you understand, Lord of the Mountain? I despise this body of vermin, I hate the fact that I am the only one who rots, I curse all those vermin who know not how blessed they are to have proper, human bodies!"::

54010::$$$message_0468_0049_0001$$$::The white mask gazes down at the oozing, festering old man.[lr]::
54011::$$$message_0468_0049_0002$$$::He has made very clear how much he despises humans living peaceful lives.[lr]::
54012::$$$message_0468_0049_0003$$$::He has recounted how his very effort to escape that peace has caused him great suffering.[lr]::
54013::$$$message_0468_0049_0004$$$::The mage is the cause of his own pain, of his perpetual state of decomposition melting his skin, festering his meat, and sundering his bones as long as he lives.::
54014::$$$message_0468_0050_0000$$$::However, his suffering has become a problem too great to be resolved by merely assigning blame.[lr]::
54015::$$$message_0468_0050_0001$$$::Morality and causality are no longer relevant.[lr]::
54016::$$$message_0468_0050_0002$$$::At any rate, one can speculate that Zouken Matou has long lost sight of his goal.::
54017::$$$message_0468_0051_0000$$$::An ordinary man could not withstand the pain and terror of Zouken's bodily decay for even an hour.[lr]::
54018::$$$message_0468_0051_0001$$$::No, it would not be possible no matter how stout one's spirit.[lr]::
54019::$$$message_0468_0051_0002$$$::One would die first.[lr]::
54020::$$$message_0468_0051_0003$$$::After a mere hour of decay, the body would die.[lr]::
54021::$$$message_0468_0051_0004$$$::Now, imagine two hundred years of this ordeal.[lr]::
54022::$$$message_0468_0051_0005$$$::Only the old mage could possibly know how much a human mind would deteriorate after so many years of endless decay.::
54023::$$$message_0468_0052_0000$$$::Zouken Matou abandoned his humanity long ago.[lr]::
54024::$$$message_0468_0052_0001$$$::Even if he were still sane, one could conclude that he had lost his way from the moment his mentality became incomprehensible to any human on earth.::
54025::$$$message_0468_0053_0000$$$::"A flawed conviction, pursued for centuries. I cannot hope to comprehend it, but..."[lr]::
54026::$$$message_0468_0053_0001$$$::The old mage's ramblings can be summed up in a single sentence: ::
54027::$$$message_0468_0054_0000$$$::    I don't want to die.[lr]::
54028::$$$message_0468_0054_0001$$$::    I don't want to die.[lr]::
54029::$$$message_0468_0054_0002$$$::    This man simply does not wish to die.::
54030::$$$message_0468_0055_0000$$$::That alone describes how clear an idea Zouken has of an otherwise vague conviction that any other man might have.[lr]::
54031::$$$message_0468_0055_0001$$$::In clinging to that simple, foolish wish, he has sacrificed a great many people.[lr]::
54032::$$$message_0468_0055_0002$$$::In sowing seeds to help him acquire the Holy Grail, he has created even more victims.::
54033::$$$message_0468_0056_0000$$$::No...[lr]::
54034::$$$message_0468_0056_0001$$$::The old mage's very existence is founded on the sacrifice of others.[lr]::
54035::$$$message_0468_0056_0002$$$::And to the masked Assassin, that is a motivation worthy of his service.::
54036::$$$message_0468_0057_0000$$$::"I cannot hope to comprehend it, but...you are worthy to be my Master, Lord Mage.[lr]::
54037::$$$message_0468_0057_0001$$$::Very well. Let us seek eternity together, as fellows never treated as human."::
54038::$$$message_0468_0058_0000$$$::The skull will serve.[lr]::
54039::$$$message_0468_0058_0001$$$::His bleached white head dips in respect to the rotting old mage.::
