46676::$$$message_0413_0000_0000$$$::It is daybreak.[lr]::
46677::$$$message_0413_0000_0001$$$::The knight in red is leaning against the pillar and staring at his own arm.[lr]::
46678::$$$message_0413_0000_0002$$$::He puts strength into his fingertips and clenches his fist.[lr]::
46679::$$$message_0413_0000_0003$$$::Only about half of his sensations are left.[lr]::
46680::$$$message_0413_0000_0004$$$::Even though he is a Heroic Spirit, he cannot maintain his existence without a Master that helps him stay in this world.[lr]::
46681::$$$message_0413_0000_0005$$$::Archer is existing because of a special ability that his class holds, but that is nearing its limit.::
46682::$$$message_0413_0001_0000$$$::The knight in red's remaining strength is less than a tenth of his original powers.[lr]::
46683::$$$message_0413_0001_0001$$$::His fists lack strength, and he should slowly start fading if he lets his guard down.::
46684::$$$message_0413_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46685::$$$message_0413_0002_0001$$$::But there is no problem.[lr]::
46686::$$$message_0413_0002_0002$$$::Even if he only has a tenth of his powers remaining, it is enough to finish Shirou Emiya off.[lr]::
46687::$$$message_0413_0002_0003$$$::Considering the difference in their abilities, this is not even a handicap.[lr]::
46688::$$$message_0413_0002_0004$$$::Therefore, it will end once they fight.[lr]::
46689::$$$message_0413_0002_0005$$$::His one and only objective will be accomplished here.::
46690::$$$message_0413_0003_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46691::$$$message_0413_0003_0001$$$::...That is right.[lr]::
46692::$$$message_0413_0003_0002$$$::He has been waiting for this moment.[lr]::
46693::$$$message_0413_0003_0003$$$::He has endured the endless repetition, hoping for this chance.[lr]::
46694::$$$message_0413_0003_0004$$$::He could only wait for a miracle that would not usually be able to occur, with a possibility close to zero.::
46695::$$$message_0413_0004_0000$$$::And his wish is granted.[lr]::
46696::$$$message_0413_0004_0001$$$::No, it is about to be granted.[lr]::
46697::$$$message_0413_0004_0002$$$::...He does not care about what awaits him afterwards.[lr]::
46698::$$$message_0413_0004_0003$$$::He will kill his own self with his own hands.[lr]::
46699::$$$message_0413_0004_0004$$$::That wish, which doesn't have enough of a future to be hope, is what kept him going after he wore out.::
46700::$$$message_0413_0005_0000$$$::"...Was it long? Or was it an instant?"[lr]::
46701::$$$message_0413_0005_0001$$$::He is an existence that disappears after each summoning to start with.[lr]::
46702::$$$message_0413_0005_0002$$$::His memory does not remain intact, whether he repeats that cycle 100 times or 1000 times.[lr]::
46703::$$$message_0413_0005_0003$$$::It only stays in his body as knowledge.[lr]::
46704::$$$message_0413_0005_0004$$$::Heroic Spirits know about other Heroic Spirits because they have accumulated knowledge.::
46705::$$$message_0413_0006_0000$$$::It is just like a book.[lr]::
46706::$$$message_0413_0006_0001$$$::Every time they are summoned, the book with its history is sent to its home.[lr]::
46707::$$$message_0413_0006_0002$$$::They remain in the house and read the books that are sent.[lr]::
46708::$$$message_0413_0006_0003$$$::What is troubling is that the one at the house does not know when those books are sent.::
46709::$$$message_0413_0007_0000$$$::The past or future does not matter.[lr]::
46710::$$$message_0413_0007_0001$$$::All the "books" are already in his room.[lr]::
46711::$$$message_0413_0007_0002$$$::His only way of measuring time is to read the records of his "cleaning" that he will carry out.::
46712::$$$message_0413_0008_0000$$$::It makes no difference whether it's an eternity or an instant.[lr]::
46713::$$$message_0413_0008_0001$$$::An eternity is an instant, and an instant is an eternity.[lr]::
46714::$$$message_0413_0008_0002$$$::Therefore, he does not know how rare this miracle is.[lr]::
46715::$$$message_0413_0008_0003$$$::He doesn't know whether it was the first time or a thousandth time he was summoned since he gained this hope.[lr]::
46716::$$$message_0413_0008_0004$$$::...All he has is this unordered knowledge.[lr]::
46717::$$$message_0413_0008_0005$$$::The future, past, and present are all things that Heroic Spirits don't have.::
46718::$$$message_0413_0009_0000$$$::"...A visitor, eh? I chose this place since I was told there would be no interruptions here."[lr]::
46719::$$$message_0413_0009_0001$$$::The knight in red suddenly gets up.[lr]::
46720::$$$message_0413_0009_0002$$$::Did his ears hear an intruder?[lr]::
46721::$$$message_0413_0009_0003$$$::Footsteps echo through the castle that should be silent.::
46722::$$$message_0413_0010_0000$$$::"...Wow. I'm surprised, Tohsaka. I was skeptical, but you're actually here."[lr]::
46723::$$$message_0413_0010_0001$$$::The voice echoes.[lr]::
46724::$$$message_0413_0010_0002$$$::The boy who entered rudely is Shinji Matou.::
46725::$$$message_0413_0011_0000$$$::"Hey now... No funny business, Archer.[lr]::
46726::$$$message_0413_0011_0001$$$::I have no business with you. You don't have any business with Tohsaka either, right? Then isn't it meaningless for us to fight here?"[lr]::
46727::$$$message_0413_0011_0002$$$::Shinji Matou walks over with light steps.[lr]::
46728::$$$message_0413_0011_0003$$$::He is looking at Rin Tohsaka who is tied to a chair.[lr]::
46729::$$$message_0413_0011_0004$$$::The girl doesn't say anything and stares at the intruder, while being tied up.[lr]::
46730::$$$message_0413_0011_0005$$$::That must make him pleased.[lr]::
46731::$$$message_0413_0011_0006$$$::Shinji Matou licks his lips in satisfaction and walks to the girl.::
46732::$$$message_0413_0012_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46733::$$$message_0413_0012_0001$$$::"What?"[lr]::
46734::$$$message_0413_0012_0002$$$::Shinji Matou glances in annoyance at the knight, who is staring down at him in silence.[lr]::
46735::$$$message_0413_0012_0003$$$::"What, you wanna fight? Are you serious? You'd be no match for me!"[lr]::
46736::$$$message_0413_0012_0004$$$::Shinji Matou smiles and returns to the entrance.::
46737::$$$message_0413_0013_0000$$$::There stands the golden haired boy... The eighth Servant, Gilgamesh.[lr]::
46738::$$$message_0413_0013_0001$$$::He himself is a disaster.[lr]::
46739::$$$message_0413_0013_0002$$$::The golden Servant looks at the knight with cool eyes.[lr]::
46740::$$$message_0413_0013_0003$$$::    But within them...[lr]::
46741::$$$message_0413_0013_0004$$$::The red eyes distorted from his smile only have the intention to murder the enemy in front of him.::
46742::$$$message_0413_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46743::$$$message_0413_0014_0001$$$::The knight in red is still silent.[lr]::
46744::$$$message_0413_0014_0002$$$::It makes no difference whether Shinji Matou appears or the strongest Servant in front of him is ready to attack him.[lr]::
46745::$$$message_0413_0014_0003$$$::The knight calmly stares at the uninvited enemies.::
46746::$$$message_0413_0015_0000$$$::"Haha, you're scared, right, Archer? It's fine, nothing to be ashamed of. He's the Servant who killed Berserker without difficulty. It's natural for you to be scar[line2]"[lr]::
46747::$$$message_0413_0015_0001$$$::"...Do you want Rin, Shinji Matou?"[lr]::
46748::$$$message_0413_0015_0002$$$::"Huh...? Y-yeah, of course. There's no other reason for me to come close to this castle."::
46749::$$$message_0413_0016_0000$$$::"I see. Then wait until things are over. I will give her to you once I get rid of Shirou Emiya.[lr]::
46750::$$$message_0413_0016_0001$$$::She is mine until then. It cannot be helped if you cannot compromise on that... It is regrettable, but you will die here, Gilgamesh."[lr]::
46751::$$$message_0413_0016_0002$$$::The knight in red declares, still staring at the golden Servant.::
46752::$$$message_0413_0017_0000$$$::"Very funny, fool."[lr]::
46753::$$$message_0413_0017_0001$$$::Was that statement itself good enough reason for the man to kill Archer?[lr]::
46754::$$$message_0413_0017_0002$$$::The golden Servant identifies the knight in red in front of him as a target he must kill.::
46755::$$$message_0413_0018_0000$$$::"Wait, Gilgamesh. Don't be rash, let's be smart. Come on, he's saying he'll give her to me, so I'll let him.[lr]::
46756::$$$message_0413_0018_0001$$$::Archer doesn't have a Master. I'm sure there's no Master who would form a contract with him after how many times he betrayed people, so he'll disappear if we let him be. I can take Tohsaka after that."::
46757::$$$message_0413_0019_0000$$$::Shinji Matou stares at the red knight, still smiling.[lr]::
46758::$$$message_0413_0019_0001$$$::His eyes look as if he's enjoying the fate of one who is about to disappear soon. ::
46759::$$$message_0413_0020_0000$$$::"How smart, Shinji Matou. That decision is accurate. In that regard, you are most suitable as a Master."[lr]::
46760::$$$message_0413_0020_0001$$$::"Oh, you show promise! What a waste, I would've formed a contract with you had you come to me!"[lr]::
46761::$$$message_0413_0020_0002$$$::Stepping away from the knight in red, Shinji Matou claps his hands happily.::
46762::$$$message_0413_0021_0000$$$::"But I'm sorry, I don't need any more Servants. It's unfortunate, but you'll have to disappear here."[lr]::
46763::$$$message_0413_0021_0001$$$::"You do not need to tell me. So what will you do? Will you fight me, or wait until I disappear?"::
46764::$$$message_0413_0022_0000$$$::"Yeah, I'll wait. We'll protect Tohsaka until you get rid of Emiya.[lr]::
46765::$$$message_0413_0022_0001$$$::But, that's right. In that case, that thing is mine already, right? Then don't you think I can do anything to her now?"::
46766::$$$message_0413_0023_0000$$$::He looks at the knight in red and Rin Tohsaka with snake-like eyes.[lr]::
46767::$$$message_0413_0023_0001$$$::Those words test the loyalty of the knight in red.[lr]::
46768::$$$message_0413_0023_0002$$$::To that...[lr]::
46769::$$$message_0413_0023_0003$$$::"...The agreement with Shirou Emiya was that she will not be harmed, but that will disappear by dawn. You can do as you wish once the time comes."[lr]::
46770::$$$message_0413_0023_0004$$$::The knight in red answers in an emotionless voice.::
46771::$$$message_0413_0024_0000$$$::"Ha... Haha, ahahahahahahahahahahaha!"[lr]::
46772::$$$message_0413_0024_0001$$$::Did you hear that, Tohsaka? Your Servant is selling off his Master!"[lr]::
46773::$$$message_0413_0024_0002$$$::Sneering laughter echoes through the dingy room.[lr]::
46774::$$$message_0413_0024_0003$$$::The red knight leaves the room, as if he has no interest.::
46775::$$$message_0413_0025_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46776::$$$message_0413_0025_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
46777::$$$message_0413_0025_0002$$$::He passes by Gilgamesh.[lr]::
46778::$$$message_0413_0025_0003$$$::He goes into the hallway, ignoring the red eyes that look at him, amused.[lr]::
46779::$$$message_0413_0025_0004$$$::At that moment...::
46780::$$$message_0413_0026_0000$$$::"...Faker."[lr]::
46781::$$$message_0413_0026_0001$$$::The King of Heroes says, mocking him.jú>h
