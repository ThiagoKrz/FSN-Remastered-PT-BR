10422::$$$message_0106_0000_0000$$$::I'll go on the offensive.[lr]::
10423::$$$message_0106_0000_0001$$$::There's a Master at Ryudou Temple, and I need to stop them from sucking up magical energy from everyone in town as soon as possible.::
10424::$$$message_0106_0001_0000$$$::"I agree with Saber. I'm not thrilled to be the one making the move here, but it depends on the opponent, too.[lr]::
10425::$$$message_0106_0001_0001$$$::If we want to find out what sort of Master we're dealing with, we should go to Ryudou Temple as soon as possible."::
10426::$$$message_0106_0002_0000$$$::"Then it is time to head out, Shirou. I am very glad to see you be so proactive."[lr]::
10427::$$$message_0106_0002_0001$$$::"Fine. There's nothing I can do or say since you've already decided, but just be careful."::
10428::$$$message_0106_0003_0000$$$::"Tohsaka?"[lr]::
10429::$$$message_0106_0003_0001$$$::"I'm going to rest. I have no interest in a battle I can't win. If you aren't back tomorrow, I'll at least go collect your remains, in the spirit of our alliance."::
10430::$$$message_0106_0004_0000$$$::"What the hell? Why would she say something so ominous?"[lr]::
10431::$$$message_0106_0004_0001$$$::"That is likely Rin's way of warning us.[lr]::
10432::$$$message_0106_0004_0002$$$::We are certain to face defenses meant to ward off intruders into Ryudou Temple. We will need to pass through the enemy traps and beat the Master, the lord of this stronghold."[lr]::
10433::$$$message_0106_0004_0003$$$::"Mm. Well, you're right, but..."::
10434::$$$message_0106_0005_0000$$$::I'm not so enthusiastic and confident that I think I'm going to go in there and beat the Master.[lr]::
10435::$$$message_0106_0005_0001$$$::I just want to learn their identity and motives.[lr]::
10436::$$$message_0106_0005_0002$$$::If all goes well, we might be able to avoid battle, and if things get hairy, we can retreat.::
10437::$$$message_0106_0006_0000$$$::I won't ever let her suffer or look so pained again.[lr]::
10438::$$$message_0106_0006_0001$$$::We'll just have to retreat right away if it starts to look too dangerous.::
10439::$$$message_0106_0007_0000$$$::The clouds zip by overhead.[lr]::
10440::$$$message_0106_0007_0001$$$::Must be a strong wind up there.::
10441::$$$message_0106_0008_0000$$$::"Master. It is almost midnight."[lr]::
10442::$$$message_0106_0008_0001$$$::"Yeah. The town's gone to sleep, so it's a good time to head out."::
10443::$$$message_0106_0009_0000$$$::I nod as I grab my shinai bag.[lr]::
10444::$$$message_0106_0009_0001$$$::Inside, I've packed a bamboo sword I found in the shed.[lr]::
10445::$$$message_0106_0009_0002$$$::It's not the greatest weapon for going up against a Servant, but as long as my strengthening magecraft works, I should be able to survive at least one attack.::
10446::$$$message_0106_0010_0000$$$::"Saber. We're only going to Ryudou Temple just to check things out.[lr]::
10447::$$$message_0106_0010_0001$$$::We're going to see who the Master is, and what class their Servant is. We're not here to start a fight."::
10448::$$$message_0106_0011_0000$$$::"...Understood. But if the enemy desires a fight, or if I determine you are in danger, I will not hold back.[lr]::
10449::$$$message_0106_0011_0001$$$::As long as we are heading into enemy territory, please prepare yourself for the possibility of death."::
10450::$$$message_0106_0012_0000$$$::The possibility of death...[lr]::
10451::$$$message_0106_0012_0001$$$::The scales of fate weigh on one end the Master at Ryudou Temple, and on the other, us, the intruders.[lr]::
10452::$$$message_0106_0012_0002$$$::The scales are balanced right now, but they may tip one way or the other tonight.::
10453::$$$message_0106_0013_0000$$$::We head west from the intersection, and hurry along the empty road.[lr]::
10454::$$$message_0106_0013_0001$$$::Ryudou Temple is located at the end of the gently sloping mountain path opposite the more developed Shinto.::
10455::$$$message_0106_0014_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
10456::$$$message_0106_0014_0001$$$::There's a long set of stairs.[lr]::
10457::$$$message_0106_0014_0002$$$::The road that leads up to one of the tallest mountains in Fuyuki is all but swallowed up in an ominous darkness.::
10458::$$$message_0106_0015_0000$$$::"Saber...[lr]::
10459::$$$message_0106_0015_0001$$$::Do you sense any Servants around?"[lr]::
10460::$$$message_0106_0015_0002$$$::"Yes. I cannot be certain of anything specific, but I can definitely sense a  Servant."[lr]::
10461::$$$message_0106_0015_0003$$$::Saber's detection abilities seem to be weakened, probably by the Bounded Field set up over Ryudou Temple.::
10462::$$$message_0106_0016_0000$$$::"...It is an ill-favored wind tonight. Shirou, do not leave my side, even for a moment."[lr]::
10463::$$$message_0106_0016_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
10464::$$$message_0106_0016_0002$$$::I just nod in answer, then start up the stone stairs.::
10465::$$$message_0106_0017_0000$$$::The air feels tense.[lr]::
10466::$$$message_0106_0017_0001$$$::Shrouded in the dark of night, the forest echoes with soft rustling sounds.[lr]::
10467::$$$message_0106_0017_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
10468::$$$message_0106_0017_0003$$$::With every step I take, worry gnaws at my stomach.::
10469::$$$message_0106_0018_0000$$$::The temple gate finally comes into view.[lr]::
10470::$$$message_0106_0018_0001$$$::Nothing's happened so far.[lr]::
10471::$$$message_0106_0018_0002$$$::There's no sign of the enemy, and the temple gates are wide open, as if inviting us inside.::
10472::$$$message_0106_0019_0000$$$::"Shirou. Stop."[lr]::
10473::$$$message_0106_0019_0001$$$::"Huh? Is it an enemy, Saber?"[lr]::
10474::$$$message_0106_0019_0002$$$::"Yes. But it is not a Servant. Their presence is too weak. It is likely a familiar tasked to surveillance. We can ignore it, but..."::
10475::$$$message_0106_0020_0000$$$::There must be something about that surveillance familiar that makes her hesitate.[lr]::
10476::$$$message_0106_0020_0001$$$::Saber frowns, then glares at the temple gates just a few steps ahead of us.::
10477::$$$message_0106_0021_0000$$$::"Saber? Is something bothering you?"[lr]::
10478::$$$message_0106_0021_0001$$$::"I do not know. I cannot tell if I am feeling this chill because of the familiar, or if it is whatever is protecting this temple gate.[lr]::
10479::$$$message_0106_0021_0002$$$::There seems to be a gatekeeper of some sort, but they appear to be absent at the moment.[lr]::
10480::$$$message_0106_0021_0003$$$::I do not want to admit it, but it seems we are lucky, that I am...fortunate not to have to confront whoever is protecting this gate."::
10481::$$$message_0106_0022_0000$$$::"So there's a gatekeeper, but they're not here right now?"[lr]::
10482::$$$message_0106_0022_0001$$$::"Yes. They already know we are here.[lr]::
10483::$$$message_0106_0022_0002$$$::There could be only two reasons the gatekeeper has been pulled back. Do you know what those reasons might be, Shirou?"::
10484::$$$message_0106_0023_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
10485::$$$message_0106_0023_0001$$$::...The gatekeeper was either pulled back to hide from us, or they're going to let us through the gates but don't intend to let us leave.[lr]::
10486::$$$message_0106_0023_0002$$$::...Either way, we're not going to accomplish anything unless we get inside.::
10487::$$$message_0106_0024_0000$$$::"It's a trap, Saber. Can you tell what's going on in there?"[lr]::
10488::$$$message_0106_0024_0001$$$::"No. All I can say is that I can sense the presence of a Servant."::
10489::$$$message_0106_0025_0000$$$::"...Got it. I guess we won't be learning anything unless we go inside."[lr]::
10490::$$$message_0106_0025_0001$$$::Saber nods.::
10491::$$$message_0106_0026_0000$$$::"Let's go. Whatever they do to us, we're not getting anything out of this trip until we see our opponents' faces." [lr]::
10492::$$$message_0106_0026_0001$$$::Saber and I approach the temple gate.::
10493::$$$message_0106_0027_0000$$$::For a brief moment, the clouds drift across the moon, swallowing up its light.[lr]::
10494::$$$message_0106_0027_0001$$$::Our vision falls into darkness.[lr]::
10495::$$$message_0106_0027_0002$$$::"...Eh?"[lr]::
10496::$$$message_0106_0027_0003$$$::In the darkness, I thought I saw a beautiful snake slithering between the trees.::
10497::$$$message_0106_0028_0000$$$::"...Wait, Saber. I thought I just..."[lr]::
10498::$$$message_0106_0028_0001$$$::I stop Saber, who's trying to walk through the temple gate.[lr]::
10499::$$$message_0106_0028_0002$$$::"Shirou?"[lr]::
10500::$$$message_0106_0028_0003$$$::Her golden hair whips around.[lr]::
10501::$$$message_0106_0028_0004$$$::But suddenly...::
10502::$$$message_0106_0029_0000$$$::"Forced transportation!? But that's impossible! There's no such thing as transference magecraft in this age[line2]ah, but Caster...!"[lr]::
10503::$$$message_0106_0029_0001$$$::Saber's figure distorts.[lr]::
10504::$$$message_0106_0029_0002$$$::What kind of magecraft is this?[lr]::
10505::$$$message_0106_0029_0003$$$::Saber becomes distorted like a mirage, and[line2]::
10506::$$$message_0106_0029_0004$$$::"This is bad! Pull back, Saber! Your body's fading...!"[lr]::
10507::$$$message_0106_0029_0005$$$::"No, Shirou! You are the one who is being transported...! Hurry...take my hand...!"[lr]::
10508::$$$message_0106_0029_0006$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
10509::$$$message_0106_0029_0007$$$::T-transport!? L-like teleportation!?::
10510::$$$message_0106_0029_0008$$$::"Shirou, reach out! You're being pulled i[line2]"[lr]::
10511::$$$message_0106_0029_0009$$$::Saber kicks the ground and grabs hold of my arm.[lr]::
10512::$$$message_0106_0029_0010$$$::But then...[lr]::
10513::$$$message_0106_0029_0011$$$::"Kn...ungh!?"[lr]::
10514::$$$message_0106_0029_0012$$$::The dark figure of a Servant cuts in from the side.::
10515::$$$message_0106_0029_0013$$$::"You let your guard down, Saber. Your resistance to magecraft has backfired.[lr]::
10516::$$$message_0106_0029_0014$$$::If you weren't so powerful, you would have been able to protect him."::
10517::$$$message_0106_0029_0015$$$::"Wha... You are...a Servant!"::
10518::$$$message_0106_0029_0016$$$::Black and silver figures clash.[lr]::
10519::$$$message_0106_0029_0017$$$::Saber versus Rider.[lr]::
10520::$$$message_0106_0029_0018$$$::The two confront one another at the top of the stone steps.[lr]::
10521::$$$message_0106_0029_0019$$$::"Wha... Saber. SABER!!!"[lr]::
10522::$$$message_0106_0029_0020$$$::I feel myself pulled through dimensions, twisted out of mine and through others, then deposited back into reality.::
10523::$$$message_0106_0029_0021$$$::"Ah...ur, argh...!"[lr]::
10524::$$$message_0106_0029_0022$$$::My blood flows [font italic=true]backward[font italic=false].[lr]::
10525::$$$message_0106_0029_0023$$$::For a moment, my organs flip inside out, and I'm overwhelmed by nausea...::
10526::$$$message_0106_0030_0000$$$::"Oh my. I meant to hook a dragon, but I seem to have caught something much smaller in my net."[lr]::
10527::$$$message_0106_0030_0001$$$::"What...!?"[lr]::
10528::$$$message_0106_0030_0002$$$::I turn around to face whatever is behind me.::
10529::$$$message_0106_0031_0000$$$::"Gh...ahck!"[lr]::
10530::$$$message_0106_0031_0001$$$::I don't have time to figure out who it is.[lr]::
10531::$$$message_0106_0031_0002$$$::I swing the wooden sword behind me, not even taking it out of the shinai bag.::
10532::$$$message_0106_0032_0000$$$::"[aero]"[lr]::
10533::$$$message_0106_0032_0001$$$::"Ah...!"[lr]::
10534::$$$message_0106_0032_0002$$$::I'm blown away.[lr]::
10535::$$$message_0106_0032_0003$$$::Something strikes the side of my chest, and my body sinks into a watery surface.::
10536::$$$message_0106_0033_0000$$$::"Huh...what the...?"[lr]::
10537::$$$message_0106_0033_0001$$$::The liquid turns red.[lr]::
10538::$$$message_0106_0033_0002$$$::My body...the whole right side of my chest is gone.::
10539::$$$message_0106_0034_0000$$$::"What a stupid boy. You walked into my temple equipped with barely anything in the way of magic resistance... It appears Saber was not blessed with a proper Master."::
10540::$$$message_0106_0035_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
10541::$$$message_0106_0035_0001$$$::The purple-robed figure snickers.[lr]::
10542::$$$message_0106_0035_0002$$$::I'm dizzy... I need to get up and take Saber's hand, but I'm shaky and my body...::
10543::$$$message_0106_0036_0000$$$::"Worried about Saber? Don't. I'll take Saber. I need her Noble Phantasm to defeat Berserker. You'll die here and now, but she will live on as my slave."::
10544::$$$message_0106_0037_0000$$$::"...ah...rgh...!"[lr]::
10545::$$$message_0106_0037_0001$$$::I don't have any strength in me.[lr]::
10546::$$$message_0106_0037_0002$$$::My...fingers...[lr]::
10547::$$$message_0106_0037_0003$$$::They're cold as ice. My consciousness fades...into darkness and...mud...::
10548::$$$message_0106_0038_0000$$$::"Goodbye, boy. You're not even worth keeping as a slave, weak as you are. But I will take your Command Spells and use them far better than you ever would have."::
10549::$$$message_0106_0039_0000$$$::A crooked blade glints in the darkness and begins cutting out my Command Spells.[lr]::
10550::$$$message_0106_0039_0001$$$::I'm in black, murky water.[lr]::
10551::$$$message_0106_0039_0002$$$::The only thing my motionless eyes see is the clouds swallowing up the moon.::
