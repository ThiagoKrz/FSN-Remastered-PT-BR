38815::$$$message_0331_0000_0000$$$::       I'm dreaming.::
38816::$$$message_0331_0001_0000$$$::Using a thin connected circuit like a blood vessel, I see a memory I can't reach.::
38817::$$$message_0331_0002_0000$$$::This was his memory.[lr]::
38818::$$$message_0331_0002_0001$$$::At least, it isn't mine.[lr]::
38819::$$$message_0331_0002_0002$$$::This is someone else's story.[lr]::
38820::$$$message_0331_0002_0003$$$::It's so long ago that he doesn't think about it.[lr]::
38821::$$$message_0331_0002_0004$$$::A memory so distant that he doesn't even try to recall it.[lr]::
38822::$$$message_0331_0002_0005$$$::A memory so old that he can't even remember it.[lr]::
38823::$$$message_0331_0002_0006$$$::   They are...[lr]::
38824::$$$message_0331_0002_0007$$$::The heavy shackles of a contract, set in stone, unable to be changed or retracted.::
38825::$$$message_0331_0003_0000$$$::It's not like he wanted anything.[lr]::
38826::$$$message_0331_0003_0001$$$::Rather, he was the type of person who could not stand many things.[lr]::
38827::$$$message_0331_0003_0002$$$::He could not stand if there was someone crying near him.[lr]::
38828::$$$message_0331_0003_0003$$$::He could not stand if there was someone hurt near him.[lr]::
38829::$$$message_0331_0003_0004$$$::He could not stand if there was someone dying near him.[lr]::
38830::$$$message_0331_0003_0005$$$::That was the only reason.[lr]::
38831::$$$message_0331_0003_0006$$$::And for only that reason, he tried to save everyone within view.::
38832::$$$message_0331_0004_0000$$$::He was so clumsy that it would make you nervous watching him.[lr]::
38833::$$$message_0331_0004_0001$$$::But he would accomplish it in the end and change many a fate.[lr]::
38834::$$$message_0331_0004_0002$$$::To that end, his life was full of blessedness.[lr]::
38835::$$$message_0331_0004_0003$$$::The awkward, inelegant battles he fought had meaning.[lr]::
38836::$$$message_0331_0004_0004$$$::For as much as he was hurt and stared down death, he was equally able to save people.::
38837::$$$message_0331_0005_0000$$$::...But, there was one pitfall there.[lr]::
38838::$$$message_0331_0005_0001$$$::Everyone within view.[lr]::
38839::$$$message_0331_0005_0002$$$::Yet you cannot wholly look upon yourself.[lr]::
38840::$$$message_0331_0005_0003$$$::So in the end...[lr]::
38841::$$$message_0331_0005_0004$$$::He was not able to save the most important person of all, himself.::
38842::$$$message_0331_0006_0000$$$::   I don't know how it ended up like that.[lr]::
38843::$$$message_0331_0006_0001$$$::No, it should be the other way around.[lr]::
38844::$$$message_0331_0006_0002$$$::It was a wonder it didn't end up like that sooner.[lr]::
38845::$$$message_0331_0006_0003$$$::And so, there was a terrible disaster.[lr]::
38846::$$$message_0331_0006_0004$$$::Many people died, and many more faced death.[lr]::
38847::$$$message_0331_0006_0005$$$::There was nothing he alone could do.[lr]::
38848::$$$message_0331_0006_0006$$$::With so many deaths an inevitability before him...::
38849::$$$message_0331_0007_0000$$$::"Let me make a contract. I shall give you my life after death. I would take compensation now."::
38850::$$$message_0331_0008_0000$$$::Yes, he made a contract with a mysterious thing known as the World.[lr]::
38851::$$$message_0331_0008_0001$$$::    Throwing away himself to save all those living here.[lr]::
38852::$$$message_0331_0008_0002$$$::The birth of a hero.::
38853::$$$message_0331_0009_0000$$$::That's it.[lr]::
38854::$$$message_0331_0009_0001$$$::There's nothing after that.[lr]::
38855::$$$message_0331_0009_0002$$$::Even if he is called a hero, it doesn't change what he does.[lr]::
38856::$$$message_0331_0009_0003$$$::From the start, his objective wasn't to become a hero.[lr]::
38857::$$$message_0331_0009_0004$$$::He merely needed a hero's power as part of the process.::
38858::$$$message_0331_0010_0000$$$::Even then, his ending came quickly.[lr]::
38859::$$$message_0331_0010_0001$$$::A savior is nothing but a nuisance to those who are not saved.::
38860::$$$message_0331_0011_0000$$$::He understands his own powers and the extent of the world.[lr]::
38861::$$$message_0331_0011_0001$$$::He accepts there are those that he can and cannot save.[lr]::
38862::$$$message_0331_0011_0002$$$::And so he wanted those within sight to be happy, at least.[lr]::
38863::$$$message_0331_0011_0003$$$::Others becried it as hypocrisy. [lr]::
38864::$$$message_0331_0011_0004$$$::There were many who despised him for his narrow-mindedness.[lr]::
38865::$$$message_0331_0011_0005$$$::Even then, the way that he silently pursued his ideals was something he should've been proud of.::
38866::$$$message_0331_0012_0000$$$::But in the end...[lr]::
38867::$$$message_0331_0012_0001$$$::He faced an uncompensated death, as per the contract.::
38868::$$$message_0331_0013_0000$$$::   And in the end, he reached that place.::
38869::$$$message_0331_0014_0000$$$::He had friends and a lover.[lr]::
38870::$$$message_0331_0014_0001$$$::But cornered by his ideal, he lost it all.::
38871::$$$message_0331_0015_0000$$$::With no place to go...[lr]::
38872::$$$message_0331_0015_0001$$$::Carrying the voices of resentment with him, he continued to fight.[lr]::
38873::$$$message_0331_0015_0002$$$::He knew of his fate heading towards death, but he used that to try to perform the miracles that were beyond his capacity.::
38874::$$$message_0331_0016_0000$$$::...But, that comes to an end.[lr]::
38875::$$$message_0331_0016_0001$$$::He arrives at the hill of swords.[lr]::
38876::$$$message_0331_0016_0002$$$::The end of his battle came on a mound with rusted, ownerless blades.::
38877::$$$message_0331_0017_0000$$$::   Alone after all.[lr]::
38878::$$$message_0331_0017_0001$$$::Even then, there was nothing to regret if he was able to save everyone within view.[lr]::
38879::$$$message_0331_0017_0002$$$::He smiles with satisfaction and lets go of the sword.(—õ³
