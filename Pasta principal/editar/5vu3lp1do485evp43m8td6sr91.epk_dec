61140::$$$message_0559_0000_0001$$$::"Thanks for the meal."[lr]::
61141::$$$message_0559_0000_0002$$$::We mutually thank our cook.[lr]::
61142::$$$message_0559_0000_0003$$$::"I'm glad you both enjoyed it. You really ate everything down to the last speck."::
61143::$$$message_0559_0001_0000$$$::Sakura starts cleaning up.[lr]::
61144::$$$message_0559_0001_0001$$$::On the dining table are a clay pot, three bowls, and all the garnishes you would need for udon.::
61145::$$$message_0559_0002_0000$$$::"Oh, let me clean up. My fever's better, so it's the least I can do."[lr]::
61146::$$$message_0559_0002_0001$$$::"Really? Then I'll ask you to help a little to see how much you've recovered. I can wash the dishes, so please bring the dirty dishes over and clean up around the table."::
61147::$$$message_0559_0003_0000$$$::Sakura puts on her apron and moves to the kitchen.[lr]::
61148::$$$message_0559_0003_0001$$$::I'll bring the clay pot and bowls over, then.::
61149::$$$message_0559_0004_0000$$$::"Shirou, are you feeling all right? You said your fever has improved, but you still don't look well."[lr]::
61150::$$$message_0559_0004_0001$$$::"Huh? Am I still pale?"::
61151::$$$message_0559_0005_0000$$$::"...Hm. Not quite pale, but unwell.[lr]::
61152::$$$message_0559_0005_0001$$$::Your magical energy, which could be said to be your lifeline as a Master[line2]as a mage[line2]is still lacking. I don't recall the battle last night placing an undue burden on you, but the enemy might have placed some contrivance to drain your energy in the temple grounds."::
61153::$$$message_0559_0006_0000$$$::"Hmm..."[lr]::
61154::$$$message_0559_0006_0001$$$::Now that she mentions it, Ryudou Temple did feel off, somehow.[lr]::
61155::$$$message_0559_0006_0002$$$::All the people inside were weakened, so maybe Caster set up a Bounded Field to drain life energy from humans inside.::
61156::$$$message_0559_0007_0000$$$::"I'm feeling better now, so it's no problem. My magical energy will come back if I get nutrition. My energy capacity isn't much to sneeze at anyway, so I'm sure it'll fill back up once I eat dinner."::
61157::$$$message_0559_0008_0000$$$::"You know yourself best, so I won't press the issue if you say so. Sakura is right, though. You do take your own condition too lightly."[lr]::
61158::$$$message_0559_0008_0001$$$::Saber stacks the three bowls while saying that.::
61159::$$$message_0559_0009_0000$$$::"I just need to give these to Sakura, yes? I'll also carry the pot, so please clean the table, Shirou."[lr]::
61160::$$$message_0559_0009_0001$$$::She heads to the kitchen without waiting for my reply.::
61161::$$$message_0559_0010_0000$$$::"Sakura, should I put the bowls here?"[lr]::
61162::$$$message_0559_0010_0001$$$::"Oh, Saber? Yes, you can set the dirty dishes down there."[lr]::
61163::$$$message_0559_0010_0002$$$::"I see. Also, lunch was delicious. I must thank you again."[lr]::
61164::$$$message_0559_0010_0003$$$::"Ahaha, I still have a lot to learn. Senpai's the one who's really good at making porridge and udon noodles."::
61165::$$$message_0559_0011_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
61166::$$$message_0559_0011_0001$$$::I hear a cheerful conversation from the kitchen.[lr]::
61167::$$$message_0559_0011_0002$$$::"Hey, those two get along pretty well after all."[lr]::
61168::$$$message_0559_0011_0003$$$::Maybe they hit it off when they were cleaning up after breakfast.[lr]::
61169::$$$message_0559_0011_0004$$$::Anyway, it's good to see them get along.::
61170::$$$message_0559_0012_0000$$$::"Guess I'll make some afternoon tea, then."[lr]::
61171::$$$message_0559_0012_0001$$$::I place a small teapot and tea leaves on the table.[lr]::
61172::$$$message_0559_0012_0002$$$::It's almost one o'clock.[lr]::
61173::$$$message_0559_0012_0003$$$::It's the perfect time for an after-lunch break. I...[lr]::pZ
