69036::$$$message_0631_0000_0001$$$::I need to figure out exactly what's wrong with me, or I won't be able to act.[lr]::
69037::$$$message_0631_0000_0002$$$::I'm still conscious.[lr]::
69038::$$$message_0631_0000_0003$$$::As long as I don't space out, I can be aware of my situation, like I have been so far.::
69039::$$$message_0631_0001_0000$$$::"...Wait, what am I doing here, again?"[lr]::
69040::$$$message_0631_0001_0001$$$::I wonder why I'm in the shed.[lr]::
69041::$$$message_0631_0001_0002$$$::Sakura's warning.[lr]::
69042::$$$message_0631_0001_0003$$$::Sakura told us to run. Tohsaka said that she'd fight.[lr]::
69043::$$$message_0631_0001_0004$$$::And, and then...oh yeah, we have to go to a cavern under Ryudou Temple.::
69044::$$$message_0631_0002_0000$$$::"So what am I doing on the floor of the shed when we're going to Ryudou Temple?"[lr]::
69045::$$$message_0631_0002_0001$$$::I've fallen on the ground.[lr]::
69046::$$$message_0631_0002_0002$$$::When I came to, I was sprawled out in the shed.[lr]::
69047::$$$message_0631_0002_0003$$$::My right arm throbs in pain.[lr]::
69048::$$$message_0631_0002_0004$$$::Thanks to that, I'm fully awake.::
69049::$$$message_0631_0003_0000$$$::"...Dammit. Get it together, dumbass."[lr]::
69050::$$$message_0631_0003_0001$$$::I stand up and check the feeling in my arms and legs.[lr]::
69051::$$$message_0631_0003_0002$$$::...I don't feel so good.[lr]::
69052::$$$message_0631_0003_0003$$$::I'm losing something at alarming speed.[lr]::
69053::$$$message_0631_0003_0004$$$::It isn't critical.[lr]::
69054::$$$message_0631_0003_0005$$$::I should be able to fight like I have so far until morning, at least.::
69055::$$$message_0631_0004_0000$$$::"You look awful. Do you recognize me, Shirou?"::
69056::$$$message_0631_0005_0000$$$::"...!"[lr]::
69057::$$$message_0631_0005_0001$$$::I gasp and whirl around.[lr]::
69058::$$$message_0631_0005_0002$$$::Deep within the shed, where the moonlight doesn't reach,[lr]::
69059::$$$message_0631_0005_0003$$$::a black-clothed Servant stands in the dark.::
69060::$$$message_0631_0006_0000$$$::"Rider. Have you been here this whole..."::
69061::$$$message_0631_0007_0000$$$::"Yes. I have been monitoring you.[lr]::
69062::$$$message_0631_0007_0001$$$::My orders are to protect Shirou Emiya, but Sakura is my Master. If you threaten her, I cannot protect you.[lr]::
69063::$$$message_0631_0007_0002$$$::That is why I didn't help you in the forest. It is your own doing that you were chased by Berserker."::
69064::$$$message_0631_0008_0000$$$::Rider coolly explains.[lr]::
69065::$$$message_0631_0008_0001$$$::She's very businesslike.[lr]::
69066::$$$message_0631_0008_0002$$$::It seems that she was waiting for me to be alone.::
69067::$$$message_0631_0009_0000$$$::"...Oh. So you're here now..."[lr]::
69068::$$$message_0631_0009_0001$$$::"To kill you. You are Sakura's enemies. I cannot let you go to her."[lr]::
69069::$$$message_0631_0009_0002$$$::Rider is holding her stake-shaped daggers.[lr]::
69070::$$$message_0631_0009_0003$$$::She inches closer, her murderous intent clear.::
69071::$$$message_0631_0010_0000$$$::"...Ngh."[lr]::
69072::$$$message_0631_0010_0001$$$::Rider's serious.[lr]::
69073::$$$message_0631_0010_0002$$$::I...[lr]::
