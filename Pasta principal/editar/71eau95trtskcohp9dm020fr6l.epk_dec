16607::$$$message_0151_0000_0000$$$::...Okay. It looks like the enemy's gone.::
16608::$$$message_0151_0000_0001$$$::...Ugh, my head... There's a bite mark on my head...::
16609::$$$message_0151_0000_0002$$$::Uh...let's get ourselves together...[lr]::
16610::$$$message_0151_0000_0003$$$::Life is like a little bypass that leads straight to the bottom of the valley...::
16611::$$$message_0151_0000_0004$$$::Let's start Tiger Dojo, the rescue segment that saves Shirou...whose chances of coming back to this world are getting slimmer all the time.::
16612::$$$message_0151_0000_0005$$$::Okay. But Taiga, this dead end isn't that different from the last one.::
16613::$$$message_0151_0000_0006$$$::Saber went berserk and stabbed Shirou again.::
16614::$$$message_0151_0000_0007$$$::You're right. But it's slightly different, since this dead end could have been avoided if Shirou had tried a little harder. I don't think it's all Saber's fault.::
16615::$$$message_0151_0000_0008$$$::Oh. Now that you mention it, Saber's not here.::
16616::$$$message_0151_0000_0009$$$::Hm. I guess she doesn't get as broken up about it if it's only half her fault.[lr]::
16617::$$$message_0151_0000_0010$$$::And so, we can operate Tiger Dojo without having to worry this time.::
16618::$$$message_0151_0000_0011$$$::Yeah, but there's actually not much to say.::
16619::$$$message_0151_0000_0012$$$::The choices won't really be subtle anymore either. The story's approaching its climax, so you won't get a good ending if you don't shape up.::
16620::$$$message_0151_0000_0013$$$::If you can just defeat Caster, there'll only be one enemy left.[lr]::
16621::$$$message_0151_0000_0014$$$::Win! Don't let your guard down! A crisis offers opportunity! Buck up and fight! Ma'am, yes, ma'am!::
16622::$$$message_0151_0000_0015$$$::Okay, well done.[lr]::
16623::$$$message_0151_0000_0016$$$::Well, see you next time at the next Tiger Dojo!::
16624::$$$message_0151_0000_0017$$$::Okay! See you, Shirou!::
