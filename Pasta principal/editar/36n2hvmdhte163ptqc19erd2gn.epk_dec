42259::$$$message_0368_0000_0000$$$::The sun is setting, and the lobby slowly wrapped in darkness.[lr]::
42260::$$$message_0368_0000_0001$$$::...We came to the castle to find an ally, but the only thing remaining is the ruins of a castle after a turn of events.::
42261::$$$message_0368_0001_0000$$$::"So, what should we do? I think we can stay here and strengthen our defense, without attacking.[lr]::
42262::$$$message_0368_0001_0001$$$::We have food and can stay warm here. If we fix the walls, we can manage to protect ourselves in the castle."::
42263::$$$message_0368_0002_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42264::$$$message_0368_0002_0001$$$::That's the best thing to do if we want to protect ourselves.[lr]::
42265::$$$message_0368_0002_0002$$$::But we even gained an ally to choose the path to fight because we couldn't do so.::
42266::$$$message_0368_0003_0000$$$::"...No, it would be meaningless even if we strengthened our defense.[lr]::
42267::$$$message_0368_0003_0001$$$:: Any defense would be broken once Caster completely controls Saber.[lr]::
42268::$$$message_0368_0003_0002$$$:: ...Even if we do survive here, if the Holy Grail becomes Caster's, then..."::
42269::$$$message_0368_0004_0000$$$::"Not only us, but the people in town will suffer as well.[lr]::
42270::$$$message_0368_0004_0001$$$::...Then there's only one thing to do. We'll get Saber back before Caster fully controls her. We have to defeat Caster, Archer, Assassin, and Mr. Kuzuki by ourselves."::
42271::$$$message_0368_0005_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42272::$$$message_0368_0005_0001$$$::I nod silently.[lr]::
42273::$$$message_0368_0005_0002$$$:: Since we couldn't get the help of Illya, we have to do this by ourselves.[lr]::
42274::$$$message_0368_0005_0003$$$::...The sun will completely set soon.[lr]::
42275::$$$message_0368_0005_0004$$$:: We'll have to get out of this place before that and attack Caster before Saber surrenders...::
42276::$$$message_0368_0006_0000$$$::   It's a simple plan.[lr]::
42277::$$$message_0368_0006_0001$$$::The process will change depending on the situation. Our only objective is to confront Caster as a result.::
42278::$$$message_0368_0007_0000$$$::It doesn't matter whether that situation is only for an instant.[lr]::
42279::$$$message_0368_0007_0001$$$::Caster is the weakest Servant when it comes to hand-to-hand combat.[lr]::
42280::$$$message_0368_0007_0002$$$::Even if she may be a Servant, we have a chance at winning if we can fight her two against one.[lr]::
42281::$$$message_0368_0007_0003$$$::Tohsaka's gems and my Projection magecraft.[lr]::
42282::$$$message_0368_0007_0004$$$::It's not a battle we can't win if we make full use of our individual powers. ::
42283::$$$message_0368_0008_0000$$$::That was the conclusion that we reached, and we go out of the forest believing in that.[lr]::
42284::$$$message_0368_0008_0001$$$::We don't exchange words after that.[lr]::
42285::$$$message_0368_0008_0002$$$::...There's one reason.[lr]::
42286::$$$message_0368_0008_0003$$$::We're desperately bluffing so that we can deceive ourselves.::
42287::$$$message_0368_0009_0000$$$::The sunrise is gray.[lr]::
42288::$$$message_0368_0009_0001$$$::The sunlight is blocked by the clouds, obscuring the light of dawn.[lr]::
42289::$$$message_0368_0009_0002$$$::A cloudy sky is above us.[lr]::
42290::$$$message_0368_0009_0003$$$::The sky that is closer to gray than black reminds me of that time ten years ago.::
42291::$$$message_0368_0010_0000$$$::   Is it going to start raining soon?[lr]::
42292::$$$message_0368_0010_0001$$$::A dull white sky.[lr]::
42293::$$$message_0368_0010_0002$$$::That man was standing under the cloudy sky that smelled like it had just stopped raining.::
42294::$$$message_0368_0011_0000$$$::"So you did come. I know your personality. I thought you would come back with some kind of strategy."[lr]::
42295::$$$message_0368_0011_0001$$$::He stares at Tohsaka with cool eyes.::
42296::$$$message_0368_0012_0000$$$::"I'm sorry, Archer. I can't live up to those expectations.[lr]::
42297::$$$message_0368_0012_0001$$$::As you can see, we're empty-handed. We brainstormed a whole day, but we couldn't come up with any plan."::
42298::$$$message_0368_0013_0000$$$::"...What?"[lr]::
42299::$$$message_0368_0013_0001$$$::"You might not believe me, but we came here to die an honorable death.[lr]::
42300::$$$message_0368_0013_0002$$$::...But, it looks like we have a bit of luck left. If you're here, that means Saber is still going against Caster."::
42301::$$$message_0368_0014_0000$$$::Then, there are four opponents.[lr]::
42302::$$$message_0368_0014_0001$$$:: If we break through Archer, the gatekeeper, we can fight Caster and Assassin head-on.[lr]::
42303::$$$message_0368_0014_0002$$$:: Our plan is that we break through Archer together and confront Caster with the two of us.[lr]::
42304::$$$message_0368_0014_0003$$$::...That's the lie Tohsaka made up.::
42305::$$$message_0368_0015_0000$$$:: "...I see. Caster and Shirou Emiya. The scale tipped to Caster, huh, Rin?"[lr]::
42306::$$$message_0368_0015_0001$$$::Archer's oppressive question.::
42307::$$$message_0368_0016_0000$$$::"Yes. I hate my own personality, but I guess I can't change it since I'm born with it. I'm inhuman when it counts most after all." [lr]::
42308::$$$message_0368_0016_0001$$$::Tohsaka answers with an emotionless voice and steps forward.::
42309::$$$message_0368_0017_0000$$$::"...Shirou. Archer will only attack you. I won't back you up. I'll fight Caster while you get killed."[lr]::
42310::$$$message_0368_0017_0001$$$::As if that's a crime...[lr]::
42311::$$$message_0368_0017_0002$$$::Tohsaka apologizes with her back, as if she was intending to use me as a sacrifice from the start.::
42312::$$$message_0368_0018_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
42313::$$$message_0368_0018_0001$$$::How stupid of her.[lr]::
42314::$$$message_0368_0018_0002$$$::She didn't have to say such a thing.::
42315::$$$message_0368_0019_0000$$$::"Don't worry about it, idiot. I also know your personality."[lr]::
42316::$$$message_0368_0019_0001$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
42317::$$$message_0368_0019_0002$$$::"Tohsaka, it's your principle not to do anything that you don't have a chance of winning at, right? That's why I knew. ...This is certainly the only way we can win."::
42318::$$$message_0368_0020_0000$$$::"...Shirou."[lr]::
42319::$$$message_0368_0020_0001$$$::Her back that didn't have any hesitation shakes slightly.[lr]::
42320::$$$message_0368_0020_0002$$$::[font italic=true]...Oh.[font italic=false][lr]::
42321::$$$message_0368_0020_0003$$$::That's all the apology I need.::
42322::$$$message_0368_0021_0000$$$::"Go. I'll hold Archer down. I'll hold him down, even if it's with will, at least until you get inside the church."[lr]::
42323::$$$message_0368_0021_0001$$$::I control my breathing and turn the gears of my engine.[lr]::
42324::$$$message_0368_0021_0002$$$::   My condition is better than ever.[lr]::
42325::$$$message_0368_0021_0003$$$::I can project the same swords as him right away in this state.::
42326::$$$message_0368_0022_0000$$$::"...Thanks. Sorry, Shirou."[lr]::
42327::$$$message_0368_0022_0001$$$::Tohsaka runs.[lr]::
42328::$$$message_0368_0022_0002$$$::...Archer lets her go as if she was not in his sight from the start.[lr]::
42329::$$$message_0368_0022_0003$$$::"Well done. It seems like you understand your powers, even while being incompetent."[lr]::
42330::$$$message_0368_0022_0004$$$::He emits the intent to kill, as if to say he won't let me go this time.::
42331::$$$message_0368_0023_0000$$$::"Trace, on."[lr]::
42332::$$$message_0368_0023_0001$$$::...I project the twin swords.[lr]::
42333::$$$message_0368_0023_0002$$$::The match should be made in an instant.[lr]::
42334::$$$message_0368_0023_0003$$$::The only things in my sight are Archer and Tohsaka's back running to the church.::
42335::$$$message_0368_0024_0000$$$::...Was it over in one blow, or was I able to hold out a few times?[lr]::
42336::$$$message_0368_0024_0001$$$::The battle ends, and I look up at the sky with a limp body.[lr]::
42337::$$$message_0368_0024_0002$$$::A gray color covers the sky.[lr]::
42338::$$$message_0368_0024_0003$$$::It should start raining soon.[lr]::
42339::$$$message_0368_0024_0004$$$::The cloudy sky is close, and the clouds block my hands like a wall.::
42340::$$$message_0368_0025_0000$$$::"...Tohsaka, please, be safe..."[lr]::
42341::$$$message_0368_0025_0001$$$::My body is burning.[lr]::
42342::$$$message_0368_0025_0002$$$::I hear the faint sound of flames from the church.::
42343::$$$message_0368_0026_0000$$$::"...Haah, agh."[lr]::
42344::$$$message_0368_0026_0001$$$::The sun is too far away from my powerlessly extended hand.[lr]::
42345::$$$message_0368_0026_0002$$$::That sky was as if I went back in time to ten years ago.::
