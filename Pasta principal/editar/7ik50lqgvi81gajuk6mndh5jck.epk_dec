23628::$$$message_0208_0000_0000$$$::We make our way through the town after dark.[lr]::
23629::$$$message_0208_0000_0001$$$::It's a little past eight.[lr]::
23630::$$$message_0208_0000_0002$$$::The station is at its most crowded hour, and Saber and I stare at the map of the town.::
23631::$$$message_0208_0001_0000$$$::"We have checked most of the main buildings around this area. Is there anywhere else we can go?"[lr]::
23632::$$$message_0208_0001_0001$$$::"Let's see. There's a factory a little further out from here. We should probably go check it out since people gather there. Not that factories are exactly Shinji's style."::
23633::$$$message_0208_0002_0000$$$::...We do make conversation now, but it's still hard for me to look Saber in the eye.[lr]::
23634::$$$message_0208_0002_0001$$$::I think our conversation from earlier is still stuck in my head.[lr]::
23635::$$$message_0208_0002_0002$$$::Saber's acting like it didn't happen, which bothers me even more.::
23636::$$$message_0208_0003_0000$$$::"What about you, Saber? Can you sense Rider's presence?"[lr]::
23637::$$$message_0208_0003_0001$$$::"...No, I cannot. I fought her once, so I should be able to sense her."::
23638::$$$message_0208_0004_0000$$$::An odd feeling prickles my skin.[lr]::
23639::$$$message_0208_0004_0001$$$::Even I can feel the wave of magical energy that washes over us.[lr]::
23640::$$$message_0208_0004_0002$$$::There is no way that Saber can't.::
23641::$$$message_0208_0005_0000$$$::"Shirou. I do not believe I need to tell you, but..."[lr]::
23642::$$$message_0208_0005_0001$$$::"I know. Are they close, Saber?"[lr]::
23643::$$$message_0208_0005_0002$$$::"No. They are not close enough, but we are most definitely being watched. This wave of magical energy is likely an attempt to provoke us."::
23644::$$$message_0208_0006_0000$$$::If we're being watched...that means they've fallen into our trap.[lr]::
23645::$$$message_0208_0006_0001$$$::Releasing so much magical energy is an obvious attempt to lure us out.::
23646::$$$message_0208_0007_0000$$$::"So...is this Rider?"[lr]::
23647::$$$message_0208_0007_0001$$$::My mind changes gears.[lr]::
23648::$$$message_0208_0007_0002$$$::The awkwardness between Saber and me earlier disappears.::
23649::$$$message_0208_0008_0000$$$::"I will track the source of magical energy. Please be careful, Master."[lr]::
23650::$$$message_0208_0008_0001$$$::I nod.[lr]::
23651::$$$message_0208_0008_0002$$$::The wave of bloodlust I feel stinging at my skin is coming from the direction of the office district as it slowly empties of people.::
23652::$$$message_0208_0009_0000$$$::Today, of all days, maybe there'll be nobody working overtime.[lr]::
23653::$$$message_0208_0009_0001$$$::Most of the lights in the windows of the building seen as the heart of Shinto are dark.::
23654::$$$message_0208_0010_0000$$$::There aren't many people on the sidewalks, and we have a pretty clear view of the building.[lr]::
23655::$$$message_0208_0010_0001$$$::I don't see anyone suspicious. If Shinji's anywhere, he'll be up ahead... Maybe in the park we just left.::
23656::$$$message_0208_0011_0000$$$::I feel the bloodlust growing more intense.[lr]::
23657::$$$message_0208_0011_0001$$$::The enemy's nearby.[lr]::
23658::$$$message_0208_0011_0002$$$::Or more like...[lr]::
23659::$$$message_0208_0011_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
23660::$$$message_0208_0011_0004$$$::A chill runs up my spine.[lr]::
23661::$$$message_0208_0011_0005$$$::If even I can feel this aura of bloodlust, then we're probably already in enemy territory.::
23662::$$$message_0208_0012_0000$$$::"Saber, be careful. Something's not right."[lr]::
23663::$$$message_0208_0012_0001$$$::"You are correct. I do not believe they would attack us with so many others present, but it is difficult to be certain with this foe. It is best to be cautious."::
23664::$$$message_0208_0013_0000$$$::We both nod in silent agreement and make our way toward the park.[lr]::
23665::$$$message_0208_0013_0001$$$::It's probably best to ignore the oppressive sense of a knife being pressed to my throat.[lr]::
23666::$$$message_0208_0013_0002$$$::Shinji and Rider are nowhere around the office district.[lr]::
23667::$$$message_0208_0013_0003$$$::If they're going to attack, it's probably going to be somewhere in the park, where there won't be anyone else around...::
23668::$$$message_0208_0014_0000$$$::"Shirou...!"[lr]::
23669::$$$message_0208_0014_0001$$$::"Saber?"::
23670::$$$message_0208_0015_0000$$$::I turn towards Saber.[lr]::
23671::$$$message_0208_0015_0001$$$::She rushes towards me like a bolt of lightning.[lr]::
23672::$$$message_0208_0015_0002$$$::And blocks a blow aimed straight at my head.::
23673::$$$message_0208_0016_0000$$$::"Gh[line2]!?"[lr]::
23674::$$$message_0208_0016_0001$$$::I look up.[lr]::
23675::$$$message_0208_0016_0002$$$::A massive building towers overhead.[lr]::
23676::$$$message_0208_0016_0003$$$::Clinging to the side of that building like some kind of spider...is Rider.::
23677::$$$message_0208_0016_0004$$$::"Wha...?"[lr]::
23678::$$$message_0208_0016_0005$$$::Her hair is long enough to cover her entire body, her limbs supple and white.[lr]::
23679::$$$message_0208_0016_0006$$$::The masked woman is indeed our enemy...Rider!!!::
23680::$$$message_0208_0016_0007$$$::"...Fh."[lr]::
23681::$$$message_0208_0016_0008$$$::She licks her lips as she stares down at me.[lr]::
23682::$$$message_0208_0016_0009$$$::The hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.[lr]::
23683::$$$message_0208_0016_0010$$$::There's no mistaking it.[lr]::
23684::$$$message_0208_0016_0011$$$::She came spiraling down from the top of the building, aiming to take my head in a sneak attack from our blind spot.::
23685::$$$message_0208_0016_0012$$$::Saber lands on the ground.[lr]::
23686::$$$message_0208_0016_0013$$$::In the time it took for her to rush in to block Rider's attack, Saber summoned her armor.::
23687::$$$message_0208_0017_0000$$$::"Saber, she's...!"[lr]::
23688::$$$message_0208_0017_0001$$$::"I will go after her! Please stay here, Shirou!"[lr]::
23689::$$$message_0208_0017_0002$$$::"Eh!? Go after her? How!?"[lr]::
23690::$$$message_0208_0017_0003$$$::Saber kicks off from the ground.[lr]::
23691::$$$message_0208_0017_0004$$$::She disappears into the sky with a glint of silvery armor.::
23692::$$$message_0208_0018_0000$$$::"Wha...!?"[lr]::
23693::$$$message_0208_0018_0001$$$::Rider clinging to the side of the building like that is absurd enough, but Saber leaping skyward in pursuit of her is just outright ridiculous.::
23694::$$$message_0208_0019_0000$$$::No. They're Servants. Normal logic doesn't apply here.[lr]::
23695::$$$message_0208_0019_0001$$$::Like Rider, Saber moves along the side of the building, striking at her with dizzying speed!::
23696::$$$message_0208_0020_0000$$$::The two shadows clash and cross against each other.[lr]::
23697::$$$message_0208_0020_0001$$$::The sight of the two of them fighting overhead, darting along the building as they climb into the air, is like watching two fighter jets.[lr]::
23698::$$$message_0208_0020_0002$$$::All the while, I...[lr]::
