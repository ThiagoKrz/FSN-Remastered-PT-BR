49523::$$$message_0427_0000_0000$$$::I cut the cod with gusto.[lr]::
49524::$$$message_0427_0000_0001$$$::The Napa cabbage is cut and I've grated a ton of daikon radish.[lr]::
49525::$$$message_0427_0000_0002$$$::"...All right. All I have to do is put the ingredients in and put it on the stove..."::
49526::$$$message_0427_0001_0000$$$::The pot boils.[lr]::
49527::$$$message_0427_0001_0001$$$::It's an easy meal to make, mostly dependent on making the stock.[lr]::
49528::$$$message_0427_0001_0002$$$::That went well, so all that's left is to prepare the number of plates needed.::
49529::$$$message_0427_0002_0000$$$::"I'm home! Man, it's so cold, it started snowing."[lr]::
49530::$$$message_0427_0002_0001$$$::Fuji-nee comes home.[lr]::
49531::$$$message_0427_0002_0002$$$::"Welcome back. It's snowing outside?"::
49532::$$$message_0427_0003_0000$$$::"Yeah. It looks light, but it feels like it's gonna pile up. Wow, we're having hot pot for dinner? As always, you know how to hit the mark. Mm, I'm in a good mood, so maybe I'll drink tonight."[lr]::
49533::$$$message_0427_0003_0001$$$::Fuji-nee goes inside the living room, saying dangerous sounding things.::
49534::$$$message_0427_0004_0000$$$::"Hello, Ms. Fujimura."[lr]::
49535::$$$message_0427_0004_0001$$$::"Oh, it's Tohsaka. What's going on? It's rare to see you here."::
49536::$$$message_0427_0005_0000$$$::...?[lr]::
49537::$$$message_0427_0005_0001$$$::Fuji-nee naturally accepts Tohsaka's greeting.[lr]::
49538::$$$message_0427_0005_0002$$$::She hums as she goes past the living room and into the kitchen.::
49539::$$$message_0427_0006_0000$$$::"Wow, that's good cod. They say that eating cod while watching snowfall is the best, so it must go with sake even better."::
49540::$$$message_0427_0007_0000$$$::Fuji-nee opens the refrigerator.[lr]::
49541::$$$message_0427_0007_0001$$$::And...[lr]::
49542::$$$message_0427_0007_0002$$$::After retrieving her favorite Baumkuchen and taking a bite...::
49543::$$$message_0427_0008_0000$$$::"WAIT, WHY IS TOHSAKA AT SHIROU'S PLACEEE!!!???"::
49544::$$$message_0427_0009_0000$$$::"Hey, Tohsaka! It's not 'hello,' what are you doing here at this time!?"[lr]::
49545::$$$message_0427_0009_0001$$$::Fuji-nee stuffs the Baumkuchen down and marches into the living room.::
49546::$$$message_0427_0010_0000$$$::"Emiya is treating me to dinner. As for you, aren't you lacking a bit of common courtesy to come in without even ringing the doorbell?"[lr]::
49547::$$$message_0427_0010_0001$$$::In response, the Tohsaka army calmly makes her counterattack.::
49548::$$$message_0427_0011_0000$$$::"W-well... I-I am the supervisor of this household![lr]::
49549::$$$message_0427_0011_0001$$$::Shi[line2]Emiya's father put me in charge here, so I'm like family!"::
49550::$$$message_0427_0012_0000$$$::"I see. Then allow me to make a formal greeting.[lr]::
49551::$$$message_0427_0012_0001$$$::Hello, Ms. Fujimura. I have been spending the whole day here. I will continue to study for an exam with Emiya after dinner, but please do not mind us."::
49552::$$$message_0427_0013_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]Shiro... I mean, Emiya! What is this!? Since when did you decide to hold a study session with Tohsaka!?"::
49553::$$$message_0427_0014_0000$$$::"Ms. Fujimura? Please do not push yourself if it is hard to address him that way.[lr]::
49554::$$$message_0427_0014_0001$$$::It does not concern me whether how you call Emiya. Whether you call him by his first name or by a nickname, I respect people's privacy." ::
49555::$$$message_0427_0015_0000$$$::"Uuuh... Tohsaka, did you hear from Sakura...?"[lr]::
49556::$$$message_0427_0015_0001$$$::"Who knows? Unfortunately, it would be improper to say what I've discussed with Miss Matou, since I must respect her privacy. But, I wish it is as you imagine."::
49557::$$$message_0427_0016_0000$$$::Fuji-nee falters at Tohsaka's smile.[lr]::
49558::$$$message_0427_0016_0001$$$::...I understand how Fuji-nee feels well.[lr]::
49559::$$$message_0427_0016_0002$$$::When she smiles like that, it makes you feel overwhelmed and cornered...::
49560::$$$message_0427_0017_0000$$$::"...I guess the match has been decided. I'll just leave them be."[lr]::
49561::$$$message_0427_0017_0001$$$::Actually, it wasn't even a match to begin with.[lr]::
49562::$$$message_0427_0017_0002$$$::It's only a matter of time until Tohsaka talks Fuji-nee down.[lr]::
49563::$$$message_0427_0017_0003$$$::I'll let Tohsaka take care of it and focus on preparing dinner.::
49564::$$$message_0427_0018_0000$$$::It stops snowing outside once we finish the pot.[lr]::
49565::$$$message_0427_0018_0001$$$::It only snowed for about two hours, so I bet there's only a bit of snow left in the yard.::
49566::$$$message_0427_0019_0000$$$::"Shirou, I put the dishes in the sink."[lr]::
49567::$$$message_0427_0019_0001$$$::"Oh, thanks. I'll go wash them real quick."[lr]::
49568::$$$message_0427_0019_0002$$$::I get up and head to the kitchen.::
49569::$$$message_0427_0020_0000$$$::"The dishes? Should I wash them? It doesn't seem fair if I'm the only one getting treated."[lr]::
49570::$$$message_0427_0020_0001$$$::Tohsaka and Fuji-nee switch spots.[lr]::
49571::$$$message_0427_0020_0002$$$::The offer is nice, but I can't let a guest do the dishes.::
49572::$$$message_0427_0021_0000$$$::"It's fine, you'll just owe me one. You should rest since you just ate. And Fuji-nee, you go prepare the bath."[lr]::
49573::$$$message_0427_0021_0001$$$::"Yeah yeah, I know."[lr]::
49574::$$$message_0427_0021_0002$$$::It must be because she's full now, as Fuji-nee is compliant.[lr]::
49575::$$$message_0427_0021_0003$$$::Everything would be so much easier if she were like this all the time. Though I suppose it'd also be boring.::
49576::$$$message_0427_0022_0000$$$::"Oh."[lr]::
49577::$$$message_0427_0022_0001$$$::I dropped another plate.[lr]::
49578::$$$message_0427_0022_0002$$$::It's been twenty minutes since I started doing the dishes. This is the second plate I dropped.::
49579::$$$message_0427_0023_0000$$$::"...Mrgh."[lr]::
49580::$$$message_0427_0023_0001$$$::There's no excuse even if my left hand is numb. I'm really dropping the proverbial ball if I'm being a klutz just from this.::
49581::$$$message_0427_0024_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
49582::$$$message_0427_0024_0001$$$::If I'm being honest with myself, I should stop until my arm no longer feels this way, but I quickly shake that thought off.::
49583::$$$message_0427_0025_0000$$$::I roll up my sleeve and continue washing the dishes.[lr]::
49584::$$$message_0427_0025_0001$$$::If this were from something else I could maybe excuse it, but I refuse over something coming from me.[lr]::
49585::$$$message_0427_0025_0002$$$::There's no way I'm going to lose to myself. I refuse to admit defeat.::
49586::$$$message_0427_0026_0000$$$::"Mrgh..."[lr]::
49587::$$$message_0427_0026_0001$$$::And as a result, the damage taken increases.[lr]::
49588::$$$message_0427_0026_0002$$$::This is the third plate now.[lr]::
49589::$$$message_0427_0026_0003$$$::Fortunately, it didn't break since I put a bath towel on the floor after I dropped the first one.::
49590::$$$message_0427_0027_0000$$$::So it shouldn't be a problem, but...[lr]::
49591::$$$message_0427_0027_0001$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
49592::$$$message_0427_0027_0002$$$::It's really awkward feeling Tohsaka's eyes on me whenever I drop a plate.::
49593::$$$message_0427_0028_0000$$$::"...Ms. Fujimura. Is Emiya always like that?"[lr]::
49594::$$$message_0427_0028_0001$$$::I hear Tohsaka's voice from the living room.::
49595::$$$message_0427_0029_0000$$$::"Don't be ridiculous. Shirou has never broken a plate before. He must be nervous since you're here."[lr]::
49596::$$$message_0427_0029_0001$$$::BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ENEMY.[lr]::
49597::$$$message_0427_0029_0002$$$::Leave it to Fuji-nee to hit a bullseye on the dig.::
49598::$$$message_0427_0030_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
49599::$$$message_0427_0030_0001$$$::Tohsaka ignores that and stares at me.::
49600::$$$message_0427_0031_0000$$$::"..."[lr]::
49601::$$$message_0427_0031_0001$$$::...This is hard.[lr]::
49602::$$$message_0427_0031_0002$$$::Half of my body is already numb, so it distracts me when she watches me that earnestly... Oh, shoot.::
49603::$$$message_0427_0032_0000$$$::"Ugh, damn it."[lr]::
49604::$$$message_0427_0032_0001$$$::I click my tongue and look down at the broken plate.[lr]::
49605::$$$message_0427_0032_0002$$$::This is the fourth one now. I could see it coming, but my left hand didn't move fast enough.[lr]::
49606::$$$message_0427_0032_0003$$$::"..."[lr]::
49607::$$$message_0427_0032_0004$$$::I slowly look behind me.::
49608::$$$message_0427_0033_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
49609::$$$message_0427_0033_0001$$$::...She's watching me.[lr]::
49610::$$$message_0427_0033_0002$$$::Tohsaka scrutinizes me from her place at the table.::
49611::$$$message_0427_0034_0000$$$::Then...[lr]::
49612::$$$message_0427_0034_0001$$$::She suddenly gets up and walks over to me.::
49613::$$$message_0427_0035_0000$$$::"Emiya. I'll do it, so you go and rest."[lr]::
49614::$$$message_0427_0035_0001$$$::"But[line2]"[lr]::
49615::$$$message_0427_0035_0002$$$::"Be careful not to step on the broken plates. I can figure out where to put what, so you can go drink some tea."[lr]::
49616::$$$message_0427_0035_0003$$$::Tohsaka rolls up her sleeves and stands by the sink.::
49617::$$$message_0427_0036_0000$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
49618::$$$message_0427_0036_0001$$$::...I don't think I can do anything about this.[lr]::
49619::$$$message_0427_0036_0002$$$::It's a herculean task to stop Tohsaka once she makes up her mind, and to be honest...[lr]::
49620::$$$message_0427_0036_0003$$$::...It's frustrating, but there's something strangely picturesque about Tohsaka standing there doing something so mundane.::
49621::$$$message_0427_0037_0000$$$::Once I get out of the bath, Fuji-nee is the only one in the living room.[lr]::
49622::$$$message_0427_0037_0001$$$::Tohsaka's shoes are still at the entrance, and I assume Saber's in the dojo.[lr]::
49623::$$$message_0427_0037_0002$$$::It's almost 9 PM.[lr]::
49624::$$$message_0427_0037_0003$$$::Now...[lr]::)ø
