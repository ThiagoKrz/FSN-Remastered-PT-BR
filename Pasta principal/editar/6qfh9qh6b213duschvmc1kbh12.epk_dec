27109::$$$message_0232_0000_0000$$$::Okay, good work![lr]::
27110::$$$message_0232_0000_0001$$$::Congratulations for fully completing the main story and completely filling the Tiger Stamp sheet!::
27111::$$$message_0232_0000_0002$$$::Congratulations!::
27112::$$$message_0232_0000_0003$$$::Welcome to Tiger Dojo SP, a special place for those who have completed the really long main story and fully conquered the Tiger Stamps! ::
27113::$$$message_0232_0000_0004$$$::You've pretty much played through the entire game, so I really have nothing more to say.[lr]::
27114::$$$message_0232_0000_0005$$$::Yep. Now you can go wherever you want, sir!::
27115::$$$message_0232_0000_0006$$$::Yep. You can now say goodbye to button-mashing hell.[lr]::
27116::$$$message_0232_0000_0007$$$::Anyway, we're on a retreat at the Einzberns' secluded hot spring resort, Valhalla Hot Springs.::
27117::$$$message_0232_0000_0008$$$::What do you think, Taiga? How's the water temperature?::
27118::$$$message_0232_0000_0009$$$::So good. So relaxing.[lr]::
27119::$$$message_0232_0000_0010$$$::I feel like if I let myself relax too much, I'll head straight to heaven.::
27120::$$$message_0232_0000_0011$$$::Right? The benefits of this hot spring include relieving fatigue and sending souls off to the other side.[lr]::
27121::$$$message_0232_0000_0012$$$::If you let your guard down, there's no coming back.::
27122::$$$message_0232_0000_0013$$$::Huh!?[lr]::
27123::$$$message_0232_0000_0014$$$::I think I just saw a beautiful field of flowers...[lr]::
27124::$$$message_0232_0000_0015$$$::Whew, that was a close one. You shouldn't fall asleep in the bath.::
27125::$$$message_0232_0000_0016$$$::Anyway, the Tiger Dojo has reached its grand finale.[lr]::
27126::$$$message_0232_0000_0017$$$::To wrap up the story of [font italic=true]Fate[font italic=false], we're gonna hold a postmortem meeting to reflect on what we've done.::
27127::$$$message_0232_0000_0018$$$::Aww...I really don't want to get lectured at the very end.[lr]::
27128::$$$message_0232_0000_0019$$$::We're at a hot spring, so let's just stick to reminiscing.::
27129::$$$message_0232_0000_0020$$$::Huh!? Is a little girl admonishing me!?::
27130::$$$message_0232_0000_0021$$$::But you're right. The hot spring feels real nice, and it's the lion's job to hold a postmortem meeting.::
27131::$$$message_0232_0000_0022$$$::Yep. I'm reflecting on my own actions. I'm not gonna bother thinking anymore, so let's just look back at what we did.::
27132::$$$message_0232_0000_0023$$$::So, what was your favorite part of the main story, Illya?::
27133::$$$message_0232_0000_0024$$$::Me? Hmmm, I'd say the part where I was killed in the Rin Route. There originally wasn't a cutscene there, but they added one in later on.::
27134::$$$message_0232_0000_0025$$$::Oh, you mean the part where your heart got ripped out? Yeah, that made [font italic=true]my[font italic=false] heart skip a beat!::
27135::$$$message_0232_0000_0026$$$::Why don't you just hurry off to heaven![lr]::
27136::$$$message_0232_0000_0027$$$::I was talking about the cutscene with Berserker and me.::
27137::$$$message_0232_0000_0028$$$::By the way, the scene Taiga's talking about is the cutscene that was mysteriously made out of the blue, even though it was at the top of the list to cut out.::
27138::$$$message_0232_0000_0029$$$::O-oh, is that so?::
27139::$$$message_0232_0000_0030$$$::I don't get it. So the developers kept the cutscene that was in poor taste, but the scene where I transformed through the power of the Babylonian god and went toe to toe with Aŋra Mainiiu was cut? That doesn't make sense.::
27140::$$$message_0232_0000_0031$$$::Hey, Taiga. This may not really matter, but the hero that transforms using the god of Babylonia's power is a jaguar, not a tiger.::
27141::$$$message_0232_0000_0032$$$::Eh!? You're kidding. But the tiger cape had cute whiskers!::
27142::$$$message_0232_0000_0033$$$::If having whiskers makes you a tiger, then even certain mobile-suited warriors can be tigers.::
27143::$$$message_0232_0000_0034$$$::Whaaat!? This is as shocking as when I found out that sweet potatoes and yams are completely different foods!::
27144::$$$message_0232_0000_0035$$$::Huh... I've been wondering. Why are you so infatuated with tigers?::
27145::$$$message_0232_0000_0036$$$::You hate when people call you Tiger, but you wear tiger-striped clothes. Do you love or hate tigers?::
27146::$$$message_0232_0000_0037$$$::Hm. I both deeply hate and deeply love them at once.::
27147::$$$message_0232_0000_0038$$$::Well, whatever. Everyone has their own unique tastes, so I'm not going to delve deeper into that.[lr]::
27148::$$$message_0232_0000_0039$$$::So what about you? What was your favorite part of the main story, Taiga?::
27149::$$$message_0232_0000_0040$$$::Hmmm. Let's see. I like the opening movie.[lr]::
27150::$$$message_0232_0000_0041$$$::Especially the parts where Taiga Fujimura shows up.::
27151::$$$message_0232_0000_0042$$$::I was a fool for asking...[lr]::
27152::$$$message_0232_0000_0043$$$::We're not making any progress like this, so let's just go in order.::
27153::$$$message_0232_0000_0044$$$::Okay, let's take a look at part one, the Saber route.[lr]::
27154::$$$message_0232_0000_0045$$$::It's the route that represents the game [font italic=true]Fate[font italic=false]!::
27155::$$$message_0232_0000_0046$$$::I have no complaints about this route, since I play a big part in the story, and Taiga comes out at the end too.::
27156::$$$message_0232_0000_0047$$$::Yeah. I was still acting like one of the main heroines in that route. Time sure has been cruel to me. Fufu. I should kill the guy who wrote the story.::
27157::$$$message_0232_0000_0048$$$::Okay, okay, don't get so salty.[lr]::
27158::$$$message_0232_0000_0049$$$::The idea of the Saber route is to tell the story of the Holy Grail War, focusing on Saber.::
27159::$$$message_0232_0000_0050$$$::It's the classic story intended for beginner Masters.::
27160::$$$message_0232_0000_0051$$$::You were sort of a mid-boss too, Illya.[lr]::
27161::$$$message_0232_0000_0052$$$::Shirou had to say goodbye to Saber, but that should have made him grow into a more resilient man...::
27162::$$$message_0232_0000_0053$$$::...Huh? Wait a minute.[lr]::
27163::$$$message_0232_0000_0054$$$::Does that mean Shirou's at risk of becoming Archer on this route!? ::
27164::$$$message_0232_0000_0055$$$::Is that the big risk there!?::
27165::$$$message_0232_0000_0056$$$::That'll depend on how Shirou wants to live his life.[lr]::
27166::$$$message_0232_0000_0057$$$::Well, I don't think it's likely there. Besides, he has me by his side.::
27167::$$$message_0232_0000_0058$$$::I see. With a little devil like you by his side, Shirou is on the path of evil...::
27168::$$$message_0232_0000_0059$$$::Hey! Wait a minute![lr]::
27169::$$$message_0232_0000_0060$$$::Illya, would you be able to live that long?::
27170::$$$message_0232_0000_0061$$$::That's a secret.[lr]::
27171::$$$message_0232_0000_0062$$$::Besides, humans eventually die, so don't worry too much about that.::
27172::$$$message_0232_0000_0063$$$::Next up is the Rin route: [font italic=true]Unlimited Blade Works.[font italic=false]::
27173::$$$message_0232_0000_0064$$$::The story is more of an ensemble story, and it's more focused on the Servants.[r]::
27174::$$$message_0232_0000_0065$$$::And if I'm being really honest here...::
27175::$$$message_0232_0000_0066$$$::...we hardly play a part in that story.[lr]::
27176::$$$message_0232_0000_0067$$$::Illya dropped out midway, and I was treated real poorly...::
27177::$$$message_0232_0000_0068$$$::Your very existence is poor.::
27178::$$$message_0232_0000_0069$$$::Gah! The truth hurts!::
27179::$$$message_0232_0000_0070$$$::But Tohsaka hardly made a mark, considering she was the main heroine.::
27180::$$$message_0232_0000_0071$$$::Seems like Archer stole all her thunder.::
27181::$$$message_0232_0000_0072$$$::That can't be helped.[lr]::
27182::$$$message_0232_0000_0073$$$::As the title, [font italic=true]Unlimited Blade Works[font italic=false], suggests, Rin's route is also about Shirou.::
27183::$$$message_0232_0000_0074$$$::[font italic=true]Fate[font italic=false] and [font italic=true]Unlimited Blade Works[font italic=false] are two sides of the same coin.::
27184::$$$message_0232_0000_0075$$$::Shirou's the protagonist of this game, so the main story has to focus on him.::
27185::$$$message_0232_0000_0076$$$::He's a pretty complicated guy.::
27186::$$$message_0232_0000_0077$$$::I see.[lr]::
27187::$$$message_0232_0000_0078$$$::Which means the backbone of the game's theme is covered in Tohsaka's route.::
27188::$$$message_0232_0000_0079$$$::Exactly.[lr]::
27189::$$$message_0232_0000_0080$$$::So those two parts are the front story for [font italic=true]Fate[font italic=false]. It's the story in which you get to do everything you can as a Master.::
27190::$$$message_0232_0000_0081$$$::Next up is Sakura's route. The back side of the [font italic=true]Fate[font italic=false] story.[lr]::
27191::$$$message_0232_0000_0082$$$::It's a battle to the death from the beginning of the Holy Grail War to the very end!::
27192::$$$message_0232_0000_0083$$$::A battle to the death, huh? Yeah, Sakura's route really did have the most deaths.::
27193::$$$message_0232_0000_0084$$$::This route was supposed to be the shortest, but it ended up being the longest, and that's no joke!::
27194::$$$message_0232_0000_0085$$$::If only that route had been shorter, Illya and I could've had our routes!::
27195::$$$message_0232_0000_0086$$$::Your route wasn't even a thought during the brainstorming session.::
27196::$$$message_0232_0000_0087$$$::Anyway. Sakura's route was full of twists and turns. What did you think of it, Illya?[lr]::
27197::$$$message_0232_0000_0088$$$::Can we call this the grand finale?::
27198::$$$message_0232_0000_0089$$$::Of course you can. Something as crazy as the Greater Holy Grail was destroyed, and everyone lived except me and Saber.[lr]::
27199::$$$message_0232_0000_0090$$$::If you asked for any more than that, the gods would punish you.::
27200::$$$message_0232_0000_0091$$$::Huh. I heard there was the crazy idea of having an ending where Sakura, Tohsaka, Rider, and Saber were all alive.::
27201::$$$message_0232_0000_0092$$$::Uhhh...heaven?::
27202::$$$message_0232_0000_0093$$$::More like hell, if you ask me.[lr]::
27203::$$$message_0232_0000_0094$$$::Well, life's interesting since not everything goes your way. It's at its best when some people are missing in your life.::
27204::$$$message_0232_0000_0095$$$::Ah...your words are so profound![lr]::
27205::$$$message_0232_0000_0096$$$::What else should we expect from a character who's both a younger sister and an older sister at the same time!::
27206::$$$message_0232_0000_0097$$$::By the way, is Shirou your younger or older brother?::
27207::$$$message_0232_0000_0098$$$::That's a secret![lr]::
27208::$$$message_0232_0000_0099$$$::I have both attributes, and so does Shirou!::
27209::$$$message_0232_0000_0100$$$::Ah, I get it.::
27210::$$$message_0232_0000_0101$$$::But if he makes one mistake, he'll grow up to be like Archer, which makes it both interesting and sad to me... It's complicated, in my opinion.::
27211::$$$message_0232_0000_0102$$$::Well, it'll depend on how he matures, so let's count on Rin and Sakura molding him into a man.::
27212::$$$message_0232_0000_0103$$$::As I said before, [font italic=true]Fate[font italic=false] is Shirou's story. It examines how he should grow and mature as a person in the Saber and Rin routes.::
27213::$$$message_0232_0000_0104$$$::One of the answers to that is Sakura's route, [font italic=true]Heaven's Feel[font italic=false]. ::
27214::$$$message_0232_0000_0105$$$::And we don't even have to say what conclusion he came to!::
27215::$$$message_0232_0000_0106$$$::He lost many things, but he will gain so many new things from this point on.::
27216::$$$message_0232_0000_0107$$$::Yup. That's why that story comes full circle...to the grand finale.[lr]::
27217::$$$message_0232_0000_0108$$$::And it's why everyone's going to be sooo happy afterwards.::
27218::$$$message_0232_0000_0109$$$::Ooohhh, you're such a good girl. I can't believe we're learning that you're such a good person after you were taken to heaven... You're finally showing your true colors as the evil heroine.::
27219::$$$message_0232_0000_0110$$$::Hmph. That's always been my role. I have no regrets.::
27220::$$$message_0232_0000_0111$$$::The rest of the story is the battle between those who still remain. I'm going to just sit back and relax in this hot spring and watch what happens from on high.::
27221::$$$message_0232_0000_0112$$$::I see.[lr]::
27222::$$$message_0232_0000_0113$$$::Okay. Then let's wrap this up nicely with a smile, Disciple Number One!::
27223::$$$message_0232_0000_0114$$$::Ma'am, yes, ma'am! Roger that!::
27224::$$$message_0232_0000_0115$$$::Good![lr]::
27225::$$$message_0232_0000_0116$$$::This concludes [font italic=true]Fate/stay night[font italic=false]![lr]::
27226::$$$message_0232_0000_0117$$$::We're so proud you weren't discouraged playing this long game and fought till the end!::
27227::$$$message_0232_0000_0118$$$::Yep! Thanks for playing the game all the way through![lr]::
27228::$$$message_0232_0000_0119$$$::We've been dealing with the bad endings all this time, but now our job here is over.::
27229::$$$message_0232_0000_0120$$$::This is really going to be goodbye, but if there is ever another opportunity, let's meet again in the main story!::
27230::$$$message_0232_0000_0121$$$::See you! Don't die anymore, young ones!::
27231::$$$message_0232_0000_0122$$$::Bye-bye!::
27232::$$$message_0232_0001_0000$$$::Hey? By the way, Illya. Did you say you can watch what's happening from up here?::
27233::$$$message_0232_0001_0001$$$::I did. I said we can watch over the world from here. ::
27234::$$$message_0232_0001_0002$$$::Wha...d-d-d-d-don't tell me...this hot spring is...::
27235::$$$message_0232_0001_0003$$$::Um...heaven?::
27236::$$$message_0232_0001_0004$$$::Gyawaaahhh!!![lr]::
27237::$$$message_0232_0001_0005$$$::This is NOT an elegant way of ending things!::
