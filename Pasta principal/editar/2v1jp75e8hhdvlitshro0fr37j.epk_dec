34934::$$$message_0286_0000_0001$$$::Man.[lr]::
34935::$$$message_0286_0000_0002$$$::I didn't think the student council room would be closed as well.[lr]::
34936::$$$message_0286_0000_0003$$$::There's barely anybody at school, so it would be hard to ask around any further.::
34937::$$$message_0286_0001_0000$$$::"...I should go back. Fuji-nee should know something about Mitsuzuri."::
34938::$$$message_0286_0002_0000$$$::I grab my bag and go out into the hallway.[lr]::
34939::$$$message_0286_0002_0001$$$::The sky is tinted crimson.[lr]::
34940::$$$message_0286_0002_0002$$$::The sun is setting and it should get dark in an hour or so.::
34941::$$$message_0286_0003_0000$$$::I get to the stairs on the third floor.[lr]::
34942::$$$message_0286_0003_0001$$$::As I sling my bag and start to make my way back home, I hear a sound above my head.::
34943::$$$message_0286_0004_0000$$$::"Hm?"[lr]::
34944::$$$message_0286_0004_0001$$$::I look up.[lr]::
34945::$$$message_0286_0004_0002$$$::There...[lr]::
34946::$$$message_0286_0004_0003$$$::Tohsaka is standing firmly at the top of the stairs leading to the fourth floor.::
34947::$$$message_0286_0005_0000$$$::"Oh, you're still here, Tohsaka?"[lr]::
34948::$$$message_0286_0005_0001$$$::"..."[lr]::
34949::$$$message_0286_0005_0002$$$::She doesn't answer.[lr]::
34950::$$$message_0286_0005_0003$$$::First this morning and now this... I feel like her stink eye gets worse every time I see her.::
34951::$$$message_0286_0006_0000$$$::"Hm? What? If you have nothing to say, then I'm going."[lr]::
34952::$$$message_0286_0006_0001$$$::I raise my bag to show her I'm going home now.::
34953::$$$message_0286_0007_0000$$$::"...Khh."[lr]::
34954::$$$message_0286_0007_0001$$$::[font italic=true]What now?[font italic=false][lr]::
34955::$$$message_0286_0007_0002$$$::The sigh Tohsaka gives is telling me she's had it up to here.::
34956::$$$message_0286_0008_0000$$$::"I'm stunned. Coming to school without your Servant... Are you insane?"[lr]::
34957::$$$message_0286_0008_0001$$$::She mutters in a voice without emotion.::
34958::$$$message_0286_0009_0000$$$::"Of course not. Saber can't go into spirit form, so there's no way I can bring her to school."::
34959::$$$message_0286_0010_0000$$$::"Then you should skip school. A Master walking around without their Servant is like asking for others to kill you.[lr]::
34960::$$$message_0286_0010_0001$$$::...Emiya, do you know how stupid you are?"::
34961::$$$message_0286_0011_0000$$$::"Wha[line2]I'm not stupid![lr]::
34962::$$$message_0286_0011_0001$$$::Knock it off. Masters don't fight in places where others can see, right? Then during the day, especially at school, is out of the question."::
34963::$$$message_0286_0012_0000$$$::"...All right. Then, let me ask you. Is this a place where others can see?"[lr]::
34964::$$$message_0286_0012_0001$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
34965::$$$message_0286_0012_0002$$$::What is she saying? I don't need to check to see if others can see[line2]::
34966::$$$message_0286_0013_0000$$$::"Huh...?"[lr]::
34967::$$$message_0286_0013_0001$$$::How did this...?[lr]::
34968::$$$message_0286_0013_0002$$$::Conveniently, there's no one around.[lr]::
34969::$$$message_0286_0013_0003$$$::There's no one in the third floor hallway. I'm sure it's also the same for the fourth and the second floor.::
34970::$$$message_0286_0014_0000$$$::The school building, bathed in the setting sun, is completely still.[lr]::
34971::$$$message_0286_0014_0001$$$::At this rate, there must only be students or teachers on the first floor...::
34972::$$$message_0286_0015_0000$$$::"It seems like you finally understand.[lr]::
34973::$$$message_0286_0015_0001$$$::...Seriously, this morning, I was more pissed than astonished.[lr]::
34974::$$$message_0286_0015_0002$$$::I told you so many times, but you still came to get killed."[lr]::
34975::$$$message_0286_0015_0003$$$::With a harsh tone of voice, Tohsaka rolls up her left arm's sleeve.::
34976::$$$message_0286_0015_0004$$$::[font italic=true]What is...?[font italic=false][lr]::
34977::$$$message_0286_0015_0005$$$::A pale and slender arm.[lr]::
34978::$$$message_0286_0015_0006$$$::On that feminine arm...[lr]::
34979::$$$message_0286_0015_0007$$$::Something like a glowing tattoo appears.::
34980::$$$message_0286_0016_0000$$$::"...The he[line2]"[lr]::
34981::$$$message_0286_0016_0001$$$::It's not a Command Spell.[lr]::
34982::$$$message_0286_0016_0002$$$::Could that be... I don't have one, but is that a Magic Crest? The proof of a real mage family?::
34983::$$$message_0286_0017_0000$$$::"...I don't need to explain to you, right?[lr]::
34984::$$$message_0286_0017_0001$$$::This is the crystallization of the magecraft passed down by my family. I can activate any magecraft carved on here just by passing magical energy through it."::
34985::$$$message_0286_0017_0002$$$::...Right.[lr]::
34986::$$$message_0286_0017_0003$$$::A Magic Crest is like an attached engine, separate from the Magic Circuit in a mage.[lr]::
34987::$$$message_0286_0017_0004$$$::There is no complicated incantation or procedure to follow.[lr]::
34988::$$$message_0286_0017_0005$$$::It is an ultimate shortcut mechanism that makes the car called magecraft run just by turning it on.::
34989::$$$message_0286_0017_0006$$$::But consequently, the Magic Crest won't show up unless it is in use.[lr]::
34990::$$$message_0286_0017_0007$$$::A Magic Crest is like another Magic Circuit that is formed when the owner passes magical energy through it.::
34991::$$$message_0286_0017_0008$$$::"I had Archer leave. The Gandr Shot in this crest is enough for you."[lr]::
34992::$$$message_0286_0017_0009$$$::Her voice is flat, almost mechanical.[lr]::
34993::$$$message_0286_0017_0010$$$::[font italic=true]...[font italic=false][lr]::
34994::$$$message_0286_0017_0011$$$::That makes me realize that she's serious.::
34995::$$$message_0286_0018_0000$$$::"You can run away, but you'll just be making it hard on yourself. I'm going to win anyway."[lr]::
34996::$$$message_0286_0018_0001$$$::She says, coldly.[lr]::
34997::$$$message_0286_0018_0002$$$::But my mind is all over the place.::
34998::$$$message_0286_0019_0000$$$::We're going to seriously fight here...?[lr]::
34999::$$$message_0286_0019_0001$$$::Why here?[lr]::
35000::$$$message_0286_0019_0002$$$::Why now?[lr]::
35001::$$$message_0286_0019_0003$$$::Most importantly of all, why does it have to be against Tohsaka...?::
35002::$$$message_0286_0020_0000$$$::"H-hold on, Tohsaka! Are you out of your mind? We're at school! Who knows who'll come if we cause a commotion[line2]"::
35003::$$$message_0286_0021_0000$$$::"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I have a principle that I won't let the chances in front of me slip by. Sorry, but the coup de grâce comes here.[lr]::
35004::$$$message_0286_0021_0001$$$::...And besides, I don't think I can stand having you walk about so carelessly like today."::
35005::$$$message_0286_0022_0000$$$::"I-I said hold on...! I don't have any intention of fighting you[line2]"[lr]::
35006::$$$message_0286_0022_0001$$$::"Well I do...! Just prepare yourself, Shirou...!"::
35007::$$$message_0286_0023_0000$$$::Tohsaka makes a declaration of war and moves her arm.::
35008::$$$message_0286_0024_0000$$$::"Hrrk...!"[lr]::
35009::$$$message_0286_0024_0001$$$::Just what kind of magecraft is that?[lr]::
35010::$$$message_0286_0024_0002$$$::The instant Tohsaka points her left arm towards me, my vision is filled with light.::
35011::$$$message_0286_0025_0000$$$::"Ugh...!"[lr]::
35012::$$$message_0286_0025_0001$$$::It's about four steps if I leap towards the stairs leading to the second floor.[lr]::
35013::$$$message_0286_0025_0002$$$::If I'm to retreat back to the hallway, it'll also take me about four steps to get in Tohsaka's blind spot.[lr]::
35014::$$$message_0286_0025_0003$$$::There's no time. I should...[lr]::
